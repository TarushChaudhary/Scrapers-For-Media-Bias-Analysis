Though the latest Budget has made the new tax regime more attractive, experts said it should still be seen on a case-by-case basis. Here’s the comparison of the income tax slabs under the new and old tax regimes for FY 2024-25, and which is more beneficial for different types of taxpayers.
New Tax Regime (FY 2024-25)

The new tax regime, introduced in the Budget 2020, aims to simplify the tax structure by offering lower tax rates while eliminating most deductions and exemptions. Here are the revised income tax slabs under the new tax regime for FY 2024-25:

Income up to ₹3 lakh: Nil
₹3 lakh – ₹7 lakh: 5%
₹7 lakh – ₹10 lakh: 10%
₹10 lakh – ₹12 lakh: 15%
₹12 lakh – ₹15 lakh: 20%
Above ₹15 lakh: 30%
2. Old Tax Regime (FY 2024-25)

The old tax regime allows taxpayers to claim various deductions and exemptions, such as HRA, LTA, and Section 80C, among others. The income tax slabs under the old tax regime for FY 2024-25 are as follows:

Income up to ₹2.5 lakh: Nil
₹2.5 lakh – ₹5 lakh: 5%
₹5 lakh – ₹10 lakh: 20%
Above ₹10 lakh: 30%
New Tax Regime vs Old Tax Regime: Which is Beneficial for You?

1. For Low-Income Earners (Up to Rs 5 Lakh)

“For individuals with an annual income of up to Rs 5 lakh, both regimes offer similar tax benefits due to the standard deduction under the old regime and the basic exemption limit in the new regime. However, the new tax regime might be slightly more advantageous due to its lower tax rates,” a tax expert said.

2. For Middle-Income Earners (Rs 5 Lakh – Rs 10 Lakh)

Middle-income earners who have limited investments and do not claim multiple deductions might find the new tax regime more beneficial due to its lower tax rates. On the other hand, those who extensively utilize deductions under Section 80C, 80D, and HRA may save more under the old tax regime, he added.

3. For High-Income Earners (Above Rs 10 Lakh)

“High-income earners who have significant investments and claim numerous deductions will likely benefit more from the old tax regime. The higher tax rates in the new regime may offset any savings made through lower tax rates if deductions are not claimed,” the tax expert said.

4. For Salaried Individuals

Salaried individuals with substantial exemptions like HRA, standard deduction, and Section 80C investments may find the old tax regime more favorable. The new tax regime, although simpler, may not offer the same level of tax savings for those who maximise their deductions, he said.

The expert, however, added that if no or very less investments or deduction options are available, the new tax regime is beneficial for salaried individuals also, he added.

“It is necessary to do a computation on both the regimes to conclude which regime is better for salaried individuals. However, for those who have no investments, the new tax regime is better,” he said.

5. For Self-Employed Individuals
Self-employed individuals with fewer opportunities to claim deductions may find the new tax regime more appealing. The lower tax rates and simplified structure can lead to significant tax savings for those who do not have substantial investments in tax-saving instruments.

“The choice between the new tax regime and the old tax regime for FY 2024-25 depends largely on the taxpayer’s income level, investment habits, and financial goals. While the new tax regime offers simplicity and lower rates, the old regime provides substantial savings through deductions and exemptions. Taxpayers should carefully evaluate their financial situation and consult a tax advisor if necessary to make the best decision,” the tax expert said."
2024-08-16 6:26:38,en,hindustantimes.com,2024-08-16,"Budget 2024–25: Empowering women, advancing social justice",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-insight/economy/budget-2024-25-empowering-women-advancing-social-justice-101723786176612.html,,Right,Oped,"The Union Budget 2024–25 epitomises the government’s commitment to balancing high capital expenditures with robust welfare spending. This budget is designed to empower every section of society, driving socio-economic growth and development across the nation. It will empower every section of society. It reflects the government's dedication to ensuring that all Indians, irrespective of religion, caste, gender, and age, make substantial progress in realising their life goals and aspirations. The government has placed a strong emphasis on inclusive growth, focusing on four major segments of society: Garib (poor), Mahilayen (women), Yuva (youth), and Annadata (farmers).


Despite global economic uncertainties, including elevated asset prices, political instability, and shipping disruptions, India’s economic growth remains a beacon of stability. India's inflation remains low and stable, moving towards the 4% target, with core inflation (non-food, non-fuel) currently at 3.1%. Proactive government steps to ensure adequate market supplies of perishable goods have contributed significantly to this stability.
The budget marks a significant stride in promoting socio-economic development, with a strong focus on women's empowerment and social justice. The ministry of women and child development's budget has increased by 3%, from ₹25,449 crore in FY 23–24 to ₹26,092 crore in FY 24–25. Meanwhile, the department of social justice and empowerment has seen a substantial 32% increase, from ₹9,853 crore in FY 23–24 to ₹13,000 crore in FY 24–25. The budget for the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities remains unchanged at ₹1,225 crore.

The government has allocated over ₹3 lakh crore for schemes benefiting women and girls, aiming to foster women-led development. This historic allocation emphasises the government's commitment to empowering women and enhancing their role in the workforce. Key initiatives include the establishment of working women hostels in collaboration with industry partners and the creation of creches to facilitate higher participation of women in the workforce. These hostels will provide safe and convenient living arrangements for working women, while creches will support working mothers by offering reliable childcare services.

Furthermore, the government plans to partner with industries to organise women-specific skilling programmes and promote market access for women-led Self-Help Group (SHG) enterprises. These initiatives are designed to equip women with the skills needed to thrive in the workforce and support their entrepreneurial ventures, thereby driving economic growth and development.
To achieve social justice comprehensively, the government will adopt a saturation approach, ensuring that all eligible individuals are covered by various programmes, including those focused on education and health. This approach aims to empower marginalised communities by improving their capabilities and providing them with the tools needed to succeed.

Mission Shakti, a flagship initiative aimed at the empowerment of women, comprises two key components: Sambal and Samarthya. The budget for Sambal, which includes schemes for the safety and security of women, has increased from ₹462 crore in FY 23–24 to ₹629 crore in FY 24–25. This funding boost will enhance efforts to protect women from violence and ensure their safety in public and private spaces.

Samarthya, focused on the empowerment of women, has seen its allocation rise from ₹1,864 crore in FY 23–24 to ₹2,517 crore in FY 24–25. This increased funding will support various initiatives aimed at empowering women through education, skill development, and economic opportunities. By investing in these programmes, the government is fostering an environment where women can thrive and contribute to the nation's growth.

The government is committed to all-round and all-inclusive development, with a particular focus on enhancing welfare programmes for marginalised communities and improving infrastructure for social services. Central sector schemes, such as the Scholarships for Higher Education for Young Achievers Scheme for Scheduled Castes, are among the focus areas of the budget. These initiatives aim to provide educational opportunities and support to underprivileged communities, enabling them to break the cycle of poverty and achieve their full potential.

The budget underscores the government's dedication to women's empowerment and social justice. With the highest allocation for women-centric schemes in over a decade, the budget reflects a clear vision of women-led development and economic empowerment. By increasing the participation of women in the workforce, providing skilling programmes, and enabling greater market access for women SHGs, the government is paving the way for a more inclusive and equitable society.

In addition to empowering women, the budget's focus on social justice initiatives ensures that marginalised communities receive the support they need to thrive. The increased funding for critical programmes and the adoption of a comprehensive approach to social justice demonstrate the government's commitment to creating a more just and equitable society for all.

As India continues to progress towards becoming a developed nation, the budget serves as a testament to the government's unwavering commitment to fostering inclusive growth and empowering all citizens, regardless of their gender or socio-economic status"

2024-08-11 5:20:32,en,hindustantimes.com,2024-08-11,Budget 2024-25: India's energy transition plan,https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-insight/economy/budget-2024-25-indias-energy-transition-plan-101723285508424.html,,Center,,"India, targeting a $7 trillion economy and decarbonisation target by achieving 500 GW of fossil-fuel free generating capacity by 2030, needs a well-rounded strategy that harmonises economic development with environmental sustainability. To reach India’s goal of achieving 50 percent of its total installed power generation capacity come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, India must install approximately 50 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity annually for the next five years, starting in 2024. Currently, India has only been able to add around 15 GW per year. The union budget 2024-25 identified energy as a priority sector, with an overall allocation of an estimated ₹68,769 crores, a significant decrease from the previous year's allocation of ₹94,915 crores. The budget emphasises the development of new strategies for strengthening the transition to renewable energy sources and promoting energy security in terms of “accessibility, affordability, and availability.”

The Union budget has announced several initiatives including pumped storage, nuclear and thermal plants. The growth of nuclear energy in the form of small modular reactors has been emphasised, with the government planning to make it a significant portion of the energy mix for Viksit Bharat. To facilitate this, the government plans to partner with the private sector to set up Bharat Small Reactors and aims to enhance the research and development of Bharat Small Modular Reactors and newer nuclear technologies.

Although small modular reactors represent an opportunity for India to augment its energy capacity, its development along the lines of accessibility, affordability and availability could pose challenges in future, raising questions about the feasibility of the initiative. Estimates by Now Solar, an India focused renewable energy advisory and management organisation, indicate that small modular nuclear reactors are expected to be the most costly source of power and are unlikely to be available before 2030. Although a bold initiative aimed at expanding the nuclear energy component in the energy mix of India, questions regarding its economic viability remain unanswered. Over the years, nuclear policies have predominantly centred on large nuclear reactors, with no initiatives in place to foster demand and create a level playing field for new market entrants. Additionally, some nuclear reactors are under International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards due to their use of imported uranium. Without policies to stimulate market demand, this initiative risks becoming another failure. Programmes and schemes aimed at gradually phasing out fossil fuels such as harnessing of wind energy and integration of compressed biogas into the natural gas failed to receive a mention in the budget speech. The focus on nuclear energy also raises questions on the potential sidelining of such projects in the future. 

The interim budget included numerous announcements to promote green growth, with rooftop solarisation receiving a modest mention. In line with the interim budget announcement, the Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana was launched to install rooftop solar plants in 1 crore households, providing up to 300 units of free electricity per month. This scheme has seen significant interest, with over 1.28 crore registrations and 14 lakh applications, as disclosed by the finance minister in the recent budget speech. The applications received account for only about 11% of total registrations, largely because the final approval for installing solar rooftops lies with the respective state electricity boards. The capacity of solar plants depends on the transformer capacity of the area, making it challenging for state electricity boards to approve the applications. The state electricity boards, with their existing grid capacity, will not be able to approve the installations until there is an upgrade in the grid infrastructure.

The celebrated FAME Scheme, which has significantly multiplied electric vehicle (EV) registrations in the country to over 13 lakhs, is seeing a reduction in budget allocation. According to the budget estimates, the allocation for the upcoming fiscal year is 2,671 crores, as against 5,171 crores in the previous financial year. However, players can breathe a sigh of relief with the exemption of customs duties on lithium and cobalt, the two main components for lithium-ion batteries. This could pave the way for localised manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles, significantly reducing production costs and eventually making the process more cost-effective. While the boost for incentives for electric vehicles is beneficial in cutting down the tail-end emissions, there is a downside. With the increasing private vehicular population, governments often overlook the importance of public transport, particularly the rollout of electric buses. The allocations for electric buses in the union budget remained the same as those in the interim budget. To reduce overall private vehicle congestion and address vehicular pollution, there should be more focus on promoting electric buses compared to private electric vehicles. Increasing the number of buses and reducing private vehicle use can lead to a reduction in overall emissions.
Overall, while promoting economic growth along with a phased transition to renewable energy sources, presents opportunities for making India a hub of energy security by 2030, a much-anticipated year in the discourse of global sustainable development. However, the budget seems to fall short in providing clear insights into the prolonged advancement of the anticipated schemes. There is uncertainty whether these schemes will achieve their intended long-term goals due to the absence of continued and sustainable allocations in the budget. The prospect of nuclear energy gaining a focal point over the other established sources of renewable energy, despite concerns about its cost, availability and safety exemplifies the same. The inconsistent allocations across different schemes create confusion, creating a disconnect between the energy aspirations and the pronounced goals. While the budget speaks of new volumes for the advancement of sustainability, the success of the various announced schemes can only be determined with time. "

According to experts, the Mumbai real estate market is primarily led by buyers who sell small units to upgrade to larger homes. This coupled with the performance of the stock market and the upcoming assembly elections in the state may lead to property transactions cooling off in Mumbai.
Union Budget 2024-2025 proposals
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 24 had proposed to do away with the indexation benefit on sale of property, that allowed home owners the benefit of adjusting their gains against inflation. This, say real estate experts, may lead to higher tax burden on real estate transactions and severely impact property sellers.

The long-term capital gains (LTCG) has been reduced from 20% with indexation benefit to 12.5% without indexation for the real estate sector.

What is indexation?
Indexation allows one to adjust the purchase price of an asset for inflation, reducing taxable profits and tax liabilities. Without this adjustment, individuals paying tax may have to pay increased taxes despite the lower LTCG rate.
What does this mean for the Mumbai real estate market?
According to real estate experts, removal of indexation will slow down sales in the secondary market, also known as resale market in metro cities, including the Mumbai real estate market.

""The overall real estate market in Mumbai and other metro cities might be affected wherein resale transactions may slow down in the secondary market, not only in Mumbai but also in other metro cities. The mid-segment market, specifically in the range of ₹2 to ₹5 crore might be impacted and even investors might put their decision to sell on hold. Investors will now wait and watch before exiting from the property market now. Having said this, it depends on individual investment goals,” said Ritesh Mehta, Senior Director, and Head (North and West), residential services and developer initiative, JLL India, a real estate consultancy firm.

""However, it also depends on how the Indian stock market performs in the coming months. Real estate transactions are also connected with the performance of the Indian stock market,"" he added.

Another expert not wishing to be named said, ""The mid-segment and luxury segment of Mumbai real estate market is already overheated and is likely to cool off in the coming months. While we cannot say that there will be a drastic downfall, the market will reflect these changes.""

""The state of Maharashtra is expected to go for polls in the next two to three months and hence there will not be too many transactions by investors. Investors, including developers, are in a wait-and-watch mode and therefore we may see some stagnancy. While we do not see any slowdown and properties are getting registered, we have to understand that these deals were finalized in the last 90 days. Typically, the real impact of removal of the indexation benefit may be felt over the next six to nine months.""

On an average, the Mumbai real estate market has reported over 10,000 property registrations on a monthly basis of which 80% of the property registrations are in the residential segment. Experts opine that out of these 80%, a significant portion of homebuying happens on account of buyers upgrading their homes, especially post Covid-19.
Higher taxation may lead to short term disruption in the secondary real estate market
Vivek Rathi, National Director, Research, Knight Frank India, a real estate consultancy firm said, ""There could be a short term impact where the market adjusts itself to the new reality. Eventually market conditions are expected to normalize. There might be a short-term adjustment period as the market adapts to the new conditions. However, market conditions are expected to stabilize over time.""

Rathi added that if the property's value has risen more than the inflation rate, the new 12.5% tax rate is likely to be more favorable for real estate sellers compared to the previous 20% rate after adjusting for indexation.
What does removal of indexation benefit mean for plotted developments?
Investments in plotted developments picked up post Covid-19. However, real estate developers are of the opinion that the impact of changes in LTCG on plotted developments or other real estate segments is similar.

""The House of Abhinandan Lodha (HoABL) has been offering plotted developments for the past three years, and our advice to our customers has been to buy land if you plan to hold it for more than 10 years. However, if investors seek an early exit to meet any contingencies, the reduced LTCG rate from 20% to 12.5%, along with the shortened holding period from three years to two years, makes exit more attractive. While we still recommend long-term holdings, these changes offer greater flexibility for investors,"" said Abhinandan Lodha, chairman, HoABL.

On the impact of removal of indexation benefit on vertical developments, Abhinandan Lodha said that the “vertical real estate market, particularly in metros, has generally provided single-digit compounded returns and hence investors and HNIs looking to exit now will benefit from the reduced tax rate of 12.5%."""
2024-08-05 5:24:14,en,financialexpress.com,2024-08-05,Union Budget 2024: Impact of proposals and tax changes on propensity to save,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-impact-of-proposals-and-tax-changes-on-propensity-to-save-3573756/,Center,Center-Left,Oped,"Every year, the finance minister presents a Union budget, which is not only a fiscal arithmetic but also a powerful and potent tool to allocate scarce resources to different sectors. It influences the different vectors of aggregate demand: Consumption, Investment, Government Expenditure, and Net Exports. The implicit and underpinning outcome of the union budget which is often not articulated is a default choice architecture of these public policies, that it creates for the public. All public policies provide a nudge in banning undesirable outcomes, (huge tax incidence on cigarettes) while promoting desirable ones (incentivising savings), channelising investments for underdeveloped regions, or even to promote balanced growth. One of the central themes of public finance and union budget is its ability to save and invest. Taxation plays a defining role in people’s ability and inclination to save and invest.

Tax Provisions
From time to time various tax provisions first enunciated in the budget, have provided tax rebates and exemption to the public. Section 88 allowed individuals to claim tax under PPF, NSC, life insurance premiums, Infrastructure bonds, and the like. This was supplemented by Section 80C, which expanded more options for the public to invest. Section 80C was the proverbial nudge to consumers to increase propensity to save and invest.
A tax prayer could claim exemption until Rs. 1.5 lakhs. There has been a steady rise in the number of tax payers from 2.69 crores in 2005-06 to 3.36 crores in 2013 to 6.77 crores on 31 July 2023, and many of these tax payers have enjoyed exemptions. Further, Income Tax provisions also helped tax payers to avail deductions for interest on home loans. Section 80EEA of theIncome Tax Act, 1961, came into effect from April 1, 2020. It allows a deduction for interest on a loan taken for specific house property. The Indian government provides tax benefits on home loans, primarily through deductions on the principal repayment and interest payment components. These tax incentives reduce the overall cost of homeownership, making it more affordable to borrowers.

Fig 1: Tax deductions allowed for home ownership

Section 80C	Tax Deduction on Principal Repayment	Up to Rs.1,50,000
Section 24B	Tax Deduction on Interest Paid	Up to Rs.2,00,000

According to Reserve Bank’s data, credit outstanding to the housing sector, primarily comprising home loans, has increased significantly by Rs 10 lakh crore during the last two years to a staggering Rs 27.22 lakh crore as of March 2024, marking a noteworthy rise from Rs 17.26 lakh crore recorded at the end of March 2022.
The July 2024 budget has changed all that. It has removed the indexation benefit available to asset classes like real estate and brought down the capital gains tax to 12.5% from the 20% with indexation available earlier.

This has ignited a debate on the purpose behind the government’s move, and its impact.

Impact of LTCG
A BankBazaar study used RBI’s House Price Index data for 10 major cities and found out that LTCG taxes on an average, increases 2.9 times without the indexation benefit. This study is based on RBI’s House Price Index (2011-2024) and the Cost Inflation Index. This report showed that without indexation, the long-term capital gains taxes rise significantly for all holding periods. The simulated holding periods for LTCG calculations in the study, range from 2 years to 13 years ending in March 2024. The report also shows that longer holding periods correlate with higher taxes with or without indexation. With indexation, the taxes are comparatively higher.
Another finding of the report is that the average indexed tax on LTCG in these 13 years (2010-2023) is 3.90. The report also shows that this average non-indexed tax rises 2.90 times to 11.34, implying additional taxes of 7.44. The report suggests that all taxes with indexation were 0 from 2016-17 whereas without indexation, the taxes rose considerably with values of 3.02 to 8.70. The report shows that because of indexation, there is no long-term capital gains from 2016-17. These seven years show long-term capital losses. Therefore, despite the 20 percent tax rate, the investor’s tax liability would be zero in these years. However, without indexation, there are huge leaps in the LTCG for all years including from 2016-17.

Impact on Savings
An NIPFP study estimates the effect of being in a taxable income bracket on the probability of having investments in specific financial products. They do this by examining portfolio formation using the CMIE Consumer Pyramids Household Survey Data for 2016–173. They find that the probability of investments in tax-favoured financial products is higher for households that are taxed. A disaggregated analysis of salaried households suggests that the tax-incentivised impact on saving is highest for salaried households in the income bracket of Rs 350,000 to Rs 500,000.

For households not subject to tax liability, household characteristics drive the probability of investments in insurance products. Thus, while aggregate financial saving has remained stable, tax breaks have been influential in driving savings into specific products, such as insurance and pensions. Till recently, physical savings of households were increasing. Now, with this new change in Long Term Capital Gains, there will be an impact.
An appraisal of a capital gains tax includes particularly its effect on investment. Investment is one of the most important variables in economic development, and capital gains taxation is directly related to the supply of savings, the composition of investments, and the mobility of capital.

Conclusion
The union budget in the last few decades has played a defining role in providing through its provisions a discernible nudge to build public savings, the tax incentives due to savings have been provided across all asset classes,  the PPF savings which are tax exempt indirectly support the bond markets, since a great chunk goes in investment in government securities. Other tax provisions have given tax exemptions in Equity-linked schemes. ULIPs are a dual instrument to help to insure and save. In few years reality sector got a boost, where money from the sale of property was incentivised to be invested back in the realty sector. Exempting interest on housing loans from taxation, and provision of tax treatment of repaying principal amount to be included for tax exemption. All this has helped real estate as an asset class to grow. 

The history of incentivising savings, has since decades inculcated the habit of thrift among middle-class and lower-middle-class Indians. This has been the anchor and nest egg for the working-class population of India.  Unlike the developed world, there exists no social security mechanism to buffer the middle class and poor. At best by incentivising savings the government nudged and encouraged the propensity to save. However, the new tax provision provides no such incentives. A demographic dividend where a large population is entering the workforce, will be left with no nudge to save is a failing indeed."
2024-08-04 14:23:20,en,financialexpress.com,2024-08-04,Explaining Budget 2024 announcements on GST and custom duty,https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/explaining-budget-2024-announcements-on-gst-and-custom-duty/3573364/,Center,Center-Right,Oped,"The tax proposals contained in the Union Budget recently tabled before the parliament largely aim at bolstering domestic manufacturing, improving ease of doing business, reducing litigation and providing certainty in tax administration.

On the Import duty front, the emphasis is to boost domestic manufacturing, in line with the ‘Make in India’ and ‘Aatmnirbhar Bharat’ initiatives through rationalization of the Customs duty rates. Keeping in line with these objectives, certain exemptions are extended till March 2026 and 2029 respectively, whereas certain others are allowed to lapse on September 30, 2024. The rationalization of import tariffs is expected to continue further with a comprehensive review of the tariff structure announced to be undertaken in the next six months.
On the specific proposals, reduction in duty rates on mobile phones including their parts and accessories are aimed at incentivizing domestic manufacture as well as reducing prices for the end-customers. Exemptions extended to precious metals (gold, silver, platinum) along with ores and concentrates of copper, cobalt, tin and tungsten etc. as well as silicon to boost investment and manufacturing in the related sectors. In the healthcare sector, exemptions have been extended to certain life-saving drugs used for cancer treatment and polyethylene used in orthopaedic implants. 

For the renewable sector, basic customs duty is increased on solar glass for manufacture of solar cells from Nil to 10%. This is neutralized by providing exemption on certain capital goods and their parts and extending the exemptions on import of certain critical goods used in manufacture of solar cells and modules. This is expected to incentivize manufacturing of solar cells and modules in India.

Benefits under the MOOWR scheme, which allows manufacturing operations to be carried out in bonded warehouses with duty-free imports of raw material and capital goods, are proposed to be restricted for specific sectors. While this step seems to be undertaken due to certain court pronouncements for the solar power sector, the same appears to be retrograde and does not send out positive signals to the investors. This should have been avoided, given the scheme has provided a significant boost to investment in the manufacturing sector.

There are certain other steps announced to facilitate trade and resolve disputes, such as providing retrospective exemption from levy of GST Compensation Cess on imports by SEZ units, extension of time limits for duty free re-imports and relaxed documentation in support of establishing country of origin in respect of imports under the free/ preferential trade agreements. However, one wonders if a dispute resolution scheme should have been announced to resolve pending customs duty litigation.

From a GST perspective, the focus seems to create more certainty in the tax administration and dispute resolution, considering the massive surge in the GST litigation. The tone was set through various clarifications issued by the Government post the 53rd GST Council meeting and the same is furthered in the proposals.

Rationalization in the adjudication processes in relation to Notices issued for FY 2024-25 onwards, waiver in interest and penalties subject to voluntary payment of taxes for initial years of GST, consideration of industry practices for resolution of disputes, retrospective extension in the dates for availment of ITC and announcement of a sunset clause for anti-profiteering provisions are steps in the right direction which should be welcomed by the Industry.

While infrastructure was stated to be one of the focus sectors, surprisingly there is not much of a change in the rate structure for the sector and status-quo is maintained. It was widely speculated that steps may be taken to address the issue of duty inversion faced by the sector, given that the output from the sector generally enjoys exemption or lower rate of GST whereas procurements suffer tax at median rate of eighteen percent leading to credit accumulation. A ‘deemed export’ status for the sector could be considered, whereby supplies by the sector may be eligible for refund or rebate of such accumulated credits.

To sum up, while the indirect tax proposals contained in the Budget aim at creating a taxpayer friendly environment by focussing on ease of compliances and dispute resolution, it appears that Government has stopped short on taking affirmative measures which could have provided impetus to investments in key sectors and eased the burden of GST on the end consumers. However, given that this was the first budget for the newly elected Government, it certainly sets out the tone for future steps that may be undertaken in this regard in the times to come. "

2024-08-03 16:24:21,en,financialexpress.com,2024-08-03,Critical Minerals in the Union Budget 2024-2025: Steering through the Headwinds,https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/critical-minerals-in-the-union-budget-2024-2025-steering-through-the-headwinds/3572855/,Center,Center-Left,Oped,"The growing significance of critical minerals across the international community, including for developing economies like India cannot be overstated. Imperatives of India’s industrialization and Sustainable Development Goals have amplified the nation’s reliance on these minerals. With their applicability in sectors ranging from high tech and telecommunications to renewables and defence, the Economic Survey of 2022-23 deemed the critical minerals as an upcoming “geopolitical battleground”, signs of which are already apparent. The salience of these indispensable reserves is not only evident by New Delhi’s international engagement in the recent past but also by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s recent Union Budget speech in Lok Sabha.

Plans Charted in the Union Budget
The Finance Minister stated the government’s intentions to set up a Critical Mineral Mission for domestic production, recycling, and overseas acquisition of critical minerals. Its mandate would also include technology development, a skilled workforce, an extended producer responsibility framework, and a financing mechanism. Furthermore, the Minister during her speech, proposed to fully exempt customs duties on 25 critical minerals and reduce basic custom duties on two of the minerals. Both announcements entail significant implications.
Firstly, establishing a Critical Mineral Mission reflects national objectives of not only securing resilient domestic supply chains to mitigate strategic vulnerabilities presented by geopolitical uncertainties, supply chain disruptions, and import dependence on China, but also leveraging foreign reserves, technology, and capital through trusted bilateral and multilateral partnerships. Secondly, the statement is also emblematic of the official desire to foster technological advancement across the critical mineral value chains. Thirdly, the plan to exempt custom duties, besides securing the resources to strategic sectors in a cost-effective manner, is also likely to nudge India’s pace towards a clean energy transition, including the manufacturing of electric vehicles (EV). Lastly, exemption on duties would also enhance global competitiveness across a range of sectors in which the critical minerals are used for manufacturing vital components.
Addressing the Infirmities in the Supply Chains
India’s objective to develop entire value chains for the resources faces multipronged challenges. While the last four fiscal years have seen Union allocations to the Ministry of Mines, overseeing these critical assets rise, the disbursement for capital expenditure has been on a declining trend. Limited fiscal room for capital expenditure is worrying and antithetical to the budget and Critical Mineral Strategy’s focus on boosting domestic production, recycling, and innovation financing.  Increasing industrial demands for resources, and the lack of extraction, processing and recycling technology and facilities warrant a significant increase in the Centre’s allocation for capital expenditure. Given the ever-increasing long-term criticality of the minerals, it does not seem to be ideal to be primarily dependent on private or foreign direct investment.

While critical minerals are found in large volumes across the globe, extracting and refining them is not only technologically intensive but also costly. Failing to receive the required number of minimum bidders, the Ministry of Mines recently scrapped the auction of lithium blocks for the second time in five months. The lacklustre response from the investors draws from India’s outdated resource classification rules, lacking adequate information regarding the economic viability of mining a block. Information on economically viable reserves with high geological confidence remains an imperative for mining firms, given the expensive extraction process.

Unlike exploration and manufacturing, the midstream activities i.e., processing and refining, which is the most important part of critical mineral value chains have not attracted requisite attention from the government, including through recent amendment to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. Consequently, the metal refining infrastructure such as vapor metallurgy needs to be amongst the official priorities to sustainably refine these minerals, without which an indigenous reliable ecosystem for minerals would remain elusive. Attaining capabilities to sustainably transform primary and secondary sources to intermediate materials calls for investment, especially in R&D to support research beyond the current laboratory-scale studies.

Subsequent to processing and refining, manufacturing and recycling part of the value chains also merit serious discussions among the policymakers. As technology evolves, India’s economy in future will be further underpinned by technologies that depend on minerals such as lithium, graphite, cobalt, titanium, and rare earth elements. For instance, the critical minerals input required in the manufacturing of an EV is six times that of a traditional car.  Already, seven of the total thirteen sectors in the Production-Linked Incentives (PLI) scheme involve these critical assets in manufacturing vital components, such as solar PV modules and auto components. Besides, there are only seven recycling plants in India that can extract reusable materials from used batteries, which is particularly concerning given very limited domestic reserves. India’s burgeoning industrial needs, abundant e-waste and restricted mineral reserves signal the need for investment in cost-effective manufacturing and recycling plants. Amidst price volatility, surging global demand for clean energy technologies, and acute supply and geopolitical risks for minerals, including those considered critical by India, boosting recycling capabilities remains not only an environment-friendly option but also key to secure and cost-effective supply. India’s trajectory towards clean energy goals is expected to generate EV market growth at a CAGR of 49% till 2030. Thus, investing in recycling facilities that can extract and refurbish lithium-ion batteries also necessitates the government’s imminent consideration.

Recycling of critical minerals is expected to upscale going forward since one of the mandates of the Critical Mineral Mission as prescribed by the Union budget is the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework. The rules based on the concept of EPR and relevant to critical minerals are E-Waste Management Rules, 2022 and Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022. While these rules are expected to bring new technologies and investment in the recycling and refurbishment industry, both are riddled with inherent flaws.

In May 2023, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) made representation to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) asking for a one-year deferral of EPR obligations to private telecom operators. The telecom body wrote to the Ministry as the industry was not consulted regarding the average life-cycle of telecom and broadcasting equipment. The end-of-life disposal timeframe imposed under the EPR rules could increase compliance costs and capital expenditure, potentially affecting the network, since the obligations enforced are not in sync with real-world life cycles of products. Also, the weighty targets imposed which make it difficult to absorb the compliance costs as often argued by smaller businesses, merits a reappraisal. The e-waste rules also involve a stark omission. The provision for levying “environmental compensation” to producers, manufacturers, refurbishers, and recyclers for violating norms, does not contain a specified quantum of penalty. Similarly, Battery Waste Management Regulations are also not clear on the penalty imposed for violation of EPR targets and obligations. The rules for battery management also lack a directive on the funds that producers should pay to recyclers for obtaining EPR certificates or fulfilling obligations. This ambiguity can potentially affect the sum paid for waste collection and refurbishing to recyclers. It’s clear that both the rules have their respective loopholes and discrepancies which need to be resolved first, for streamlined implementation of the EPR framework.

Another line of decree entrusted in the Critical Mineral Mission is the skilling of the workforce. Having a skilled workforce and expertise across the value chains is equally salient, which would primarily require leveraging the technical expertise of Western partners like the US, and Australia through knowledge sharing and joint research arrangements. Considering India is the only developing nation in the US-led Mineral Security Partnership (MSP), it would do well to play its cards right and actualise objectives of becoming self-reliant in supply chains by collaborating in capacity-building initiatives in both upstream and midstream activities. While joint ventures in mining, processing, and R&D efforts in sustainable mining technology and extraction practices remain significant, it would serve India well to give partnership with Global South equal weightage. Collaborating with developing countries rich in mineral reserves like Argentina, Brazil and Chile is equally important in avoiding supply chain disruptions. The partnership with Latin American states cannot be merely mineral acquisition or joint exploration but also involve quid pro quo entailing Indian investments in sustainable extraction and processing infrastructure, which they lack.

Therefore, it’s clear that while the Union Budget 2024-25 strikes the right chord vis-à-vis critical minerals, the real challenge lies in implementation. India’s quest for reliable, diversified, and sustainable supply chains for critical minerals is set to be of paramount importance whilst it continues to balance environmental sustainability and developmental growth. Consequently, in the short term, the relevant waste management rules and official reporting standards need to be amended to shun ambiguities and make them attuned to the ground realities of the industry. Whereas, in the longer run, besides collaborating with like-minded and technologically advanced countries, India’s pursuit to become self-reliant across the value chains needs a significant upscale in capital expenditure, including in R&D."

2024-08-02 11:46:53,en,financialexpress.com,2024-08-02,Assessing the Union Budget 2024-25 implications for real estate,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/union-budget-2024-25-implications-for-real-estate-3572007/,Center,Center-Right,Oped,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget for FY2024-25 outlines an ambitious plan to transform India into a developed nation under the vision of “Viksit Bharat.” This budget places a strong emphasis on urban and infrastructure development, human capital enhancement, manufacturing growth, MSMEs, and driving consumption, identifying nine priority areas for sustained efforts: agriculture productivity and resilience, employment and skilling, inclusive human resource development and social justice, manufacturing and services, urban development, energy security, infrastructure, innovation and R&D, and next-generation reforms.

Not dissimilar in approach to her first budget, which was also presented after the previous Lok Sabha win, this budget largely aims for longer term goals, with a sprinkling of near-term objectives. The focus this time, however, is on a wider range of items, including agriculture, MSMEs, manufacturing, urban and infrastructure development, the start-up economy, and much more.

Urban and infrastructure development take center stage in this budget, with manufacturing and housing positioned as primary beneficiaries. The ‘Cities as Growth Hubs’ initiative aims to rejuvenate urban areas under strain. Key measures include Transit Oriented Development for 14 large cities and a framework for creative brownfield redevelopment.
A significant allocation of INR 15,000 crore for the development of Andhra Pradesh’s capital city underscores the government’s commitment to urban infrastructure. This financial support is expected to catalyze significant real estate development in the region, enhancing market confidence and encouraging investment. Additionally, the budget’s emphasis on manufacturing, through the extension of the Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs, the establishment of industrial parks and corridors, and e-commerce export hubs, is poised to boost the country’s economic performance, with the warehousing real estate segment standing to benefit significantly from these initiatives.

The budget also addresses urban and rural development through measures such as interest subsidies for rental housing, PPP models for rental housing for industrial workers, and the addition of 3 crore housing units under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). These initiatives are designed to tackle the housing shortage and improve living standards in both urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the government’s decision to increase the standard deduction and lower tax slabs in the new tax regime for personal income tax is likely to increase disposable incomes among the middle-income group, thereby boosting demand in the affordable and mid-income housing segments.

The single most spoken of point from real estate perspective is that of long-term capital gains (LTGC) tax, coupled with the removal of indexation benefits. While this sounds like an onerous burden at first, deeper analysis reveals a different picture. A full-scale analysis is out of scope for this essay here; but it is clear that properties held over long time frames that have benefitted from strong price upswings of 7-8 times attract lesser LTCG under the new LTGC of 12.5% (14.95% effective tax) without indexation, than the previous 20% LTGC with indexation. This could have far-reaching implications, especially in curbing over-zealous investor activity, as against end-use purchases.

Moreover, the budget’s capex-led growth strategy, with an outlay of 3.4% of GDP amounting to INR 11.1 lakh crore, demonstrates fiscal prudence with a planned reduction in the fiscal deficit to 4.9% of GDP. This robust financial planning, along with strategic urban development policies, is set to create new urban clusters and spur real estate development across the country.

While the direct-tax part perhaps left a bit to be desired, it needs to be remembered that the finance minister has to present another full budget in about 6-7 months. The present budget lays a solid foundation for sustained economic growth, with urbanisation, manufacturing, infrastructure, and of course real estate sector being beneficiaries at this point. Agriculture and MSMEs were big focus areas too, and as elections loom in several states, it was just about a reasonable attempt to cover various crucial sectors for an effective 6-7 month period."

Until 2020, taxpayers could file their taxes only under one existing regime – the old regime. However, in the Union Budget 2020, the government introduced a new tax regime with the aim of simplifying the tax process with lower tax rates but also fewer deductions.

As of 2024, the new tax regime, with its streamlined process but fewer deductions, is the default tax-filing regime whereas the old regime, offering multiple deductions, is still available, but no longer the default. In this scenario, it is important for taxpayers to determine which regime offers them the most benefits while aligning with their financial goals. To do this, a thorough understanding of the deductions, allowances, and exemptions offered under each regime is essential.

The old regime currently offers a variety of deductions under various sections of the Income Tax Act to help taxpayers lower their taxable income and tax liability. These include the popular Section 80C that comprises insurance premia, investments (Public Provident Fund, ELSS, Employee Provident Fund, children’s education fee, and home loan principal repayments, among others. Deductions and exemptions can also be availed for medical insurance premiums (Sec 80D), interest on education loans (Section 80E), donations to charitable institutions (Section 80G), and interest on home loans (Section 24), to name a few.

Speaking of the new tax regime, the lower tax rates it offers come at the cost of fewer deductions and exemptions, compared to the old regime. Here is a look at the deductions offered under the new tax regime as of 2024.
Standard deduction: The Budget 2024 announced a Rs.25,000 hike in the standard deduction under the new regime. The new limit is Rs.75,000. As opposed to Rs.50,000 before and will be available to all taxpayers choosing to file their taxes under the new regime.
Basic exemption limit: Under the new regime, the basic exemption limit is Rs.3 lakh. This means, income up to Rs.3 lakh will not attract no tax under the new regime.
Tax rebate: Individuals with a taxable income of up to Rs.7 lakh may be eligible for a rebate equivalent to their payable income tax on taxable income or Rs.25,000, whichever is lower.
Life insurance maturity payment: The maturity amount received in the case of a life insurance policy, the premium of which is up to 10% of the policy sum assured amount, will be exempt from tax. For instance, you have an endowment policy, the annual premium of which is Rs.23,500, that provides a sum assured of Rs.25 lakh, and a maturity amount of Rs.28 lakh. Here, the premium being paid is less than 10% of the sum assured amount, hence the maturity amount received will be tax free in the hands of the receiver.
Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) Proceeds: There will be no tax levied on amounts up to Rs.5 lakh received under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme Amounts.
Gratuity received from employer: Under the new tax regime, gratuity payments of up to Rs.20 lakh, from your employer, will be exempt from tax.
Daily Allowances: Under the new regime, taxpayers can also claim daily allowances they receive while on tour or transfer as a tax deduction. For instance, an individual goes on a 5-day business trip from work for which they are provided a daily allowance of Rs.1,000 by their employer. They will be eligible to claim the reimbursement of Rs.5,000 (Rs.1,000 x 5 days) without incurring any tax.
Conveyance Allowances: Similar to daily allowance, taxpayers can claim up to Rs.1,600/month for transport expenses. For instance, if an individual received Rs.1,500 per month for commuting, they can claim the annual amount of Rs.18,000 (Rs.1,500 x 2 months) as a tax deduction.
Transport allowances for specially-abled taxpayers: Transport allowances, up to a certain amount, received by specially-abled taxpayers can be claimed as a tax deduction. For instance, a specially-abled individual receiving Rs.3,000 per month as travel allowance can claim the amount of Rs.36,000 (Rs.3,000 x 12 months) as a tax deduction.
Cost of travel on tour/transfer: The new regime will allow individuals incurring travel expenses while on an official tour or transfer to claim such expenses without incurring tax. For instance, an employee goes on a work tour and incurs an expense of Rs.700 per day for 7 days on travel within the city. They are reimbursed for the amount of Rs.4,900 by their employer. This reimbursement will be tax-free in the hands of the individual."

Amidst expectations of economic revival and relief for various sectors, the Budget outlined a comprehensive strategy aimed at fostering inclusive growth and boosting the economy.

One of the highlights of this year’s Budget is the proposed modification of the tax slabs under the new regime, which has been a focus area of the government. In the new tax regime, the income tax rates are set to undergo the following changes:
Moreover, the standard deduction for salaried employees is proposed to increase from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000, providing further relief to taxpayers. These revisions are expected to provide tax savings up to Rs 17,500 for a salaried taxpayer under the new regime.

The Budget further proposes an increase in deduction related to family pension for pensioners opting for the New Tax Regime, raising it from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000. This is aimed at improving the financial well-being of pensioners and providing them with greater disposable incomes.
Further, in a bid to enhance social security benefits, the Budget proposes an increase in the deduction of employer’s contribution towards the National Pension System (NPS) from 10% to 14% of the employee’s salary for those opting for the new tax regime. This move is expected to encourage more taxpayers to opt for the new tax regime.

The Budget also aims to rationalize the taxation of capital gains, proposing a simplified structure. The holding period has been limited to two periods only – 12 months and 24 months – to determine if an asset is a long-term or a short-term capital asset.

Further, long-term gains on all financial and non-financial assets will now attract a uniform tax rate of 12.5%. Hence, the tax rate for long-term capital gains on STT paid listed securities and units of equity-oriented funds has increased from 10% to 12.5%, above Rs 125,000 (as against Rs 100,000 under the current provisions); however, the tax rate for long term capital gains on all other assets has been reduced from 20% to 12.5%. Moreover, the benefit of indexation, which was earlier available on long term capital assets, has been proposed to be abolished.

While for listed bonds and debentures, the rate shall be reduced to 12.5%, capital gains on unlisted debentures and unlisted bonds shall still be taxed at applicable slab rates, irrespective of whether it is a short-term or long-term gain.

Concurrently, short-term capital gains (STCG) on listed equity shares and units of equity-oriented mutual funds will see an increase in the tax rate from the existing 15% to 20%.

To ease the cashflow for salaried taxpayers, it has been proposed that the tax collected at source, or any other deduction of tax, be allowed while arriving at the remaining tax liability by employers. This is a welcome move which shall result in reducing the claims for refund while filing the tax return.

Similarly, positive changes have been proposed in the Budget to provide relief to taxpayers under the Black Money Law and in reducing the time for issuing notices for reassessment.

The above changes made by the Hon’ble FM aim to make the new tax regime more attractive, which is in line with the thinking of the government. On the contrary, the increase in the capital gains rate for STT paid listed securities and units of equity-oriented funds may dampen the spirit of investors.

Overall, the Budget seems to be moving in the direction of simplifying the tax laws, to make life easer for the taxpayers."

Comparing the allocation to various social sectors and the devolution of taxes to the States under the UPA and NDA regimes, she said the Narendra Modi-led government implemented the concept of cooperative federalism by giving due share to all States.
Countering the allegation that the Budget mentions just two States, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, Ms. Sitharaman said the Opposition created a propaganda to mislead people. “The Budget is for all States,” she said adding that the practice of mentioning the names of all States was not there during the UPA regime too. “If a State has not been mentioned in the speech, it does not mean there is no allocation for it,” she said.

She said it was wrong to calculate devolution based on gross tax receipts, and then allege that the Centre is devolving less than what is suggested by the Finance Commission. “I would like to underline our unflinching commitment to cooperative federalism. The total resources proposed to be transferred to the States in 2024-25 are estimated at ₹22.91 lakh crore. This actually entails an increase of ₹2.49 lakh crore over 2023-24,” she said.
Ms. Sitharaman said the capital expenditure too increased manifold during the last 10 years. The capital expenditure, she said, is estimated at ₹11.11 lakh crore. “This is the biggest ever allocation for capital expenditure and it shows increase of about 17% over the revised estimates and provisional actuals of 2023-24,” she said and added that during the 10 years of the UPA, it was ₹13.19 lakh crore. “Whereas during our tenure from 2014 to 2024, the allocation for capex has been ₹43.82 lakh crore from 2014-15 to 2023-24,” she said.

Replying to the discussion on the Budget of Jammu and Kashmir, she said the financial condition of the Union Territory has improved in the last two years. Earlier practices of running ‘hundis’ and overdrafts from J&K Bank have been discontinued and the day-to-day cash management is much healthier than the past, she said. “During the last four years, J&K Bank has made a remarkable turnaround. From a loss of ₹ 1,139 crore in 2019-20, the bank had a profit of ₹1,700 crore in the year 2023-24,” she added. 
On the conduct of NEET medical entrance tests, she said the entrance examination has ensured cost-effective medical education for families. “Certainly, it has hurt some vested interests, particularly those in the medical education field because no longer selling medical seats is possible. Therefore, it has hurt a lot of people. That is why a particular lobby was actively against NEET even before this NEET leak issue has come up,” she said.

On the Agnipath military recruitment scheme, the Minister said the scheme will ensure that India has younger soldiers who are on the frontline. “One of the expected outcome of the scheme is that armed forces will have a much younger force by recruiting those in the age group of 17.5-21 years,” she said. “And I don’t think there is a need for us to unnecessarily worry that this is causing some kind of distortion. Not at all. It is with the acceptance of the armed forces that it has been brought in,” Ms. Sitharaman added.

Replying to a Budget discussion in the Lok Sabha, Sitharaman asserted that no state was being denied money.
The Parliament Budget Session 2024 is currently underway. It commenced on July 22, 2024, and is scheduled to conclude on August 12, 2024.

She recalled that in the past Budgets by the UPA government also did not mention names of all states in their Budget speech.

“I have been picking up on Budget speeches since 2004-2005, 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and so on. The Budget of 2004-2005 did not take the name of 17 states. I would like to ask the members of the UPA government at that time – did money not go to those 17 states? Did they stop it?” Sitharaman said.

She was responding to comments by several opposition members that the Budget has provided funds only to Bihar and Andhra Pradesh and nothing to other states.

Sitharaman said India is the fastest-growing economy globally and has overcome the after-effects of the pandemic due to heavy capex push.

She also said the government is complying with the fiscal deficit trajectory. It will bring down the deficit to below 4.5 per cent by 2025-26 from the targeted 4.9 per cent for the current fiscal. The deficit was 5.6 per cent in 2023-24.

She said a misleading campaign is being promoted. “It pains me to know that they could say that you are not mentioned in the budget speech, you get nothing.”

“In a budget speech if a state’s name is not mentioned, this does not mean the state does not get anything,” FM clarified.

She also said that it is wrong to say only two states benefitted from the budget.

FY25 budget has not given lesser allocation to any sector compared to last year, she highlighted.

The budget aims to achieve Viksit Bharat’s vision by 2047, FM said.

The reply from the Finance Minister was addressing issues and concerns raised by opposition parties. Members of Parliament are discussing various issues, including the Union Budget, the economic situation, and other matters of national importance.

Opposition parties on Monday tore into the Union Budget saying most of the states have got nothing in the first major economic document of the Modi 3.0 government.

Treasury benches on the other hand lauded the Rs 48.2 lakh crore Union Budget presented in Parliament on July 23 saying the country has made all-round development.

Participating in the general discussion on the budget, senior BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi reeled out data on GDP growth, rising foreign exchange reserves, declining fiscal deficit and a sharp increase in foreign remittances to highlight the achievements of the government on the economic front.

Seeking to counter the charges levelled by opposition parties during the discussion regarding government favouring corporates, Trivedi said the corporate taxes have been reduced to make the industry competitive.

He pointed out that global MNCs are shifting away their base from China where corporate tax is 25 per cent.

The BJP leader also lauded the central government’s work on controlling inflation.

On the Congress party’s charge that no person belonging to SC, ST and OBC was present at the traditional ‘halwa ceremony’ held before the budget, he said, “Ye woh log pooch rahe hain, jo 60 saal se khate rahe halwa aur janta ko khilate rahe balua. (Such remarks are being made by those who keep relishing halwa for 60 years but gave nothing to the people)”.

Congress member Imran Pratapgarhi said the budget has done injustice to states, youth, farmers, women and the middle class.

He said the finance minister has spoken only 10 words on inflation at a time when tomato prices have skyrocketed to Rs 100 per kg.

Pratapgarhi described the budget as “jhoot ka pulinda” (pack of lies) and a compilation of Prime Minister’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’.

Congress MP Rajeev Shukla criticised the budget on several counts and made a strong case for a review of several provisions in the GST law to help the MSME sector.
He also said there is huge unemployment in the country and its impact was visible on the BJP’s Lok Sabha seas tally.

Shukla wondered how jobs will be generated when the capital expenditure has been reduced by Rs 1 lakh crore."

With a focus on fiscal consolidation, rationalization of taxation structure and a reboot of the manufacturing sector, the budget also prioritizes long-term goals like employment generation through incentives and skilling initiatives, crucial steps towards the goal of Viksit Bharat.
The budget reaffirms the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation, aiming for a fiscal deficit below 4.5% by FY26 after targeting a 4.9% figure in FY25 based on a realistic growth in tax revenues. From FY27, the focus will shift to a gradual reduction of the Central Government debt as a proportion of GDP. From a low of 3.4% in FY19, the fiscal deficit spiked to 9.2% in FY21 due to COVID-19, followed by a steady decline to 5.6% in FY24. The government improved on the last fiscal’s deficit target by 30 bps and now revised the current year target by 20 bps over the interim budget.
Employment Generation

Three new schemes will incentivize job creation for both new employees and employers, targeting the creation of over 2 Crore new jobs, which will positively impact private consumption over the medium term.

Manufacturing Ecosystem

The budget emphasizes the developing of a robust manufacturing sector, especially through MSMEs, to generate employment. Measures include:

– A separate guarantee fund for MSME loans up to Rs 100 Cr.

– Additional loans for stressed MSMEs.

– An expanded TReDS platform for better working capital funding.

Policies were announced to improve the manufacturing infrastructure through new industrial parks, rental housing for industrial workers, and the ship leasing industry, further supported by large outlays for skilling programs.

Infrastructure Development

With a capital expenditure allocation of Rs 11.1 tn, a 16% growth over the previous year, the government aims to accelerate infrastructure development, particularly boosting the order book of construction companies post general elections. Special focus is on infrastructural development in Bihar and AP, and tourism infrastructure in several states.

Agricultural Transformation

Policy measures to enhance crop diversity, mitigate climate risks, and moderate food inflation include initiatives for self-reliance in pulses and oilseeds and developing urban-centred vegetable production clusters. Establishing a digital land registry backbone is a pivotal reform for the agricultural sector.

Sustainability and Energy

While the budget falls short on some sustainability fronts such as EVs, it includes measures to support indigenous manufacture of batteries and solar cells by reducing customs duties on essential components. Policies to diversify alternative energy sources, such as pumped hydro projects and small modular nuclear reactors, aim to enhance the renewable energy mix in the grid, essential for achieving the 2030 SDGs.

Tax Reforms

Adjustments in tax slabs under the new regime and a moderate increase in the standard deduction will reduce tax payouts for mid-income salaried employees, potentially boosting consumption and encouraging transition to the simpler tax regime. However, higher tax payouts on capital gains will impact those with significant equity market incomes.

Overall, the 2024 budget is structured to support long-term economic growth through strategic thrust on infrastructure, manufacturing, and employment generation, aligning with the broader vision of a Viksit Bharat.

The fall was primarily due to the government announcing customs duty cuts on gold in the Union Budget 2024.
Gold rates on the MCS was up by 0.35% or ₹242, trading at ₹68,428 for 10 grams, while silver gained even more at 0.66% or ₹538, trading at ₹81,909 per kg. Spot gold prices on the international market was $2,392.32, a gain of 0.21% or $5.13, according to Bloomberg data.

In the beginning of July, gold prices on the MCX hovered at ₹71,600 per 10 grams and hit a high of around ₹74,730 in the middle of the month. After the Union Budget 2024 was presented, the prices fell sharply, hitting a monthly low of around ₹67,400 last week.

What are some experts' views on gold prices?
However, gold prices are expected to rice due to increasing hopes of interest rate cuts by the US Fed, softness in US dollar index, escalating global geopolitical tensions, and increasing physical demand in domestic markets after duty adjustments, according to a Mint report, which quoted Ajay Kedia, Director, Kedia Advisory, who is also pessimistic on silver due to weak data from China and increasing gold-silver ratio.
The report also quoted Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst of Currencies & Commodities at Reliance Securities who said, “The Fed is likely to hold rates steady as the market largely discounts a rate cut in September. BoJ is forecast to increase the rate and the Bank of England may cut the rate under the new government. The dollar index is struggling around the 104.30 mark. Moreover, the US will also come out with July non farm payrolls number. Hence from an economic data point of view, the week is crucial.”"

They rank second only to fixed deposits, according to the ‘Savings Quotient’ a BankBazaar survey of over 1,650 professionals aged 22-45 in India.

Revision on LTCG tax
In the Union Budget 2024, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed many changes to aid the simplification and rationalization of taxes with respect to listed and unlisted assets. One of the significant changes announced was a hike in the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on listed assets, specifically equity mutual funds. LTCG tax on equity was introduced in March 2018 and is applicable to the sale of long-term assets.

Following yesterday’s announcement, LTCG tax on equity mutual funds has been hiked from the previous 10% to 12.5%. At the same time, the exemption limit on certain financial assets has been increased from ₹1 lakh to ₹1.25 lakh per year.

Revised holding period – Listed & Unlisted assets
To further simplify the taxation treatment of capital gains, the Budget 2024 also revised the holding periods used to classify whether the listed and unlisted financial assets are long term or short term assets.

Financial assets listed on the recognised stock exchanges in India, such as listed stocks and bonds, Equity ETFs, Gold ETFs, Bond ETFs, Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs), and held for more than a year will be classified as long term.
On the other hand, unlisted financial assets and all non-financial assets must be held for 24 months or two years for the gains to qualify as long term gains. These include real estate, debt mutual funds, gold, gold mutual funds, unlisted shares (including shares listed abroad), foreign equity units, and debt mutual fund units acquired on or before March 31, 2023.

How Does the New LTCG Tax Affect You?
Like countess others, you too may have invested in mutual funds. However, with revised taxation of equity funds, your long term gains will not be taxed at 12.5% instead of the earlier 10%. On the other hand, long-term gains up to Rs.1.25 lakh re now exempt from tax, as opposed to Rs.1 lakh earlier. So, how do these two changes affect your investment’s bottom line? Let’s understand this with an example.

Let’s assume you have invested Rs.20 lakh in equity funds in 2020. By 2024, your funds are collectively valued at Rs.35 lakh. Let’s look at the difference in the LTCG tax you are liable to pay prior and post the Union Budget 2024 announcement.

Formula to calculate LTCG tax
Gains (minus) exemption amount * rate of tax

Here, gains are calculated by deducting the redemption amount deducted by investment amount.
From the above example, this would be Rs.35 lakh (minus) Rs.20 lakh = Rs.15 lakh

Case 1 (LTCG @10%; Exemption – Rs.1 lakh)
(Gains – Rs.1 lakh)*10%.
Rs.15,00,000 – Rs.1,00,000)*10% = Rs.14,00,000*10% = Rs.1,40,000

Case 2 (LTCG @ 12.5%; Exemption – Rs.1.25 lakh)
(Gains – Rs.1.25 lakh)*12.5%

(Rs.15,00,000 – 1,25,000)*12.5% = 13,75,000*12.5% = Rs.1,71,875

The difference in tax liability at 10% LTCG tax versus 12.5% LTCG tax is Rs.31,875. Thus, your tax liability for the same gain of Rs.15 lakh will go up by 22.8%.

The Final Word
The exemption of Rs.1.25 lakh under the new rule will only be beneficial if your gains are below Rs.2.25 lakh. In this case, the increased exemption of Rs.25,000 cancels out the hike in tax. So, if your gains are Rs.2 lakh, your tax at the previous rate would be Rs.10,000, but would reduce marginally to Rs.9,375 under the new rule, saving you Rs.625.
LTCG is applicable on long-term gains, which, for most people are investments to achieve life goals such as children’s education or retirement. Investment corpuses for these can often run in crores, especially in case of retirement. So, if you have a corpus of Rs.1 crore for retirement, you would be losing Rs.12.34 lakh from that in tax. This can significantly impact your retirement savings, requiring you to strategies to cover the loss of funds.

Somanathan",https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-has-steps-to-trigger-consumption-but-they-are-not-in-the-nature-of-direct-cash-transfers-says-finance-secretary-tv-somanathan/article68457785.ece,Left,Center-Right,,"he government is confident of launching the schemes in the Prime Minister’s package for employment and skilling announced in last week’s Budget within this financial year. That includes the internship program for one crore youth in 500 top companies, whose design details will be worked out in consultation with the industry, Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan said.

“We expect all of these schemes to start off within this financial year… We have tried to make sure the coverage of the employment-linked incentive schemes is, as far as possible, widespread, and not tried to make technological, sectoral choices. While Scheme A and C are for all industries, Scheme B is for manufacturing jobs,” Mr. Somanathan told The Hindu.

High salary cut-off
The top Finance Ministry official also said that the decision to incentivise hiring for first-timers with a salary limit of ₹1 lakh per month was aimed at keeping the schemes sector-neutral. “I agree ₹1 lakh is high, but it’s not so if you’re trying to cover the hiring of people with sophisticated skills, or knowledge of AI [Artificial Intelligence],” he said, adding that the schemes could spur new jobs in areas under threat from the advent of technologies like AI.

Referring to the recent tendency of large tech firms to defer joining dates for fresh recruits, the Secretary said that it was precisely for this reason that the government did not want to exclude such people. “We don’t want to leave out the services or any sector from possible incentivisation if it will create jobs. We don’t want to focus only on employees who draw up to ₹25,000 a month. You can pay the employee even one lakh, but our fiscal outgo is limited to the ₹25,000 level, but even 24% of that works out to 12% of a ₹50,000 salary, which is still a substantial subsidy,” he emphasised

“We don’t know where these salary figures stop. In some of these industries, even fresh hires get more than ₹50,000 to ₹60,000. But we have capped our outgo so the incentive is strongest for those earning ₹25,000,” the official noted.

‘Nothing to lose’
The new scheme to facilitate internships for youth in the age bracket of 21 to 24 years has no connection with the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0 announced in the Union Budget for 2023-24, and will be administered by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, not the Ministry of Skill Development, Mr. Somanathan underlined.

“While the Skill Development Ministry will be involved, this is very different,” he said, stressing that the scheme is voluntary and will not require firms to invest funds from their own pockets, but rather through their mandated corporate social responsibility (CSR) spends, combined with government resources.

“This particular scheme has not been discussed with industry chambers, but they have repeatedly said they are willing to collaborate on skilling because they see it as a national problem. We think many companies will respond positively. They have nothing to lose and everything to gain,” he averred, adding that firms are not expected to hire these interns.

Bridging the gap
“We are also open to the company doing the skilling through companies in the backward or forward supply chains, if they can’t do it themselves. We will work out the details. It’s an innovative approach and there will be design challenges. But I think we have to do something innovative to bridge the gap [between skill sets of the young and industry needs] and break this barrier,” Mr. Somanathan underlined.

The employment prospects of these interns will improve after their resumes, which previously said ‘no experience’, can add a year-long internship with a big company, Mr. Somanathan pointed out.

“This is a space where frankly, while everybody agrees that something is to be done, very few people have concrete ideas on what can the government do to promote employment. We are relying on basic micro economics, that a subsidy triggers additional expenditure in the item which is subsidised,” he summed up."
