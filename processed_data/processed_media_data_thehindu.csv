thehindu.com,"FM Nirmala Sitharaman on Budget 2024: Union Budget strikes a fine balance between growth, employment, capital investment, and fiscal consolidation","Replying to the debate on the Union Budget in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday where more than 80 elders participated, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the transfer of resources to the States is going unhindered and the inferences that she mentioned just two States in the budget was a propaganda created by the INDIA bloc to mislead the people.

Comparing the allocation to various social sectors and the devolution of taxes to the States under the UPA and NDA regimes, she said the Narendra Modi-led government implemented the concept of cooperative federalism by giving due share to all States.

Countering the allegation that the Budget mentions just two States, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, Ms. Sitharaman said the Opposition created a propaganda to mislead people. “The Budget is for all States,” she said adding that the practice of mentioning the names of all States was not there during the UPA regime too. “If a State has not been mentioned in the speech, it does not mean there is no allocation for it,” she said.

She said it was wrong to calculate devolution based on gross tax receipts, and then allege that the Centre is devolving less than what is suggested by the Finance Commission. “I would like to underline our unflinching commitment to cooperative federalism. The total resources proposed to be transferred to the States in 2024-25 are estimated at ₹22.91 lakh crore. This actually entails an increase of ₹2.49 lakh crore over 2023-24,” she said.

Ms. Sitharaman said the capital expenditure too increased manifold during the last 10 years. The capital expenditure, she said, is estimated at ₹11.11 lakh crore. “This is the biggest ever allocation for capital expenditure and it shows increase of about 17% over the revised estimates and provisional actuals of 2023-24,” she said and added that during the 10 years of the UPA, it was ₹13.19 lakh crore. “Whereas during our tenure from 2014 to 2024, the allocation for capex has been ₹43.82 lakh crore from 2014-15 to 2023-24,” she said.

Replying to the discussion on the Budget of Jammu and Kashmir, she said the financial condition of the Union Territory has improved in the last two years. Earlier practices of running ‘hundis’ and overdrafts from J&K Bank have been discontinued and the day-to-day cash management is much healthier than the past, she said. “During the last four years, J&K Bank has made a remarkable turnaround. From a loss of ₹ 1,139 crore in 2019-20, the bank had a profit of ₹1,700 crore in the year 2023-24,” she added.

On the conduct of NEET medical entrance tests, she said the entrance examination has ensured cost-effective medical education for families. “Certainly, it has hurt some vested interests, particularly those in the medical education field because no longer selling medical seats is possible. Therefore, it has hurt a lot of people. That is why a particular lobby was actively against NEET even before this NEET leak issue has come up,” she said.

On the Agnipath military recruitment scheme, the Minister said the scheme will ensure that India has younger soldiers who are on the frontline. “One of the expected outcome of the scheme is that armed forces will have a much younger force by recruiting those in the age group of 17.5-21 years,” she said. “And I don’t think there is a need for us to unnecessarily worry that this is causing some kind of distortion. Not at all. It is with the acceptance of the armed forces that it has been brought in,” Ms. Sitharaman added.",Left,Center-Right,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-strikes-a-fine-balance-between-growth-employment-capital-investment-and-fiscal-consolidation-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-tells-rajya-sabha/article68468428.ece
thehindu.com,Parliament Monsoon Session Highlights: Opposition MPs raise Delhi coaching centre deaths,"July 29, 2024 13:39

Mainpuri MP Dimple Yadav proposes formative changes required in the country

Speaking at the discussion of the Union Budget, Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav argued that reformative changes and evolution can come in the country even after eleven years, however, it would require “dedication and concentration”. Ms Yadav proposed that instead of focussing on the past, it was imperative that government acts responsibly and responds adequately to evolving situations.

During her address, the Mainpuri MP touched upon various issues relevant to agriculture and employment.

About agriculture, Ms Yadav sought what the treasury had allocated for building necessary agricultural infrastructure, building mandis in Uttar Pradesh and towards cattle management. She also sought the government to put forth how much allocation has been curtailed for crop insurance.

About unemployment, the Mainpuri MP sought that the government must ensure 100 days of wages under MNREGA. She put forth that employment was as high as 9.2% with unemployment among women being further high at 18.5%.

With respect to education, Ms Yadav accused the treasury of having curtailed funds to the UGC. According to her, the intent of the treasury in this regard was “questionable”.

In her address, Ms Yadav also sought the intervention of both the central and state govts to make operational the Cancer Institute in Lucknow. “Cancer cases are on the rise in the country. I am sure that making operational the institute would be a step towards according affordable treatment,” she told the house.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-session-live-updates-july-29/article68459144.ece
thehindu.com,What are the political implications? - The Hindu,"In a Budget speech sans poetry but filled with political pragmatism, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman kept her focus on addressing youth unemployment, while also offering special packages to keep crucial allies — the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) governing Andhra Pradesh, and the Janata Dal (U) in power in Bihar — on her side.

Rising unemployment, the lack of avenues to government jobs, and the leakage of question papers for recruitment exams even when vacancies were announced were all issues that weighed heavily on the BJP in the recent Lok Sabha election. In the Union Budget for this year, therefore, this sector has been addressed via a series of incentive schemes that will, it is hoped, help young, first-time job seekers with finding employment.

thehindu.com,"Budget 2024: New job schemes to kick off this year, says Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan","The government is confident of launching the schemes in the Prime Minister’s package for employment and skilling announced in last week’s Budget within this financial year. That includes the internship program for one crore youth in 500 top companies, whose design details will be worked out in consultation with the industry, Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan said.

“We expect all of these schemes to start off within this financial year… We have tried to make sure the coverage of the employment-linked incentive schemes is, as far as possible, widespread, and not tried to make technological, sectoral choices. While Scheme A and C are for all industries, Scheme B is for manufacturing jobs,” Mr. Somanathan told The Hindu.

High salary cut-off

The top Finance Ministry official also said that the decision to incentivise hiring for first-timers with a salary limit of ₹1 lakh per month was aimed at keeping the schemes sector-neutral. “I agree ₹1 lakh is high, but it’s not so if you’re trying to cover the hiring of people with sophisticated skills, or knowledge of AI [Artificial Intelligence],” he said, adding that the schemes could spur new jobs in areas under threat from the advent of technologies like AI.



Referring to the recent tendency of large tech firms to defer joining dates for fresh recruits, the Secretary said that it was precisely for this reason that the government did not want to exclude such people. “We don’t want to leave out the services or any sector from possible incentivisation if it will create jobs. We don’t want to focus only on employees who draw up to ₹25,000 a month. You can pay the employee even one lakh, but our fiscal outgo is limited to the ₹25,000 level, but even 24% of that works out to 12% of a ₹50,000 salary, which is still a substantial subsidy,” he emphasised

“We don’t know where these salary figures stop. In some of these industries, even fresh hires get more than ₹50,000 to ₹60,000. But we have capped our outgo so the incentive is strongest for those earning ₹25,000,” the official noted.

‘Nothing to lose’

The new scheme to facilitate internships for youth in the age bracket of 21 to 24 years has no connection with the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0 announced in the Union Budget for 2023-24, and will be administered by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, not the Ministry of Skill Development, Mr. Somanathan underlined.

“While the Skill Development Ministry will be involved, this is very different,” he said, stressing that the scheme is voluntary and will not require firms to invest funds from their own pockets, but rather through their mandated corporate social responsibility (CSR) spends, combined with government resources.

“This particular scheme has not been discussed with industry chambers, but they have repeatedly said they are willing to collaborate on skilling because they see it as a national problem. We think many companies will respond positively. They have nothing to lose and everything to gain,” he averred, adding that firms are not expected to hire these interns.

Bridging the gap

“We are also open to the company doing the skilling through companies in the backward or forward supply chains, if they can’t do it themselves. We will work out the details. It’s an innovative approach and there will be design challenges. But I think we have to do something innovative to bridge the gap [between skill sets of the young and industry needs] and break this barrier,” Mr. Somanathan underlined.

The employment prospects of these interns will improve after their resumes, which previously said ‘no experience’, can add a year-long internship with a big company, Mr. Somanathan pointed out.

“This is a space where frankly, while everybody agrees that something is to be done, very few people have concrete ideas on what can the government do to promote employment. We are relying on basic micro economics, that a subsidy triggers additional expenditure in the item which is subsidised,” he summed up.

thehindu.com,Union Budget 2024: Real estate sees marginal benefits,"Covering a wide spectrum of Indian sectors, the first Union Budget of Modi 3.0 focused on MSMEs, employment, skilling, youth, and the middle class. Yet, the Budget as such has failed to address several concerns of the real estate sector, including direct incentives to boost the affordable housing sector. It was widely anticipated that affordable housing will get a major boost in the current Budget because its performance has been on a decline.

With an eye on the housing needs of the urban poor and the middle class, the government has announced that it intends to construct an additional one crore homes under PMAY Urban 2.0 with an outlay of ₹10 lakh crore. It remains to be seen how effectively this would work for the benefit of those in the affordable housing segment.

Mega allocation for the Hyderabad-Bengaluru industrial corridor and Vizag-Chennai corridor will boost growth along these corridors and consequently boost real estate growth there. The Finance Minister also tried to rejuvenate the MSME (Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) sector, which does have a multiplier effect on overall economic growth — with the implied positives for real estate being a collateral beneficiary of such growth.

The credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs will help provide impetus to overall industrial development, and this can have a rub-off effect on the real estate sector. The pandemic had a catastrophic impact on the MSME sector, which slowed down the demand for affordable housing from 2020. Affordable housing demand may gain momentum once the economic impact of the pandemic subsides for this target audience.

This is certainly pertinent — the affordable homes category (less than ₹40 lakh) has been seeing a decline in overall sales since the pandemic, to approximately 19% in H1 2024 from over 38% in the period before the pandemic in 2019. Consequently, this segment’s percentage share of the total housing supply in the top 7 cities also fell to 18% in H1 2024 from nearly 40% in 2019. Any boost to this vital segment is therefore welcome.

For individual taxpayers under the new tax regime, the increased standard deduction limit to ₹75,000 from the previous ₹50,000 along with the new income tax slabs implies savings, but hardly enough to boost housing demand.

With regards to the withdrawal of indexation benefits announced in the Budget, factors such as the amount of appreciation will determine whether the new tax (minus indexation) will be advantageous or disadvantageous for sellers. It is best to consult a tax expert for this, but as it seems now, when the difference between the purchase price and the sale price (in a 10-year period) is higher (say, more than 2-2.5 times), then the new tax regime without indexation is more lucrative for the buyers.

However, when the difference between the purchase price and sale price is lower, then the old tax regime with indexation is more lucrative for the buyers.

Selvaperunthagai on Friday, July 26, 2024 announced his party will stage a demonstration on Saturday condemning the Union government for allegedly ignoring Tamil Nadu in the Union Budget 2024.

In a statement, Mr. Selvaperunthagai alleged that the BJP was not able to tolerate rejections by people of Tamil Nadu in 2019, 2021 and 2024 elections. “Instead of serving the whole country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been showing discrimination in allocation of funds to States ruled by the INDIA bloc, including Tamil Nadu. Mr. Modi had allocated more funds to a few States, only to save his government.”

The Congress leader, in his statement, listed several projects proposed in Tamil Nadu including All India Institute of Medical Science at Madurai, Metro rail projects in Coimbatore and Madurai, and said the progress of these projects were halted for political reasons. He also alleged that the Centre had released only ₹276 crore for flood relief against ₹37,000 crore demanded by the State government.

thehindu.com,"‘Budget 2024-25 transformative, forward looking’","Industry leaders and representatives have termed the Union Budget presented by Finance Nirmala Sitharaman “transformative and forward looking due to its emphasis on capacity building and boosting agricultural production.”

Neeraj Akhoury, President, Cement Manufacturers’ Association (CMA) and Managing Director, Shree Cement Ltd. said, “Against the backdrop of global uncertainties and inflation, the Union Budget 2024-25 is transformative and forward looking with an eye on fiscal consolidation.”

“The announcement of ₹11 lakh crore capital expenditure signifies the Government’s commitment to modernising India’s infrastructure through various significant projects and allocations, which will undoubtedly drive demand for cement and other building materials,” he added.

Abhinandan Lodha, Chairman, The House of Abhinandan Lodha said, “The 2024-2025 Budget is a growth-centric blueprint with profound implications on employment and employability through real estate, infrastructure, and tourism.”

“This Budget marks a significant shift towards holistic growth, focusing on affordable housing. The allocation of ₹2.2 lakh crore for constructing one crore houses in urban areas and two crore houses in non-urban areas demonstrates the government’s commitment to improving living standards,” he added.

Arun Alagappan, Executive Chairman, Coromandel International Ltd., said, “With agriculture remaining the backbone of the Indian economy, we welcome the Union Budget’s emphasis on ensuring food security, strengthening rural economy, as well as building resilience and productivity in agriculture.”

“The proposed comprehensive review of the agricultural research setup to focus on improving productivity and developing climate resilient crops will lend an impetus to ensuring that Indian agriculture can withstand climate impact. The initiative to bring together experts from both the government and the private sector will lend a much-needed fillip to the R&D in the agri sector,” he added.

N. Venu, MD & CEO, India and South Asia, Hitachi Energy said, “The Union Budget presented by the Finance Minister took a strategic middle path and democratised growth for the people through modernising agriculture, jobs in manufacturing, urban development, energy access and energy security.”

“The proposed bill did not single out any specific industry, instead the thrust was on job creation. It focused on the employee-employer experience from incentivising integration of new, young and diverse people into the workforce to using private sector as partners for skilling of future talent,” he added.

N.D. Mali, Founder, KDM in a statement said, “Tax reduction of up to 15% on mobile phones, mobile PCBs, and chargers is expected to boost domestic manufacturing and benefit customers. The Budget focus on employment, skilling and middle class will spur consumer spending, which, in turn, would stimulate economic growth.”

“The fiscal prudence of 4.9% and increased outlay of capex will put more money in the hands of people and general consumer sentiment will increase. The Budget will further charge the economy of Bharat,” he added.

Sanjay Salunkhe, CMD, Jaro Education said “The Budget has struck the right balance to enhance the education and employment sector. The Finance Minister’s financial support for loans up to ₹10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions is a commendable initiative.”

“This will provide ample opportunities for upskilling the youth and budget emphasis on education, skilling, and job creation will foster long-term growth for corporates like us who have been striving to make youth of the country employable,” he added.",Left,Center Right,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget-2024-25-transformative-forward-looking/article68446846.ece
thehindu.com,Budget 2024 Analysis: A look at the sector-wise allocations in ten charts,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Tuesday, presented the first Union Budget of the third term of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. The Hindu Data team has compiled a series of graphs to analyse the impact of the Budget on select sectors and schemes.

Data shows that expenditure as a share of the total budget on infrastructure has increased. In contrast, expenditure on major schemes in the social sectors, which includes education, pension and health, have either stagnated or declined. Spending on agriculture too, when considered as a share of the total budget, has stagnated.

Before delving into individual sectors and schemes, the graph below provides an overview.

The graph below depicts the budgeted expenditure (Rs crore) for FY25BE and the change from FY24RE in percentage points. The bigger the rectangle, the higher the allocation for a sector. The deeper the blue, the higher the increase compared with FY24RE. The deeper the red, the higher the decrease compared with FY24RE.

As usual, interest payments garnered a lion’s share of the budget this year. In absolute figures, Rs 11,62,940 crore was allocated for interest payments. If expressed as a share of FY25BE’s total Budget, it comes to 24.12%, which is 0.62 percentage points more than its share in FY24RE. Apart from interest payments, the transport sector formed the bulk of the expenditure in FY25BE at 11.29%. However, transport’s share in the total Budget came down by 0.4% points from last year.

The allocation to agriculture remained stagnant at around 3.1% of the total budget. Allocation to flagship schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PMKSN), as a share of total budget, declined in FY25BE.

Defence expenditure as a share of the total Budget declined to 9.43%, the lowest in at least nine years. In fact, defence expenditure in absolute terms has also declined. Allocations to the departments of Space have stagnated, while the Science and Technology ministry’s share in total Budget has improved slightly to 0.17%.

Allocations to all the schemes under the Space sector, as a share of total budget, have stagnated.

Allocations for various social sectors such as health, rural development and education as a share of the total budget have stagnated or declined, with the social welfare sector being the only exception – whose share improved to 1.17% of the total budget in FY25BE.



Outlays to schemes under social sectors such as MGNREGA, Samagra Shiksha, Ayushman Bharat, old age pension, widow pension, Swasthya Suraksha, have all declined in the recent years. Allocation to Ayushman Bharat has remained more or less the same in recent years after a sharp increase seen in FY23.

The Transport sector on the other hand has formed a bulk of this year’s expenditure. Allocation to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) and the telecom department has remained consistently high. Allocations to the power sector too have improved marginally from last year.

While the outlays to implement housing in urban & rural areas, and other basic amenities in urban areas improved marginally in FY25BE, allocations to smart city missions, as a share of the total Budget, has plunged.

In FY25BE, the Railway Ministry outlay in the overall budget continued to be over the 5% mark. Allocations for the signalling and telecom works, under which KAVACH (automatic train collision system for trains) is included, increased compared with FY24RE

However, allocations for the Aviation Ministry which has remained consistently low in recent years declined marginally. The outlay for the Shipping Ministry has also stagnated.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Hemant Soren accuses Centre of neglecting Jharkhand,"The Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren slammed the Centre for neglecting the State in the Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party leaders are silent over the dues from the Centre. He also claimed that the Centre owes ₹1.36 lakh crore to the State and demanded that its dues be paid by the Union government.

Reacting on the 2024 Budget, Mr. Soren said on X (formerly Twitter) account, “Is Hemant Soren guilty of this discrimination, Babulal Marandi ji? Centre owes us ₹1.36 thousand crore but every BJP leader including Babulal ji is silent on this issue. Give a special package to the political parties that support you and pay our dues. Raghubar Das had left behind DVC’s dues of ₹5,000 crore - which the Centre had deducted from our account without informing us and BJP leaders were clapping. Why are we being neglected despite giving 12 out of 14 MPs in 2014 -2019 and today 9 MP.”

In charts: Key takeaways from Union Budget 2024-25

He also made an indirect attack on the Narendra Modi government for giving special packages to Bihar and Andhra Pradesh because Nitish Kumar led Janata Dal-(United) and Chandrababu Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party (TDP) are the key alliance partners supporting the government at Centre.

Mr. Soren further said, “Jharkhand BJP has maintained silence on the friendly Budget presented yesterday. No leader is ready to say anything and secretly admitting that nothing could be worse than this. They are also angry that Jharkhand did not get anything but not ready to say anything due to fear. The people of Jharkhand have neither any expectation nor any hope of getting their rights from such cowardly/sycophantic leaders. Jharkhand always gave the maximum number of MPs to BJP but in return we got only disrespect. Note - After this tweet, maybe their self-esteem will rise and they will show the strength to say something, but the whole expectation is of flattery only.”

Announcing a host of developmental projects in the Union Budget, Ms. Sitharaman proposed a total outlay of ₹58,900 crore for various projects in Bihar, where Assembly elections are due next year, and ₹15,000 crore for the 2024-25 fiscal for the development of Andhra Pradesh’s capital city, a dream project of Mr. Naidu.

Asked about the allegation levelled by Mr. Soren, Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Pratul Sahdev described the budget as inclusive and taking care of all sections.

He said that Jharkhand will directly benefit from the road map for the development of the Purvodaya Yojana and eastern India will also catch the pace of development like the rest of the country.

“With the continuation of funding of the Aspirational District Scheme, 19 districts of Jharkhand will continue to receive central funds directly. The development of tribal-dominated Jharkhand will accelerate with the start of the Tribal Advanced Village Scheme. Apart from this, Jharkhand will definitely get a share of all the schemes of the Centre. Mudra loan has so far helped in providing self-employment to more than 30 crore people. By increasing its limit to ₹20 lakh, small businessmen and those starting a new business will get a big benefit,” Mr. Sahdev told The Hindu.",Left,Left,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-cm-hemant-soren-slams-bjp-led-centre-for-neglecting-jharkhand/article68440268.ece

However, it is not immediately known for which key projects the funds have been allocated by the Railways. The interim Budget last February has earmarked ₹2,744 crore, seven times higher than the average outlay of ₹372 crore made by the second United Progressive Alliance government in the 2009-2014 period.

Among the various works, line doubling received a major thrust with the interim Budget setting aside around ₹1,072.5 crore. A sum of ₹105 crore was set aside for Ernakulam–Kumbalam (7.71 km) doubling works followed by ₹102.50 crore for Kumbalam–Turavur (15.59 km) patch doubling, ₹500 crore for Turavur–Ambalappuzha (50 km) track doubling, and ₹365 crore for Thiruvananthapuram–Kanyakumari (86.56 km) track doubling. The interim Budget had also earmarked ₹100 crore for the Angamaly–Sabarimala Sabari rail project.

It is expected that all these projects will be given priority while allocating funds in the new Budget. Speaking to mediapersons, Mr. Vaishnav said in Kerala, in the last 10 years, the daily average electrification of rail lines increased to 49 km compared to 10 km during 2009-14.

A total of 106 rail overbridges and under-bridges had been constructed in the State since 2014 and 35 railway stations, including Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Kollam, Guruvayur, Thrissur, Punalur, Chalakudy, Kozhikode and Alappuzha, would be upgraded as Amrita Bharat Railway Stations.

Manish Thaplyal, Divisional Railway Manager, said the division had achieved a speed increase of 20% for freight trains, an increase in passenger earnings by 12%, and was making rapid progress in the redevelopment of 15 stations under Amrit Station scheme.

thehindu.com,"Budget 2024: With ₹2.65 lakh crore outlay, Railways to prioritise safety","The Ministry of Railways has received a record allocation of over ₹2.55 lakh crore in financial year 2024-25, which is a jump of 5.85% from the previous year’s ₹2.41 lakh crore, according to Union Budget documents.

The total outlay provided for capital expenditure includes ₹2.52 lakh crore from general revenues, ₹200 crore from Nirbhaya Fund, ₹3,000 crore from internal resources and ₹10,000 crore from extra budgetary resources, bringing it up to ₹2.65 lakh crore. This amount will be spent on assets, acquisitions, construction and replacement, the Budget document stated.

In 2014, only ₹35,000 crore was spent towards capital expenditure on railways. “Compared to that, current Budget estimates are a record allocation for capital expenditure for railways. And a majority of this fund will be spent on ensuring safety works,” Mr. Vaishnaw said.

The actual operating ratio of the railways for FY2022-23 stood at 98.10%. In Budget Estimates of FY2024-25, this has gone up a bit to 98.22%. Operating ratio is number of rupees spent to earn every hundred rupees.

He said the priority of railways will be safety first, comfort, increase in capacity and also in infrastructure.

Kavach installation

thehindu.com,"Basic Custom Duty for Mobile, Budget 2024: Nirmala Sitharaman announces duty cut on mobile phones, PCBA and chargers","Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech on July 23, announced a cut on basic custom duty (BCD) to 15% on mobile phones, mobile printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) and mobile chargers. Currently, the BCD on them is 20%.

It is being speculated that this 5% window might impact the end pricing of smartphones in near future.

While presenting the Union Budget of 2024-25, the Finance Minister said, “With a three-fold increase in domestic production and almost a 100-fold jump in exports of mobile phones in the last six years, the Indian mobile industry has matured. In the interest of consumers, I now propose to reduce the basic customs duty [BCD] on mobile phone, mobile PCBA, and mobile chargers to 15%.”

Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), a body of the mobile and electronics industry, said, “We are impressed with its intent and direction focusing on enhancing manufacturing and export competitiveness. Hon’ble Finance Minister has also acknowledged the tremendous growth of mobile phone manufacturing and exports.”

He added that ICEA recommended reducing BCD on mobile phones, its PCBA and charger to 15%, which has been accepted.

The mobile and electronics industry is elated with the announcements and will go a long way to enhance manufacturing, exports and our competitiveness, said Mr. Mohindroo.

“The move to reduce the basic customs duty on mobile phones, PCBAs, and mobile chargers to 15% is a progressive step that highlights the maturity and growth potential of the Indian mobile industry. This reduction will not only benefit consumers but also bolster our domestic manufacturing capabilities, allowing India to compete more effectively on the global stage,” said Anand Dubey, CEO, Indkal Technologies.

The proposed exemptions on key components like oxygen-free copper and parts for connectors are also commendable steps that will further strengthen our electronics manufacturing ecosystem, added Mr. Dubey.

“The proposal to reduce the basic customs duty on mobile phones, mobile PCBA, and mobile chargers to 15% is a positive step,” said A. Gururaj, MD of Optiemus Electronics.

“We welcome the Budget 2024 announcement to reduce BCD on mobile phones, PCBA and chargers, while simultaneously extending exemptions on raw materials for smartphone manufacturing, capital goods, and inputs for capital goods in the electronics industry,” said Muralikrishnan B, President, Xiaomi India.

“At Xiaomi India, we have been manufacturing nearly 100% of our smartphones locally with a strong emphasis on sourcing components like PCBA, charging cables, camera modules, and mechanics, among others. Today’s announcement will help further strengthen the domestic electronics manufacturing ecosystem.”

“We appreciate the government’s emphasis on increasing women’s participation in the workforce and the employment-linked incentives for first-time employees.

The presentation on July 23 was the first Budget by the BJP-led NDA government since it was re-elected in June.

Employment and Education Budget

Ms. Sitharaman announced three new employee-linked incentive schemes in the Union Budget. The three schemes, which are part of the Prime Minister’s package, will align with enrolment in the Employee Provident Fund Organisation and focus on the recognition of first-time employees, as well as support to both employers and employees.

Students who have not yet benefited from any government schemes will get support loans of upto ₹10 lakh for education in domestic institutions. E-vouchers for this purpose will be provided directly to 1 lakh students each year for interest subvention of 3% of the loan amount.

The government will support building of expressways in Bihar at a total cost of ₹26,000 crore. Power projects, new airports, medical colleges and sports infra will be also constructed in the state.

The Finance Minister made a series of announcements for Andhra Pradesh, which elected the NDA Government in the recently-concluded General Elections.

Whilst the rate of taxation remains unchanged, the size of each of the slabs, excluding the initial zero to ₹3 lakh, remains unchanged. The erstwhile slab of ₹3 lakh to ₹6 lakh would now be expanded to ₹3 lakh to ₹7 lakh. However, the rate of taxation, that is 5%, remains unchanged. Similarly, the other slabs, that is, ₹6 to 9 lakhs, ₹9 to 12 lakhs, ₹12-15 lakhs and thereby beyond, would be revised to ₹7-10 lakhs, ₹10-12 lakhs, ₹12-15 lakhs and thereby beyond.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/highlights-of-budget-2024/article68435702.ece
thehindu.com,Union Budget 2024: Nirmala Sitharaman scraps Angel Tax on foreign investments amid startup funding winter,"In a major respite for India’s fledgling startups, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, presenting the Union Budget in Parliament on July 23, announced scrapping the contentious Angel Tax on foreign investments received by such enterprises, a development that should ease the financing woes of startups, following what they call a funding winter in the past year.

Follow LIVE updates from The Hindu’s coverage of the Union Budget 2024

Ms. Sitharaman introduced the measure stating that it would help “bolster the Indian start-up ecosystem, boost the entrepreneurial spirit and support innovation”.

The tax was introduced during the UPA government while outlining measures the NDA government took to ease the growth of startups, she said in a press briefing on July 23 afternoon. While answering queries about the possibilities of money laundering due to the abolition, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said “there are other provisions in the Income Tax (Act) itself to find out the source of these funds” and that the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) continued to be in existence. The existent laws were sufficient to cater to it, Mr. Malhotra added.

“We hope that even some of the past investments which are not already under dispute will probably have a little more benign outlook from the tax department,” Ashish Aggarwal, Vice President & Head of Public Policy at NASSCOM, told The Hindu.

“This new development will lead to a cessation of fresh litigation. Furthermore, funds that would have been tied up in deposits for cases involving notice issuance cease” said Brijesh Damodaran, Partner at Auxano Capital.

The abolition of angel tax assumes significance as it comes at a time when startups funding dropped 60% in 2023 to $10 Billion, according to data in the Indian Tech Startup Funding Report 2023, from Inc42, a private startup media and information platform. The decline is more than 40% in 2022.

The tax was opposed by several industry players as they believed it curbed foreign investment and deterred the growth of startups. Angel tax was originally introduced in 2012 to curb possible money laundering by foreign participants, by investing in overvalued unlisted firms. The unintended consequences were faced by startups, for which investments are made based on the potential value of the business, unlike in regular firms which are valued on their current worth. This imposed tax liabilities in the incubation and early funding stages of startups, deterring their growth.

“This decision is a welcome step towards providing tax certainty, preventing unintended consequences on foreign investments, and supporting startups” said Rahul Charkha, Partner at a legal firm Economic Laws Practice.

Despite opposition from various stakeholders, including the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), the government held on to levying angel tax. Moreover, the income tax rules amendments in September 2023 included changes in calculating fair market value of shares and a threshold for considering a share as “overvalued” among others. One of the main intentions of the amendment was to bring in parity between domestic and foreign investors.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2024-nirmala-sitharaman-scraps-angel-tax-on-foreign-investments-amid-startup-funding-winter/article68437487.ece

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Fillip to clean energy schemes,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget address gave a fillip to several commitments made in the interim Budget in February to incentivise clean energy but stopped short of announcing new schemes.

The Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojna, which aims at providing subsidised rooftop solar installations to one crore households, has been allocated nearly ₹10,000 crore this year. This is more than twice the ₹4,970 crore that was spent, as part of the solar power (grid), last year.

Follow live updates from the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024

The scheme offers 300 units of free electricity and, as The Hindu reported, households interested in availing the scheme’s benefits will have to pay a minimum of ₹20,000 depending on the power capacity of the installed system though this could be defrayed by a low-interest, collateral-free loan.

Only houses with a suitable roof and an existing connection to the grid will be eligible for the scheme and consumers will still have to pay for all the net power supplied and consumed via the grid.

Ms. Sitharaman said the scheme has so far generated a “remarkable response” with more than 1.28 crore registrations and 14 lakh applications.

The Minister underlined investment in constructing small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), a proposal India has been considering for a few years. “Nuclear energy is expected to form a very significant part of the energy mix for Viksit (developed) Bharat. Towards that pursuit, our government will partner with the private sector for setting up Bharat Small Reactors, research and development of Bharat Small Modular Reactor, and research and development of newer technologies for nuclear energy. The R&D funding announced in the interim budget will be made available for this sector,” she said.

SMRs, as the name suggests, are compact versions of nuclear reactors and provide up to 300MW of power. In 2022, Atomic Energy Minister Jitendra Singh had said that these reactors, “less expensive and safer”, would be important to India’s energy security.

The Finance Minister also restated a proposal from 2018 to develop an advanced ultra supercritical (AUSC) thermal power plant via a collaboration involving the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL). However, no specific budgetary allocations were mentioned.

Supercritical plants vapourise water by heating it to a minimum of 300 degrees Celsius and pressurising it to 220 bars. This state, when used to run a turbine for electricity, burns coal more efficiently than in conventional plants. Ultra and advanced supercritical technology is a variation of this and while energy efficient, it requires sustained long-term investment.

In 2018, the government had officially announced that India’s first AUSC-based technology developed by the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research and manufactured by the BHEL for NTPC would be set up at the Sipat station in Chhattisgarh.

A policy for promoting pumped storage projects would be brought out for electricity storage and facilitating smooth integration of the growing share of renewable energy, the Ms. Sitharaman said. Pumped storage is a kind of hydroelectric power project in which water is stored at two different elevations, released and pumped back in a coordinated manner to run an electric turbine.

“This year’s budget has a lot in store for the energy sector. It is in line with the interim budget and with major investments in renewable energy will give a shot in the arm to clean energy companies. It underscores a move towards more holistic energy transition pathway, considering energy security, economic growth, employment generation, and environmental sustainability,” said Neshwin Rodrigues, electricity policy analyst, Ember-India, said in a statement. “India now needs to find ways to reduce reliance on thermal power and with battery costs expected to further fall sharply in the coming years, can plan phasing down this reliance,” he said.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-fillip-to-clean-energy-schemes/article68436882.ece

This is Ms. Sitharaman’s record seventh time making a budget speech. It also the first Budget presented by the third NDA government after winning the Lok Sabha elections.



Ms. Sitharaman said that the budgetary allocation signalled the government’s commitment to enhancing women‘s role in economic development.

To encourage participation of women in the workforce, the government will tie up with industry to set up working women hostels as well as creche-facilities, she said. Further, this industry-government partnership is also expected to launch women-specific skilling programmes and promote market access to women-led SHG enterprises.

As far as social justice is concerned, the government proposes adopting a saturation approach to cover all eligible people through various schemes, including those for health and education. The end goal is to achieve inclusive human resource development, one of the core priorities of the Union Budget 2024-25.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Nirmala Sitharaman signals shift from earlier trickle-down strategy to a slew of schemes,"Presenting her seventh Union Budget and the first after this year’s Lok Sabha election, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23 unveiled a flurry of measures aimed at fixing the woes of unemployed youth, small businesses, and the middle class, and sought to strengthen the ruling NDA coalition’s bonds with support for multiple investment projects in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.

Ms. Sitharaman proposed income tax rate cuts worth up to ₹17,500 a year, putting an extra ₹1,458 a month in the hands of those earning upto ₹12 lakh a year, and hiked standard deductions for salaried taxpayers and pensioners by ₹25,000 and ₹10,000, respectively. She also promised to spend ₹2 lakh crore over five years on five schemes which are part of what she called “the Prime Minister’s package”, aimed at spurring jobs and imparting skills to 4.1 crore youth.

Changing lanes

This marked a shift in strategy, or rather a frenetic changing of lanes ahead of a roundabout as drivers in the capital are prone to do, from the previous government’s preferred reliance on letting multiplier and trickle-down effects work while avoiding direct handouts to such sections of society. A similar lane change was last seen when Ms. Sitharaman’s predecessor, the late Arun Jaitley, presented his third Budget, for 2016-17.

Seeking to shed the “suit-boot sarkar” label used by the Opposition at the time, Mr. Jaitley had dedicated that Budget to the farmers, the poor, and vulnerable sections of society and switched his focus to the rural economy and job creation. The trigger for the shift, this time, could be the BJP’s electoral reverses after a decade of outright majority in Parliament, preceded by revelations such as big businesses’ electoral bond purchases.

Jobs, jobs, jobs

At a briefing after her roughly-90 minute speech, which appeared to acknowledge and begin addressing the perceived disenchantment among specific voter groups like the young, the salaried class, farmers, and small entrepreneurs, Ms. Sitharaman made it clear that the overarching theme of Budget 2024-25 was ‘EMPLOYMENT’. Used as an acronym, the theme was spelt out — Employment and Education; Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); Productivity; Land; Opportunities; Youth; Middle Class; Energy Security; New Generation Reforms; and Technology.

Her speech referred to ‘employment’ 23 times, up sharply from three mentions of the word in the 2023-24 Budget, and seven (four of which were about past achievements rather than the future) in the Interim Budget presented this February. ‘Jobs’ featured four times in relation to new schemes, compared with just one mention in the pre-poll Interim Budget. Similarly, there were three references to the middle-class, from just one mention in the Interim Budget and two in 2023-24.

Shift in priorities

References to growth slipped to 10, from a combined 34 mentions in the last two Budget speeches. Mr. Jaitley’s third Budget had also slashed growth references, but the similarities with that speech don’t end there. While he had released a plan to ‘Transform India’ based on action points around nine pillars, Ms. Sitharaman on Tuesday laid out nine priorities for generating ample opportunities for all. Five of those are, in fact, similar to Mr. Jaitley’s list that led with the promise to double farmers’ incomes in five years. Ms. Sitharaman said that her first priority would be to raise productivity and resilience in agriculture, followed by employment and skilling, inclusive human resource development and social justice.

Infrastructure and next generation reforms also figure in the priorities, with the Minister promising more details about the latter through an economic policy framework to be formulated later, with a focus on fixing factors of productivity, including land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship. She also announced a review of the Income Tax and Customs Acts, a simplification of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms, and a financial sector vision document for five years.

Fiscal consolidation

While investors will need to wait for those details, the Finance Minister did provide some indirect support to private investments by accelerating the fiscal consolidation process, armed with a ₹2.1 lakh crore surprise dividend from the central bank. The fiscal deficit target for this year has been pegged at 4.9% of GDP from the 5.1% projected in the Interim Budget, and the 5.6% of GDP achieved last year. A reduction in the government’s market borrowings would facilitate a reduction in policy interest rates and encourage private investment, EY’s chief policy advisor D.K. Srivastava pointed out.

Among the PM’s employment package schemes is a plan to provide one year internships in 500 top companies to one crore youth over five years. It is not clear if this will subsume the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0 that was announced in the last Budget to “skill lakhs of youth within the next three years” with an on-the-job training component.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Centre reduces customs duty on inputs for textile and leather industries,"There will be no duty on wet white, crust, and finished leather for manufacture of garments, footwear and other leather products for exports, down from the current 10%.

The Union Budget presented on Tuesday has proposed reduction of customs duty for some items in the textile and leather sector.

The import duty on “Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate” (MDI) will be reduced to 5% from the current 7.5% to “rectify inversion in duty”. The Finance Minister said, “To enhance the competitiveness of exports in the leather and textile sectors, I propose to reduce BCD on real down filling material from duck or goose. I am also making additions to the list of exempted goods for manufacture of leather and textile garments, footwear and other leather articles for export.”

There will be no duty on wet white, crust, and finished leather for manufacture of garments, footwear and other leather products for exports, down from the current 10%. Duty on some additional accessories for manufacture of textile and leather garments, leather and synthetic footwear or other leather products for exports will also be removed, and the real down filling material from duck or goose for use in manufacture of garments for exports will be 10% from the current 30%.

The budget also plans to introduce new tariff lines for technical textiles.

Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council said expanding the list of trims and embellishment under Import of Goods at Concessional Rate of Duty (IGCR) will help export of readymade garments.

According to Sanjay K. Jain, chairman of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, National Textiles Committee, the budgetary allocation for the textile sector has been raised by almost ₹900 crores to ₹4,300 crores. This will, hopefully, give continuity to the ongoing schemes.

Chairman of Confederation of Indian Textile Industry Rakesh Mehra said the stagnation in the textile and apparel industry should be addressed with some bold measures for capacity building, modernisation and cost competitiveness.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: What is taxonomy for climate finance?,"The story so far: The 2024 Union Budget, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday, includes developing a taxonomy for climate finance to enhance the availability of capital for climate adaptation and mitigation.

“This will support achievement of the country’s climate commitments and green transition,” Ms. Sitharaman said in her speech.

What is taxonomy for climate finance?

Climate finance taxonomy refers to a set of standardised regulations and guidelines to inform companies and investors on making impactful investments towards environmental conservation and combating the climate crisis.

The term taxonomy originally comes from the field of biology. It is the scientific method of naming and classifying organisms, including plants, animals, and microorganisms.

According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, “diverse interpretations fragment markets and confuse investors. What seems ‘green’ in one country may appear ‘brown’ elsewhere, stalling environmental progress,”

Taxonomies for sustainable climate financing, in general, include a detailed list of economic sectors and activities and corresponding criteria that determine if it aligns with larger climate goals.

“There are two dimensions to a taxonomy: the system itself in all its complexity, and the final product (boiled down to its pragmatic essentials) as it will be used by financial market participants and other users. Users of taxonomies and definitions are not necessarily interested in understanding why a given metric or threshold must be used for an activity. Rather, they will use the taxonomies and definitions as a final product and screen activities to determine eligibility under the taxonomy,” according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).



Climate finance taxonomies are known as ‘green’ taxonomies.

Why is climate finance taxonomy important?

Climate financing forms a core area of combating the climate crisis. According to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC’s) first ‘Needs Determination Report’, financing of around $5.8-5.9 trillion is required to implement developing countries’ climate action plans by 2030, and this does not fully include adaptation costs.

Climate finance taxonomies can facilitate financing for investors, credit institutions etc. based on how climate-aligned an entity or an activity is. It can therefore direct financial resources towards projects that support climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Green taxonomies help investors compare investment opportunities and measure their environmental impact. A localised climate finance taxonomy can also help align a country’s climate goals with the Paris Agreement and other international climate commitments while accounting for regional factors that influence localised transition pathways.

For example, different regions will have to adopt different pathways to reach the goal of limiting global warming to under 1.5 degrees C, as required under the Paris Agreement. A one-size-fits-all approach won’t work here, and where localised taxonomies on climate finance can help. Science-based targets at the regional level can help define metrics, based on which experts can develop standards and investors can determine their financial commitments, all without compromising on global climate goals.

Climate finance taxonomies can also help prevent greenwashing by companies by setting common standards based on scientific assessments.

“The development of a taxonomy for climate finance is crucial for establishing clear standards. It ensures that investments are transparently and efficiently directed towards genuine green projects, driving innovation and supporting India’s ambitious climate goals,” Harjeet Singh, Global Engagement Director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, told The Hindu.

Many countries like China, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka have already issued green taxonomies to facilitate climate-sensitive investments.

Editorial | Towards a green growth: On the RBI and a green taxonomy

What has India done to set up a green taxonomy?

In January 2021, India established a task force on sustainable finance under the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, to create a framework for sustainable finance in India, establish the pillars for a sustainable finance roadmap, suggest draft taxonomy of sustainable activities, and create a framework of risk assessment by the financial sector.

In April that year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) joined the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) as a member. RBI is also a member of a task force on climate-related financial risks set up by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance.

Why does India need a green taxonomy?

According to the IFC, India needs an estimated $10.1 trillion to achieve net-zero by 2070. Public investments alone can’t match this goal, which calls for standardisation in investments.

“A green taxonomy framework could significantly help India attract both domestic and international investments, aligning these funds with its national and global commitments to a green transition and enhanced climate resilience,” Mr. Singh said.

“Investors and industry have been demanding a taxonomy and transition pathway as guidance for flow of finance and reorientation of economic activity. The Budget announcements that clearly mention the establishment of a carbon market, taxonomy and transition pathways mark significant progress in planning towards net zero in 2070,” Suranjali Tandon, an associate professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-what-is-taxonomy-for-climate-finance-explained/article68437217.ece

This would account for 3.4% of the GDP. Enumerating it as among the policy prerogatives towards investment in infrastructure by central government, she told the house that the significant investments made in previous years have triggered a multiplier effect.



Ms Sitharaman elaborated that the endeavour is to provide strong fiscal support towards infrastructure in the next years in conjunction with other priorities and fiscal consolidation. She further urged, “We will encourage states to provide support of similar scale for infrastructure development based on their priorities.”

The finance minister stated that private investment in infrastructure will be promoted through Viability Gap Funding and a market-based financing framework would be brought out. Chief Economic Advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran writing in the Economic Survey tabled on Monday had held that for India to build quality infrastructure, a higher level of private sector financing and resource mobilisation would be crucial. “Facilitating this would not only require policy and institutional support from the Central Government, but State and Local Governments would have to play an equally important role,” the Economic Survey author stated.

Rama Rao has stated that Telangana has received a “big zero” this time too in the Union Budget 2024, as the Centre has been doing it for the last 10 years.

Reacting to the Budget presented in the Parliament by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday, he said: “We hoped that the daughter-in-law of Telugu States would allocate significant funds to Telangana in the budget. But what we got is nothing. It is disappointing that Telangana has not found even a mention in her entire budget speech”.



He stated that then Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had requested the Centre in the past to take decisions on nearly 35 promises made in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Several letters were written and appeals were made personally, whenever there was an opportunity. But, there was no mention of additional funds for Mulugu University, setting up the Bayyaram Steel Factory and Railway Coach Factory at Kazipet.

Despite the Telangana Government’s requests, national status had not been granted to any irrigation projects in the State and there was no response even for pleas made for national institutes such as IIM, for industrial corridors from Mumbai-Nagpur-Hyderabad, Hyderabad-Bengaluru and Hyderabad-Chennai. Even the request for the establishment of a new handloom cluster along with a mega power loom cluster, was overlooked, he said.

The requests made by Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy and other Ministers from Telangana too were ignored. Asking the people of Telangana to think about the result of giving eight Lok Sabha seats each to Congress and BJP, he reiterated that a separate political identity with a regional party for the State would protect the State’s interests. He cited the examples of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, which were given ample funds.

Mr. Rama Rao said BJP and Congress MPs sat in Parliament withoututtering a word on behalf of Telangana. Had there been MPs from BRS, they would have strongly opposed the injustice meted out to the State for 11 years, he said.

However, the picture brightens up if their continuing under-utilisation is taken into account.

The Department of Science and Technology (DST) received ₹8,029 crore, a marginal increase over the ₹7,931 crore from last year, but nearly two-thirds more than its utilisation of ₹4,891.78 crore.

Revenue expenditure under other scientific research accounts for the bulk of these numbers. The allocation for the National Quantum Mission jumped from zero last year to ₹427 crore this year. This Mission “aims to seed, nurture, and scale up scientific and industrial R&D and create a vibrant and innovative ecosystem in quantum technologies”. The Union Cabinet approved it in April 2023 with a total outlay of ₹6,000 crore over eight years.

The allocation for the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has been cut from ₹2,683.86 crore to ₹2,275.7 crore this year, yet it had more than ₹1,000 crore in unspent funds last year. Notably, its allocation under biotechnology R&D has dropped from ₹1,345 crore last year to ₹1,100 crore this year and under ‘other scientific research’ from ₹2,472.97 crore to ₹2,087.26 crore this year as against a utilisation last year of ₹1,508.07 crore.

The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), which oversees the more than three dozen DSIR laboratories around the country, tells a different story. It overspent its allocation last year by 8% but has received only a 2% hike over that. The hike brings its allocation this year to ₹6,323.41 crore.

The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has been given ₹3,064.80 crore — a modest increase over its actual expenditure of ₹2,879.02 crore last year but a 7.6% cut from the budgeted value. The capital outlay on oceanographic research has increased by ₹53 crore to ₹280 crore whereas that for meteorology has dropped by ₹168 crore to ₹276.20 crore. Among other activities, the MoES is currently piloting the ‘Deep Ocean Mission’, to develop vehicles to explore the ocean, prospect for resources, and develop technologies to mine them. The Union Cabinet approved it in 2022 at a cost of ₹4,000 crore.

Last year, following an unprecedented monsoon rain spell that triggered several incidents of flash floods and landslides, the State government had to declare the State as a ‘natural calamity affected area’. Ms. Sitharaman, presenting the Union Budget 2024-25, acknowledged the State’s losses and said, “Our government will provide assistance to the State for reconstruction and rehabilitation through multilateral development assistance.”

Hitting out at the BJP, Mr. Sukhu — in Shimla — said that the Centre had again disappointed Himachal Pradesh by ignoring its long pending demands and the aspirations of its people.

“Himachal government had requested the Centre to release ₹9,042 crore as financial assistance following a post-disaster assessment carried out by a Central team,” he noted. Knowing well that Himachal suffered enormously during last year’s disaster, the Budget offered only assurances and promises but nothing concrete in its relief package, he charged.

He also pointed out that a ‘special grant’ for Himachal had been denied despite strong recommendations in its favour.

Terming the budget “inequitable”, Mr. Sukhu highlighted several key areas of concern and called for immediate revisions to address the needs of the wider population of the State.

The State had repeatedly raised its demands for financial assistance for road, air and rail connectivity but it was unfortunate that none of them had been given any attention, he added.

The Budget failed to address the issue of expansion of the rail network in the State, financial assistance for the industrial sector and various tourism activities, the Chief Minister said.

thehindu.com,"Budget 2024: West Bengal deprived, Budget politically biased says Mamata","Alleging that West Bengal has been deprived in the Budget presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the State’s Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on July 23 dubbed it as a “politically biased Budget”.

“It is an anti-poor, anti-people, and politically biased Budget,” Ms. Banerjee told journalists in her chamber in the State Assembly. The Trinamool Congress chairperson accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government of “being envious of West Bengal” and said that the State received a “big zero” in the budgetary allocations.



“This budget is totally directionless, anti-people, with no vision, only a political mission in mind. I don’t see any light. It is dark, dark, and dark,” Ms. Banerjee said.

The Chief Minister raised questions on Centre’s proposal to provide flood assistance to neighbouring Sikkim. In her Budget speech, Ms. Sitharaman referred to devastating flash floods and landslides that wreaked havoc in Sikkim and added that the government will provide assistance to the State. ”If Sikkim gets and West Bengal is deprived. This is not good,” the Chief Minister said. She said that people of Darjeeling and Kalimpong should bear this in mind that while seeking votes the BJP promises everything but does not deliver. The BJP had won most of seats in north Bengal including Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat.

In her Budget speech the Finance Minister referred to the Amritsar Kolkata Industrial Corridor, and said the government will support development of an industrial node at Gaya. The Chief Minister said she had made provisions for the Dankuni Amritsar corridor long ago in 2009 and what the Finance Minister was promising was old wine in a new bottle.

Along with the Chief Minister, party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee reacted to the Budget saying that instead of tackling urgent issues like unemployment, rising prices and growing inflation, the “BJP has crafted a budget to bribe its coalition partners and buy time before the government implodes”. Mr. Banerjee also highlighted that Bengal has been constantly deprived by this BJP government at the Centre. “Has there been a positive outcome of 12 BJP MPs who are elected from Bengal? No! The net result is zero because Bengal has been constantly tortured & deprived. What Suvendu Adhikari said a few days ago Jo humare saath, hum unke saath [We are with those who are with us] has been proved today,” he said.



The Finance Minister in the Budget also referred to West Bengal while stressing on a plan, Purvodaya, “for the all-round development of the eastern region of the country covering Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh”.

TMC’s Rajya Sabha MP Sagarika Ghose spoke on similar lines and said they staged a walkout from the Upper House of Parliament in protest.

“This is a failed budget. It is to bribe two of the alliance partners - Bihar and Andhra Pradesh - not a Union Budget. This budget is bribing coalition partners before this government implodes,” she told reporters outside Parliament.

“We in the TMC have protested against this anti-Bengal budget. The TMC walked out of the Rajya Sabha. This is anti-federal. You cannot sacrifice the federal spirit at the alter of politics. It is ethically repugnant, constitutionally immoral and economically ruinous,” Ghose said.

Rajya Sabha MP Saket Gokhale alleged that there is an “open and shameless” discrimination against West Bengal in the budget.

“Open and shameless discrimination yet again in this Union Budget. Union Govt excludes only Bengal from flood relief and reconstruction funds,” he said in a post on X.

“Giving funds to other states while intentionally ignoring and singling out the people of Bengal is yet another revenge for BJP’s pathetic performance in elections,” Gokhale added.



“West Bengal contributes significant revenues to the Union but faces pathetic targeting and exclusion yet again in the Union Budget,” the TMC leader said.

Another Rajya Sabha MP of the party, Sushmita Dev, said central funds amounting to Rs 1.6 lakh crore are due to West Bengal and questioned how the budget exercise was being carried out without the census being held.

“You are calling the budget historic, but he is a king who does not know what the population is. There has been no census since 2011. If you do not know the exact numbers, how are you going to make the budget?” she asked.

Budget not for people, but to please BJP’s allies

Mr. Reddy said that the budget was politically motivated and drafted not for the people but to please Bharat Janata Party’s (BJP) allies: Janata Dal (U) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). While Bihar was given financial aid of ₹41,000 crore, Andhra Pradesh got ₹15,000 crore and other sops, including funds for completion of the Polavaram project. Congress-ruled States, especially Telangana, were totally neglected, he said.

“This is the 11th budget after the formation of Telangana in 2014. However, the new State remained neglected by the Centre. For the first time since 2014, a separate chapter titled ‘Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act’ was incorporated in the budget speech, but the Finance Minister did not mention the word ‘Telangana’ in her entire speech of 58 pages and 14,692 words,” he said.

Budget 2024 LIVE Updates

Telangana ministers submitted various applications in the last seven months seeking funds

The Minister condemned Ms. Sitharaman for completely skipping the mention of Telangana when she spoke about the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act in her budget speech. “While we are not against the Centre giving special funds to Andhra Pradesh, we strongly condemn its discrimination towards Telangana. Led by Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy, a delegation of Telangana ministers submitted various applications to all ministries in the last seven months seeking funds for various projects. But our pleas were completely ignored. The BJP Government promised to fund the Polavaram project, but gave no assurance in her budget speech today of giving funds for Palamuru Ranga Lift Irrigation Scheme,” he said.

“We are still hopeful that the BJP Government at the Centre will provide the funds for the Palamuru Ranga Reddy Project as assured to us by the then Union Water Resources Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat,” he said.

He ridiculed the Finance Minister’s claim that the BJP Government was making ‘concerted efforts to fulfil the commitments in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act’. “People of Telangana have been waiting for the last ten years for the BJP Government to honour the promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act. The Railway Coach Factory in Kazipet, a steel factory at Bayyaram, funds for Tribal University, funds for high-speed road and rail connectivity, and other promises made in the Act remained unfulfilled.

“If Bihar and Andhra Pradesh deserved special funds, then why is Telangana being deprived of such treatment?” he asked.

No mention of backward regions in Telangana

Uttam Kumar Reddy said that the Finance Minister selectively sanctioned grants for the backward regions of Rayalaseema, Prakasam, and North Coastal Andhra but decided to skip the mention of the backward regions of Telangana. “While we welcome the Finance Minister’s announcement that commitments made in the AP Reorganisation Act will be fulfilled, we expect that commitments made with both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are fulfilled,” he said.

He said eight BJP MPs, including two Union Ministers - G Kishan Reddy and Bandi Sanjay - failed to get a decent share for Telangana in the Union Budget.

He said that the Union Budget was highly disappointing for Telangana as it deprived the State of its share in resources and welfare schemes.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-not-a-word-of-telangana-says-irrigation-minister-uttam-kumar-reddy/article68436403.ece

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Kerala’s dream of AIIMS-like institution dashed again,"Kerala’s much-anticipated and decades-long dream of having an All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-like institution on its soil was dashed yet again when the proposal found no mention in the Union Budget 2024-25 presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23.



Unlike in the previous years, the anticipation this year that the project might finally come through was intense, particularly because of the presence of two Union Ministers of State from Kerala at the Centre, one of whom is the BJP’s first-ever elected MP from the State.

On July 22 too, the topic of approving an AIIMS-like institution for Kerala had been raised in Rajya Sabha by John Brittas, MP.

However, not just AIIMS, no major proposals for the nation’s health sector seemed to figure in the Union Budget 2024-25, other than the exemption of three more cancer drugs from customs duties.

The total allocation for the nation’s health sector in the Budget is ₹89,287 crore. The Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana has an allocation of ₹7,500 crore and the health coverage under the scheme has been extended to accredited social health activists (ASHA), anganwadi workers and helpers.

AIIMS was established as an autonomous institution in New Delhi under the Act of Parliament in 1956 and is today the apex medical institution in the country.

It is only after 2012 that the Centre began setting up AIIMS-like institutions across the country, under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY), a scheme announced in 2003, with the objectives of correcting regional imbalances in the availability of affordable/reliable tertiary healthcare services as well as augmenting facilities for quality medical education in the country.

There are today 22 AIIMS-like institutions in the country, some of which are operational, while the rest are in various phases of development.

A political and emotional issue

Over the past decade, having an AIIMS-like institution has become a political as well as emotional issue for Kerala and the feeling that the Centre was wilfully denying the State its due has been building.

The issue took on much political colour and was a much-debated topic of discussion in the State in the run up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections as well as the post-election debates, with many prominent MPs engaging in a war of words over “unfulfilled promises.”

While the State government seemed to have finalised Kinalur in Kozhikode as the ideal location to establish an AIIMS-like institution, Thiruvananthapuram, Palakkad and lately, Kasaragod have all been vying for the privilege.

Health Minister Veena George had informed the State Assembly in June that the Centre had accepted Kerala’s choice of Kinalur in Kozhikode to be the site for the proposed AIIMS-like institution but that the final approval on the project was still being awaited.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-keralas-dream-of-aiims-like-institution-dashed-again/article68436545.ece

Ms. Sitharaman announced that short-term capital gains on ""specified"" financial assets will henceforth attract a tax rate of 20% instead of 15%. While all other financial assets and non-financial assets shall continue to attract the ""applicable tax rate"".



Long-term gains on all financial and non-financial assets will attract a tax rate of 12.5% instead of 10%.

On the positive side, for the benefit of the lower and middle-income classes, it was proposed to increase the limit of exemption of capital gains on certain listed financial assets from ₹1 lakh to ₹1.25 lakh per year.

Listed financial assets held for more than a year is classified as long-term, while unlisted financial assets and all non-financial assets will have to be held for at least two years to be classified as long-term.

""Unlisted bonds and debentures, debt mutual funds and market-linked debentures, irrespective of the holding period, however, will attract tax on capital gains at applicable rates,"" Ms. Sitharaman said in her Budget speech.

All these proposals will come into force immediately.

Further, to bolster the Indian start-up eco-system, boost the entrepreneurial spirit and support innovation, Ms. Sitharaman proposed to abolish the so-called angel tax for all classes of investors.

This was a proposal from the industry for a long time, and this announcement will drive more investments towards startups in particular. Startups function as engines of economic growth, playing a crucial role in generating new jobs, ideas, products, and services.

The move to abolish the Angel Tax also drew rare praise from the opposition. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said "" was pleased to hear that the finance minister will abolish the Angel Tax. Congress has pleaded for the abolition for many years and most recently in the Congress Manifesto on page 31"".

As per definition, angel tax refers to the income tax levied by the government on funding raised by unlisted companies, or startups, if their valuation exceeds the company's fair market value. This contentious tax typically impacts angel investment the most and therefore is called the angel tax.

thehindu.com,"Budget 2024: BJD flays Centre, says Odisha’s ‘special status’ demand ignored","The Biju Janata Dal has lashed out at the Narendra Modi government accusing that Odisha’s demand for special category State status has been overlooked in the Union Budget while crores of funds have been allocated for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar.

Reacting to the Budget, former Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said, “BJP had put special category status in their manifesto as a promise to the people of Odisha. However, this promise has not been considered for Odisha, whereas special packages, allocating crores of funds have been announced for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar.”

“Along with this, the demand of Odisha for revision of coal royalty, which has been pending for years with the central government, has been rejected, because of which the State will lose thousands of crores of revenue every year,” Mr. Patnaik charged, terming the Budget disappointing.

In sync with the party’s stand, all the BJD MPs in Rajya Sabha walked out of House when the Union Budget was being laid.

“Before Walking out, the BJD MPs strongly said in the House that they were walking out due to the denial of Special Category State status to Odisha. While Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar had been asking for the special category, the two states got Special additional funds while Odisha’s demand was not considered,” said BJD MP and party spokesperson Sasmit Patra.

He sarcastically said probably this was the punishment meted out to Odisha for electing 20 Lok Sabha BJP MPs out of 21 MPs from Odisha.

“Lots of big promises in different sectors were made to the people of Odisha during the election campaign especially on agriculture , MSME and industry. There is no mention of any promise being fulfilled in this Budget. This is a complete neglect of Odisha and her people,” the BJD supremo maintained.

Mr. Patnaik further said, “We all know that Odisha faces a number of natural disasters every year, including floods. We had requested for a special package for disaster management. While similar requests of other States have been considered and they have been granted special packages for flood protection, the genuine demand of Odisha on disaster management has not been considered.”

The former CM pointed out, “we have been fighting for Justice in the Polavaram issue. Allocating more and more funds for Polavaram without sorting out the genuine grievances of Odisha shows impartiality against Odisha.”

On the expected line, the State unit of Bharatiya Janata Party welcomed the budget saying it was progressive and aimed at achieving goal of Vikshit Bharat.

Deputy Chief Minister K.V. Singh Deo said, “When a 24-year-old government did not take any step to improve the tourism sector, the Central government’s specific announcement for Odisha’s tourism development should be welcomed. It will generate employment.”

“Whatever special assistance is required for Odisha has been granted through different infrastructure projects and national programmes. Odisha has got more than its due share,” Mr. Singh Deo said. The State government would take up the issue of submergence of localities in its Malkangiri district due to Polavaram project of Andhra Pradesh, he said.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-bjd-flays-centre-says-odishas-special-status-demand-ignored/article68437720.ece
thehindu.com,Budget 2024 for Women: ₹3 lakh crore for schemes benefiting women and girls,"The first Union budget of the Modi 3.0 government saw a concerted effort at women-led development, with the Finance Minister announcing more than ₹3 lakh crore for schemes benefiting women and girls, and promised a look at further lowering duties for properties purchased by women.

She also announced a new pension scheme named ‘Vatsalya’. A contributory pension scheme, this will have contributions from parents and guardians. On the child attaining the age of majority, the plan can be converted seamlessly into a regular National Pension System (NPS) account.

Other announcements include the setting up of special working women’s hostels and creches in collaboration with industries to facilitate women’s employment, and promoting women-specific skilling programmes and support for women’s self help groups.

According to an analysis by The Hindu’s data team, the allocation for the Ministry of Women and Child Development has actually seen a dip, though very marginal, of 0.03%. While the budget estimate for FY25 is ₹26,092 crore, the revised estimate in FY24 was ₹25,448 crore.

The allocations for schemes coming under the Women and Child Development (WCD) Ministry, including ‘Samarthya’ (supporting projects such as women’s hostels), ‘Swadhar Greh’, and ‘Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana’, have also been increased slightly.

A significant portion of the WCD Ministry’s budget is directed towards Centrally-sponsored schemes, which received ₹25,848 crore.

The flagship schemes under the Ministry, including ‘Saksham Anganwadi’, POSHAN 2.0, Mission Vatsalya and Mission Shakti, have been given substantial funds to continue their efforts in improving nutrition, child protection, and women’s empowerment.

What activists really find encouraging though are the doubling of the upper limit of Mudra loans to ₹20 lakh to promote entrepreneurship in the country as, according to them, nearly 60% of entrepreneurs in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector are women, and they are desperately in need of formal loans.

The credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs is also likely to be benificial for women, they feel.

“The MSME sector has the maximum number of women who struggle to get collateral-free loans. These efforts made in the Union budget would be hugely beneficial to them as we have observed in our work with communities,” Kalpana Ajayan, regional head, South Asia, Women’s World Banking, and Member, Gender Committee, Reserve Bank Innovation Hub, said.

Ahead of the Budget, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin presented a wish list of projects for Tamil Nadu, including funds for the Chennai Metro Rail Phase 2, and an elevated expressway between Tambaram and Chengalpattu. At a pre-Budget meeting, State Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu had sought funds for flood relief. None of these found a mention in the Budget speech.

Tamil Nadu’s share of Central taxes is 4.079%, as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission. The amount has been revised upwards from ₹49,754.95 crore to ₹50,873.76 crore in the Union Budget.

The DMK government has pointed out that the State has been getting a much lower share of Central taxes due to the levy of cesses and surcharges. The State government has requested the Union government to merge the cesses and surcharges into the basic rates of taxation, saying the move would ensure that the States receive their legitimate share in devolution.

The announcement of five schemes and initiatives to facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities and support MSMEs would benefit Tamil Nadu, which is a highly industrialised State and has the highest number of factories.

Tamil Nadu is a top market for education loans, and the announcement of financial support for loans of up to ₹10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions is likely to benefit the State.

The announcement that the Centre will encourage States that charge a high stamp duty to moderate the rates for all, and also consider lowering the duties for properties purchased by women, if implemented, would benefit homebuyers in Tamil Nadu.

Tamil Nadu is also among the top States in terms of Mudra loans, and the announcement that the limit of the loans will be increased from ₹10 lakh to ₹20 lakh for entrepreneurs who have availed themselves of, and successfully repaid, previous loans under the ‘Tarun’ category would also benefit the State.

thehindu.com,"Budget 2024: JNU, DU hope for increased education funding to boost innovation, entrepreneurship","As the nation gears up for Budget 2024-25, the vice-chancellors of Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University expressed hope for increased investment in education to boost entrepreneurship, and innovation, and help the country become a knowledge power. Some experts in the education sector also urged the government to reduce the GST slab on educational products and services from 18% to 5%.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23. This is going to be the first Budget of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after they won the Lok Sabha Elections 2024.

Speaking to ANI ahead of the budget, Delhi University Vice Chancellor Yogesh Singh felt the need for more debates on investing in education. “There is always a need to invest more in education, there is no debate on that. We are very happy and waiting for the Union Budget. When it comes to the University of Delhi, we are getting adequate grants from the Government of India. Last year also we received adequate funding from the Government. There is always a need to invest more in education, there is no debate on that,” he said. “When we have taken a ‘Sankalp’ for Viksit Bharat by 2047, this will not happen without the active participation of higher education of our country,” he noted.

Echoing similar sentiments, JNU Vice-Chancellor Prof. Santishree Dhulipudi Pandit said, “To become a knowledge power, the investment in education has to grow. If the best education is given to all, it makes a huge difference on the impact and quality of graduates who can compete nationally and internationally.”

Other experts in the education sector urged the government to elevate the investment in education. The ed-tech sector anticipates increased funding and supportive policies that can drive significant advancements in educational technology. Aarul Malaviya, founder of Zamit (an AI-driven ed-tech platform) believes that this budget presents an opportunity to address these needs by allocating funds towards enhancing internet connectivity, providing modern devices, and ensuring that both teachers and students are well-equipped to leverage these technologies.

“We also hope to see initiatives that promote innovative learning technologies, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and personalised learning platforms,” Mr. Malaviya said.

Meanwhile, Praveen Singh, CEO at AASOKA by MBD Group (an innovative blended learning solution) called for transforming school and college systems. “However, to truly foster educational innovation and transformation, the government must increase the education sector’s budget and reduce the GST slab from 18% to 5% on educational products and services. This reduction will vastly improve access to affordable and high-quality education for all,” he added. He also said lowering the GST rate on upskilling programmes in the upcoming Union Budget will democratise access to quality education, fostering innovation and employability.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-jnu-du-hope-for-increased-education-funding/article68425132.ece
thehindu.com,Union Budget 2024: Kerala hopes for a better deal this time,"Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal on July 20 voiced Kerala’s expectations for a better deal in the Union Budget this time, expressing his hope that the changed political situation in the country would pressure the Centre to pay more attention to welfare-oriented measures.

Topping State’s wish-list is a ₹24,000 crore special economic package “to tide over the current liquidity stress by scheduling it over a period of 2 years from 2024-25.” Going over the wish-list ahead of Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget presentation on July 23 (Tuesday), Mr. Balagopal said the State government has not plucked the figure, ₹24,000 crore, out of the air. Rather, it is meant to fill the gap caused by the cuts in the State’s borrowing limit during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 fiscals, Mr. Balagopal added.

Mr. Balagopal had presented the State’s demands at the pre-Budget consultation held by Ms. Sitharaman in New Delhi June.

Among the State’s demands include a ₹5,000 crore ‘special assistance’ for the Vizhinjam international seaport project, and an unconditional permission to borrow ₹6,000 crore in the current fiscal in lieu of the money spent on loan acquisition by the State for National Highway development. Kerala had urged the Centre to treat the ₹5,580 crore spent by the State thus far as additional capital expenditure for national highway.

In the rail sector, Kerala has sought speedy clearance for the SilverLine semi-high speed rail project, surveys DPR preparation for the Thalassery-Mysuru and Nilambur-Nanjangud rail lines and more express and passenger trains.

Kerala has also reiterated its demand for an All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), and the Kannur International Ayurveda Research Institute. For the ailing rubber sector, the State has urged the Centre to raise the support price to ₹250 per kg.

“Our demand for an AIIMS is fully justified. Our request has been pending for 10 years. For a State like Kerala, an AIIMS should been sanctioned long ago,” he said.

On Saturday, Mr. Balagopal also drew attention to the large sums pending from the Centre towards health grant (₹725 crore), grants for local bodies (₹513 crore) and the National Health Mission (₹636 crore).",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/union-budget-2024-kerala-hopes-for-a-better-deal-this-time/article68425883.ece

Between 2004-05 period, the budget allocation was Rs 8000 crore.

In 2016-17, the Railways budget instead of being presented separately, under Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s time, was merged with General Budget, ending a 92-year old practice of being presented separately.

thehindu.com,"Union Budget 2024: NBFC sector seeks more funds to improve liquidity, regulatory reforms from Budget","Ahead of the upcoming Union Budget scheduled to be presented on July 23, the Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) sector is expecting enhanced financial inclusion and reinforcing digitalisation efforts to sustain the sector's growth.

Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC), which represents the industry, has suggested establishing a special refinancing body, just as the government has created National Housing Bank (NHB) for housing finance companies.

On the other hand, the sector this year has seen stringent regulatory action from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Additionally, speaking at an event in May this year, RBI Deputy governor J. Swaminathan cautioned the NBFCs not to be overly reliant on algo-based credit models. However, the apex bank, in its 29th Financial Stability Report (FSR) said that the NBFCs are well capitalised, giving an edge to the financial sector in the country.

As of the end of March 2024, NBFCs had a CRAR of 26.6%, a GNPA ratio of 4.0% and a return on assets (RoA) of 3.3%.

""The growth of the Indian NBFC industry is significantly influenced by robust financial inclusion, consumer demand and improving trade balances. The upcoming Union Budget should emphasise enhancing financial inclusion across the country, implementing policy reforms, and reinforcing digitalisation efforts to sustain the sector's growth.

Financial and digital inclusion will enhance credit access by increasing convenience and reducing turnaround times,"" said Rakesh Kaul, CEO, Clix Capital.

""The government must consider incentivising and promoting such measures so that NBFCs can carefully take advantage of global integration, ensuring sustainable growth and financial inclusion across India's diverse economic landscape,"" said Jitendra Tanwar, Managing Director & CEO of Namdev Finvest Private Limited.

He further added that the government must consider incentivising and promoting such measures so that NBFCs can carefully take advantage of global integration, ensuring sustainable growth and financial inclusion across India's diverse economic landscape.

Expressing his confidence in the Budget this year, Krishan Gopal, CFO, Aye Finance, said, “I believe this Budget will lay the groundwork for India’s vision of development by 2047. We expect the Government to recognise the efforts of NBFC lenders that are transforming micro-enterprise lending in India by providing customised credit lines, announcing schemes and subsidies and even considering classifying them as Priority Sector Lenders.”

“Despite strong competition from banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have shown remarkable resilience in retaining a significant market share. To drive further growth, we seek policies that promote responsible credit utilisation, enhance access to credit for underserved communities, and foster financial literacy among customers,” said Mathew Muthoottu, MD Muthoottu Mini Financiers Limited.

”NBFCs are expecting the Budget to carry provisions that spur consumption, such as via tax relief etc.; implement initiatives that enable growth of NBFCs serving priority sector clients; and undertake widespread campaigns aimed at inculcating good credit behaviour amongst the country’s growing borrower base,” opined Neha Juneja, Co-founder and CEO, IndiaP2P, on her Budget expectations.

Anticipating the allocation of additional funds for the sector, Pavitra Walvekar, the CEO of Kudos Finance, which is based out of Pune, said, “Key initiatives should include the allocation of additional funds to improve liquidity for NBFCs and the introduction of regulatory reforms to streamline operations and enhance transparency. These steps will bolster credit availability, particularly for underserved segments like MSMEs, and promote financial stability in the long run.”",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2024-nbfc-sector-seeks-more-funds-to-improve-liquidity/article68406124.ece

thehindu.com,"Union Budget 2024 Expectations: Keep increasing road-infra spending, frame policies to promote electrification","The growth of the automotive industry in India has happened because of the excellent road infrastructure which has been created during the last couple of years. A lot of intercity travel means that consumers want to have luxury cars, they want to have safer cars and that has helped to drive growth in the industry.

This time from the Union Budget we would expect not only continuity in infrastructure spending but also increased spending on road infrastructure because there exists a lot of head-room for improvement for the industry to grow.

For long-term success of electrification of automobiles, one of the big factors helping us, is the reduced duty structure that enables to price Electric Vehicles (EVs) close to Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) cars. Our expectation is the government comes out with a clear policy roadmap and gives a statement that these incentives on taxes will continue for the next 8 to 10 years.

This will give confidence to customers to get into EVs and also OEMs to invest more when it comes to electrification. OEMs like us would be interested in introducing new cars in the Indian market. In addition, there is also a pressing need for the State governments to continue their commitment towards EV adoption, continuing the tax breaks and incentives that attract end consumers.

For charging infrastructure the onus is on Charging Point Operators (CPOs) to set up the desired network to democratise their chargers. Today, we find that a lot of CPOs are not opening up their APIs so the customers need to download multiple apps to charge their cars.

To address this the government can come with a common platform for all CPOs to list, so that customers have the ease of payment like UPI to transact when it comes to charging their EVs. Apart from this, there are a lot of good ideas the world over to make it toll free for electric cars, providing special parking facility in cities for EVs. So, I think, no amount of incentives is less, because electrification needs a major push from the government.

As India aggressively transitions towards carbon neutrality, the government’s role also becomes more pronounced. We believe the road towards creating a carbon-neutral ecosystem will come from zero emission, which can be delivered by electrification. OEMs, their suppliers, vendors, policymakers and all other key stakeholders have to come together, work in close cooperation to ensure we create a robust, resilient and time-bound EV ecosystem.

At OEM level, the industry is ensuring that we actively encourage the EV adoption not just by launching high-tech and desirable product offerings, but we also focus on easing the total cost of ownership. This the OEMs are doing via offering long battery warranties, attractive residual value for EVs which are comparable to ICE vehicles and also extending service intervals to prolong any workshop visits.

The industry should continue to not only focus on introducing new products, but also spend their time and resources for enhancing consumer-education initiatives across markets. The actual acceleration for EV adoption can only happen when there is a strong demand from consumers for these technologies; but for that, we need concerted and coordinated efforts from OEMS, policymakers and customers.

When it comes to import duties, we have been in India for 30 years doing business based on the current taxation structure. Though lower taxes are always welcome, we also need to be pragmatic considering the current economic as well as political compulsions. So, we are realistic there, when it comes to tax cost. Hopefully, there are no increases as such in this Union Budget and there is continuity in taxation which should help us to do business as usual.

We expect the Indian auto industry to grow at 7% to 8% or maximum at 10% this year. The luxury car market size is 1 to 1.2% of the total industry and this segment should grow in double digit, may be slightly faster than the mass market passenger cars, because the base is low.

Right now, if you look at the enablers; the stock market is at all-time high, the real estate sector is doing well, tax collections are at a record high. So, we do not see any impediments to achieve the projected growth. With the incoming festive season combined with the wedding season and the depreciation month of September [a lot of consumers buy cars in September to claim depreciation benefits), I think the market will remain strong in the rest part of the year as well.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Insurers expect more tax benefits for health insurance in Union budget,"More tax benefits for health insurance under the new tax regime, relaxation in payment norms for MSMEs and incentives for the agri-tech sector are among the expectations of stakeholders from the first budget of the Modi 3.0 government.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the full Budget for fiscal 2024-25 on July 23, which will be the first major policy document of the new government.

Anup Rau, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Future Generali India Insurance Company, said the deduction limit on health insurance premiums under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act has remained unchanged for the past nine years despite the fact that there has been a significant rise in healthcare costs across the country.

""It would be best if the limit for medical insurance is linked to inflation and gets revised automatically every year or once in a couple of years. Also, the benefits need to be extended to the New Tax regime since increasing health insurance penetration is critical. So, we hope the upcoming Budget to announce some hike in the deduction limit on health insurance premiums,"" Rau said.

Tapan Singhel, MD & CEO of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said reforms like offering health insurance to employees at negotiated rates, reducing GST on health insurance premiums, and offering tax benefits like increased Section 80D exemption limits would make health insurance more affordable and accessible, especially for the 'missing middle' segment of our population.

""Additionally, for senior citizens, removing the limit on deductions for health insurance premiums would significantly ease their financial burden,"" Mr. Singhel said.

The Finance Minister is likely to lay out the government's economic agenda in the budget.

On expectations from the Ms. Sitharaman's budget, D S Negi, CEO of Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre (RGCIRC), said the focus on reforming cancer care in India is crucial and it is important to prioritise funding for advanced treatments like immunotherapy and personalised medicine, ensuring more patients can access these cutting-edge therapies.

""Extending Ayushman Bharat to those aged above 70 years will be highly beneficial for senior citizens. However, the current coverage limit of ₹5 lakh may not be sufficient for critical illnesses such as cancer, where treatment costs can range from ₹15-20 lakh.

""Therefore, it is essential to consider increasing the coverage limit for critical illnesses like cancer to ensure adequate financial support for cancer patients,"" Mr. Negi added.

The budget is likely to include steps to fast-rack reforms to make India a USD 5-trillion economy in the near future and turn the country into a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047.

Ahead of the budget, Chairman of the Medical Technology Association of India (MTaI) Pavan Choudary said that customs duties and taxes levied on medical devices in India are one of the highest in the world which directly impacts patient affordability.

""On the other hand, countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, Italy, and Norway impose no such duties. Australia and Japan levy only a minimal 0.5 per cent duty, while in the United States, it stands at 2 per cent, and in China at 3 per cent.

""This stark contrast creates risk for illegal imports of medical devices in India that are not backed by legal and service guarantees. Furthermore, such trade would undercut the Indian government's tariff revenue,"" he said.

Vivek Jalan, Partner at Tax Connect Advisory Services LLP, said as per recommendations of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Section 43B(h) in the Income Tax Act was introduced from AY 24-25. However, the alignment of the disallowance for payables under sections 43B(h) of the Act has been made with the MSME Act, which requires that payment has to be made to an SME within a maximum of 45 days.

""This is difficult in the present-day trade where a 60-90 days credit period is the norm.

""In this budget, it is expected that this provision will be relaxed/amended aligning the same with the CGST Act w.r.t. disallowance when payment to SMEs is not made within 180 days. Hence, in case a taxpayer does not pay an SME within 180 days, then the expense may be added back to his income,"" he said.

In anticipation of the budget, Saurabh Rai, CEO of Arahas, has expressed high expectations for substantial investments in sustainability and geospatial technology.

""We anticipate significant allocations towards renewable energy projects and incentives for companies embracing green technologies,"" he said.

Additionally, Rai said that boosting agri-tech innovations, providing tax incentives for tech companies and investing in human capital development is imperative for driving sustainable growth.

Sanjay Kumar, Founder and CEO of Geospatial World, said that to fully leverage the power of digital twin technology, it is crucial to allocate dedicated funds to it in the Union Budget.

""This allocation will facilitate the widespread adoption of digital twins, driving efficiency gains, cost savings, and improved decision-making in infrastructure projects. By investing in this technology, India can achieve significant long-term benefits, such as enhanced asset management, reduced downtime, and increased resilience to environmental challenges,"" Mr. Kumar said.

thehindu.com,"Budget 2024: Pharma industry seeks tax benefits, effective intellectual property rights regime","There is a need to incentivise R&D investments, offer corporate tax concessions and establish an effective intellectual property rights regime in order to push the growth of domestic pharmaceutical industry, as per the industry bodies.

Outlining the sector's wish list for the upcoming Union Budget, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) Director General Anil Matai urged the government to explore methods to incentivise R&D investments, such as deductions on R&D expenses, research-linked incentives for MNCs, and corporate tax concessions.

The initiatives will help in accelerating R&D and innovation in the sector, he added.

""Recognising the high-risk, long-gestation nature of R&D, we suggest extending the scope of section 115BAB of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to companies solely engaged in pharmaceutical research and development and providing a 200 per cent deduction rate on R&D expenditures,"" Matai said.

This would significantly boost the sector's ability to undertake essential research and development, including clinical trials and patent registration, he added.

Matai also sought establishing an effective intellectual property rights regime for driving growth and encouraging research-based pharma companies, both global and domestic, to introduce innovative therapies in India towards addressing unmet medical needs.

Besides, he sought introduction of incentives for centres and companies that provide specialised training programmes for pharmaceutical employees.

""Incentives for developing treatments for rare diseases are also crucial,"" Matai said.

Besides, enhancing the management of rare diseases through more centres of excellence (CoEs), increased budget allocations for incentivising R&D on therapies for rare disease, and import duty waivers are essential, he noted.

""Expanding the list of life-saving drugs eligible for GST/import duty exemptions, including all oncology medications, will further improve patient affordability,"" Matai said.

In order to attract investment and contribute to a more resilient and future-ready pharmaceutical industry, the government should provide incentives for investments in bonds issued by pharmaceutical companies, he added.

OPPI represents the research-based pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Novartis and Merck, in India.

Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) Secretary General Sudarshan Jain said the policy direction should leverage the industry's knowledge-driven foundation and the status as a global manufacturing hub.

The thrust should be on quality and innovation, he stated.

Given the high risk, lengthy development periods, and low success rates in research, continuous investment is crucial, he added.

""The 2024-25 budget should introduce policies that provide direct and indirect tax benefits to encourage research and investment in becoming a global benchmark in quality,"" Jain said.

thehindu.com,Union Budget 2024: Real estate’s wishlist,"The Indian real estate sector is a crucible of economic growth and employment. The sector stands at a crossroads as the government prepares to present its Union Budget in July. Though it has massive potential, the Indian housing industry still faces numerous hurdles.

To generate more growth and address the housing needs of a growing population, particularly in the low and mid-income segments, the Budget must include tax breaks, regulatory reforms, and financial assistance measures.

Affordable and mid-income housing is the foundation of the real estate industry, meeting the urgent housing needs of the enormous low-income group and middle-class population. To significantly boost this section, the following strategies are critical:

Interest subsidies and housing loans

Raising the interest subsidy for housing loans is the need of the hour. Doing this will make homeownership more affordable. Reducing interest rates will also lower the financial stress on aspiring homebuyers. The government should seriously think about widening the scope of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).

Enhanced Credit-Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS)

Extending and improving CLSS can provide financial relief to mid-income homebuyers. Both the income eligibility threshold and subsidy amount should be raised.

Single-window clearance

A single-window clearance system for budget home projects will help considerably to make the complex approval process more streamlined and simple. This, in turn, would help to decrease delays in possession of such units and reduce the overall costs.

Tax breaks

To lighten the load and make homeownership approachable, tax breaks come handy. They can also encourage builders to take on new affordable housing projects.

Raising the tax deduction limit under Section 24(b) of the IT Act is long overdue. The deduction limit should be increased from the current ₹2 lakh to at least ₹3 lakh or even more.

Reduce stamp duty

The government can encourage state governments to cut their stamp duty rates, which account for a significant portion of the cost of homeownership. Even a temporary decrease or waiver of stamp duty on affordable and lower-middle-income housing can boost demand and sales.

Incentives for first-time buyers

First-time homebuyers should get further sentiment boosters. For instance, the government can raise the deduction limit under Sections 80EE and 80EEA for such buyers.

GST reforms for developers

GST rates applicable on construction materials and services can help lower overall project costs for builders. Also, a reduced GST rate for affordable housing projects would help attract more builders to this vital segment and to pursue such projects.

Apart from direct financial boosters, the Budget can introduce many policy initiatives, which will indirectly improve sentiment in the housing sector:

Fast-track infrastructure

The government is determined to develop infrastructure like roads and public transport such as metros and railways. This helps expand metropolitan areas and boosts affordable housing, which is usually developed in emerging areas where land is cheaper and infrastructure is still catching up. However, we need a much faster roll-out of such projects so that connectivity to such areas improves at a faster pace.

Land reforms

Simplifying the overall land acquisition process will help developers speed up their supply of new projects. There is an express need for an open and effective land records management system that reduces disputes and, therefore, project delays.

Better finance access

Developers always need access to financing, but smaller and medium-scale players are at a bigger disadvantage than big players. The Budget could consider announcing a separate real estate investment fund and also credit guarantees to such builders so that their cash flow improves.

Rental housing policy

Rental housing would benefit from favourable policies and tax incentives for those who cannot afford to buy homes. Implementing a model tenancy law and providing tax breaks on rental income would help a lot.

thehindu.com,T.N. Budget 2024-25: A tightrope walk amid financial constraints,"Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu will present the State Budget for 2024-25 on Monday, ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha election. Amid a tight financial situation, the Budget – to be presented with the theme ‘Crossing obstacles and marching towards growth’ – will be keenly watched to see whether the DMK government bats for fiscal prudence or populism.

On September 15, 2023, the government launched its flagship Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thittam, which grants ₹1,000 per month to over 1.15 crore women heads of families, fulfilling its poll promise. A key aspect of this Budget would be revenue augmentation to meet the expenditure for various schemes. Fiscal 2023-24 has been challenging for the State’s finances, owing to the heavy floods in Chennai and southern districts.



According to the Governor’s Address, the State was grappling with a severe stress on its fiscal resources in the aftermath of the disasters, and its capacity for resource mobilisation was constrained following the implementation of GST.

The State’s Own Tax Revenue (SOTR), which accounts for 78.9% of Tamil Nadu’s total revenue, was projected to be ₹1,81,182 crore in 2023-24, a growth of 20.61% from 2022-23, according to the budget estimates.

So far in 2023-24 (till December), the SOTR has been ₹1,09,708.78 crore, as per the provisional figures from the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG), which constitutes about 60% of the budget estimates.

Key components of SOTR include collection from State Goods and Services Tax (SGST), taxes on vehicles, revenue from Stamps and Registration Fees, VAT on petrol and diesel and liquor, The State Excise Duties (which reflect liquor revenue).The State is likely to fall short of its SOTR target for 2023-24, owing to impact of the floods. The State government had hiked excise duty on liquor sold by the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited (Tasmac) from February 1, which might offset the impact to an extent. It has also made a slew of changes in registration charges for flats.

Revenue receipts

Including the Share of Central Taxes (which is 4.079%), Tamil Nadu has estimated its total revenue receipts to be ₹2,70,515 crore for 2023-24. Up to December, the total revenue receipts stood at ₹1,72,980.84 crore. In the interim Union Budget, the amount that Tamil Nadu would get as its Share of Central Taxes has been revised to ₹44,760.83 crore from the initial estimates of ₹41,664.86 crore for 2023-24.

The DMK government has been pointing out that it continues to get a much lower share of Central taxes due to the indiscriminate levy of cesses and surcharges by the Centre.

For 2023-24, the State has estimated the revenue expenditure to be ₹3,08,056 crore. Till December, the revenue expenditure was ₹1,96,781.57 crore. Tamil Nadu government has incurred an expenditure of ₹2,028 crore towards flood relief in Chennai and surrounding areas and Southern districts.

Factoring in the expenditure on account of the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai Thittam, the State has projected a revenue deficit (when revenue expenditure exceeds revenue receipts) of ₹37,540 crore for 2023-24. Till December, the revenue deficit stands at ₹23,800.73 crore.As of December 31, 2023, the fiscal deficit stood at ₹55,066.54 crore. The government will attempt to manage the revenue deficit at the budgeted level of ₹37,540 crore in 2023-24 and strive to stay within the fiscal deficit target of 3.25% of the Gross State Domestic Product and manage the Debt to GSDP ratio within the prescribed limits through revenue augmentation and effective fiscal consolidation, Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu had said in the Assembly in October 2023.

So far, in fiscal 2023-24 (till December), the State government has borrowed ₹76,000 crore, according to the data available on the RBI website. It planned to borrow ₹37,000 crore in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023-24. Measures towards achieving the $1-trillion economy target will also be keenly watched. The State has also undertaken some reforms in the power sector by announcing a plan for annual power tariff hikes and formation of Tamil Nadu Green Energy Corporation Limited, to pursue its green energy ambitions.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-budget-2024-25-a-tightrope-walk-amid-financial-constraints/article67861123.ece
thehindu.com,Sops galore in West Bengal Budget 2024-25 ahead of Lok Sabha polls,"Ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls West Bengal government’s Budget for the 2024-25 had a slew of policies for social welfare and sops for every sector from women, government employees and contractual employees.

Minister of State (Independent Charge) Chandrima Bhattacharya tabled ₹3,66,166 crore Budget by doubling the monthly financial assistance under the ‘Lakhsmi Bhandar’ scheme, increasing the Dearness Allowance (DA) to government employees and hiking salaries of civic police volunteers .“The Centre has imposed a financial blockade on West Bengal. But, we will not cow down. The State’s dues from the central government is nearly ₹1.18 lakh crore,” Ms. Bhattacharya said.

The financial assistance under the ‘Lakshmir Bhandar’ scheme for the general category has been increased from ₹500 to ₹1000 per month and for SC/ST hiked from ₹1000 to ₹1200. This increased allocation will cost an additional ₹1200 crore to the State exchequer. The allocation for the flagship scheme with about 2.11 crore beneficiaries in the State for the year 2024-25 stands at a whopping ₹14,400 crore.

The State’s Finance Minister also announced an additional 4% dearness allowance (DA) for state government employees from May, in addition to the 4% that was declared in January 2024. Ms. Bhattacharya also added that her government introduced a ‘Gender and Child Budget Statement’ in this year’s Budget.



The West Bengal government has allocated ₹3,700 crores to pay the wages of 21 lakh MGNREGA workers as announced by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on February 3. Observing that the “Central government has deprived marginalised people of their minimum subsidence right by denying funds under MGNREGA‘,‘ the Budget referred to a new scheme ‘Kamrasree’ where the State government will ensure at least 50 day work to each job card holder. The Budget also promised that the West Bengal government also promised to provide employment to five lakh persons through several schemes.

The Budget allocated Rs 900 crore to Class XI students for purchasing tablets, smart phones for class XI students. The scheme ‘Taruner Swapno’ was introduced in 2022. The West Bengal government in the Budget for 2024-25 brought Migrant workers working outside the State under the Swasyatha Sathi scheme and introduced grants for new artisans, handlooms, and Khadi weavers. Under the Samudra Sathi scheme fishermen will be given ₹5000 a month for two months mid-April to mid-June when there is ban on fishing activities.

The Budget documents tabled in the State Assembly pointed out that the tax collection is expected at around ₹1,02,349 crore whereas the debt as a percentage of GSDP stood at 36.88% in 2024-25. The expenditure for capital outlay is pegged at ₹35,866 crore whereas revenue expenditure stands at ₹2,68,202 crore. The State government’s raising of public debt amounts to ₹1,21,689 crore.

Lauding the Budget, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that despite the financial constraints the Budget proves that West Bengal is marching ahead and showing the path for the rest of the country on how to make provisions in a Budget for the masses.

Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari described the Budget as ‘directionless’ and said that the document was an attempt to hold on to power and regain lost ground ahead of Lok Sabha polls.

The tabling of the Budget witnessed noisy scenes in the State Assembly with members of the Opposition benches disrupting the speech of the Finance Minister. As the proceedings of the State Assembly started the State Song’ Bangla Mati Bangla Jal’ was played. Mr. Adhikari and other BJP MLA started singing the national anthem at the same time. Speaker Biman Banerjee and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee condemn the behavior of the BJP legislators.

The Chief Minister said that the Assembly was not a “BJP office” and said that her MPs will not allow tabling of the Union Budget next time if the BJP legislators did not behave themselves. There was ruckus in the House and the BJP MLAs raised slogans whenever the State Finance Minister raised the issue of Centre denying funds to the State. Every new allocation and announcement in the Budget was cheered by members of the Treasury Benches.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/west-bengal-state-budget-2024/article67824908.ece
thehindu.com,Kerala Budget 2024-25/ ‘A Friendly Budget’,"Thomas Joseph K.

Kerala Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal presented a friendly Budget on Monday by not slapping any fresh taxes.

The announcement of ₹1,032 crore for public education will provide a much-needed fillip to the public education sector that has been seeing a revival during the past few years. It also provides an impetus to the overarching social sector development theme which has been the game-changer for Kerala for an even longer time. It is the right step in the right direction to take the world renowned ‘Kerala Model’ forward.

A model school in each district will work as a key factor in transforming the State’s education sector. The budgetary allocation of ₹155 crore to provide free uniform to schoolchildren is another announcement that needs appreciation. Above all, the allocation of ₹456 crore for paving the way for people’s contribution to strengthening the State’s higher education sector is another welcome announcement in the Budget. But we may have to see the final blueprint to understand how the idea will transform into solid policy action.

Additional funds for ‘Operation Breakthrough’ announced in the Budget to preclude recurrence of flash floods in Kochi and its adjoining localities will go a long way in supporting the vital infrastructure in the city, which incidentally is also the commercial hub of the State. The city has been battered by flash floods emanating from extreme climate events in recent times leading to massive economic losses.

Micro, small and medium enterprise or MSMEs, which form a sizable chunk of the State’s industrial population, have got a fair deal in the Budget with an allocation of ₹216 crore. This is expected to catalyse the sector, which employs thousands of people in the State. Cashew sector, one of the key export-oriented industries and a major source of employment for women workers, got a special allocation of ₹53 crore, which is commendable.

The Finance Minister also paid much-needed attention to the tourism sector by announcing incentives in areas such as eco-tourism. Also, the call for strengthening the tourism sector, which is one of the key revenue earning industries for the ecologically sensitive State, by ensuring increased people’s participation is another welcome move.

Such increased participation of people will make the hospitality sector more vibrant going forward. New themes such as zoological park and tiger safari park will add new colour and shade to the hospitality sector in the long run, moving in tandem with the Union Budget.

The Finance Minister has announced the development of sandalwood cultivation in the State, but how it will be achieved remains to be seen. Steps to protect people facing soil erosion in the coastal areas is another progressive move, especially when the State is facing high incidence of extreme climate events.

Even though the government has proposed an increase in stamp duty for lease agreements, overall, the Finance Minister has done a fine balancing act by sparing people from new taxes while stepping up efforts to enhance the economic activities by announcing a bevy of measures to increase people’s participation in key economic activities. To me, the Kerala Budget has ticked most of the right boxes in the current situation.

thehindu.com,"Budget 2024 on welfare schemes: Expenditure cut or remain stagnant, say Left parties","In a bid to reduce the fiscal deficit, the Union government has cut down on expenditure that has led to welfare schemes and capital expenditure being curtailed and this would negatively impact future growth and economic fundamentals, the CPI(M) said critiquing the 2024 Interim Budget.

The Union Budget, the CPI(M) Polit Bureau said in a statement here, reveals the grim economic situation confronting India’s working class. As per the Budget tabled in Parliament on Thursday, the revenue receipts in 2023-24 exceeded the budget estimates and grew by 13.3 per cent compared to the previous year.

Citing these figures, the Polit Bureau said that Central government expenditures have been squeezed below budget estimates in order to reduce the fiscal deficit. These expenditures have grown by only 7 per cent, less than even the nominal growth of GDP, which is officially expected to be 8.9 per cent. This shortfall in expenditure has taken place despite the establishment expenditure of the government being higher than budgeted. “The axe has, therefore, fallen on expenditures on welfare schemes as well as on capital expenditure. This will negatively impact future growth and economic fundamentals,” the party said.

Expenditures on several sectors like agriculture and allied activities, education, health, social welfare, and schemes like the PM Krishi Sinchayee Yojana and umbrella schemes for SCs, STs and other groups have been kept below budgeted levels, the CPI(M) noted.

The revised expenditures on PM Awas Yojana, PM Gram Sadak Yojana, and PM Poshan are not only lower than budgeted, they are even less than the expenditures in 2022-23. “Schemes specifically for women and children have also seen a reduction on both counts,” the Polit Bureau observed.

The CPI(M) said that the estimated ‘real’ growth of 7.3 per cent in 2023-24 is pure fiction and is based on the “absurd proposition that the inflation rate has come down to barely 1.6 per cent in 2023-24”. This figure, the party said, is completely at odds with the inflation rates based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is around 6 per cent with food inflation of around 10 per cent. “This Budget carries forward the vicious ‘development model’ of the Modi government which squeezes the livelihood of the vast majority of India’s working people to favour the maximisation of profits for the few,” the CPI(M) Polit Bureau stated.

CPI General Secretary D. Raja, called the Budget as disappointing. “FM’s Interim Budget speech was disconnected with micro reality and was focused on presenting a rosy picture of the economy before elections. BJP has shown loyalty to corporates continuously by slashing corporate tax. Borrowings are at record high and common people are suffering with high inflation,” he said in a post on X.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-expenditure-on-welfare-schemes-cut-or-remain-stagnant-say-left-parties/article67800321.ece

thehindu.com,Interim Budget 2024: What can it do for real estate?,"The Indian real estate sector, particularly housing, is at a critical juncture as we approach the Union Budget for 2024-2025. Considering the forward momentum seen in 2023, alongside global economic challenges and the stagnation in affordable housing, there are several key areas the sector should focus on in its demands from the upcoming budget.

Though this is an Interim Budget, traditionally viewed as a stop-gap arrangement before a full-fledged Budget post-general elections, it still holds significant potential for addressing immediate concerns and laying groundwork for future policies.

An Interim Budget, typically presented in an election year, is meant to cover the government’s expenditure for a part of the year until a new government presents the full Budget. However, it is not necessarily just a stop-gap arrangement but also an opportunity for the incumbent government to outline its vision and set the tone for future policies.

Real estate stakeholders therefore look to it as an opportunity to introduce critical reforms or support measures, even if they are to be fully fleshed out in the full Budget.

1. Addressing the affordable housing challenge

The stagnation in affordable housing has been a critical issue over the past few years. The sector requires enhanced Budget allocations for existing affordable housing schemes. Streamlining of approvals and clearances for affordable housing projects to expedite development as also tax incentives for developers focusing on affordable housing segments are also the need of the hour.

2. Tackling funding issues

Liquidity crunch has been a significant challenge for real estate developers, especially post the NBFC crisis. The Budget should focus on measures to ease liquidity for real estate projects, possibly through dedicated funds or special windows under institutions like National Housing Bank (NHB). Reforms or relaxations in external commercial borrowing (ECB) norms to allow more foreign capital in real estate, and strengthening REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) framework to attract more investment must also be considered.

3. Taxation reforms

Taxation remains a critical aspect of real estate investment and development. The sector’s demands include rationalisation of GST rates on real estate projects. This is important. While GST aimed to simplify taxes, its structure for real estate has been complex, with issues like input tax credit causing concerns among developers. Rationalising GST rates for raw materials used in affordable housing or providing input tax credit benefits can reduce the overall cost of construction, indirectly benefiting buyers.

Additional tax deductions for homebuyers, particularly in the affordable and mid-income segments are vital. Currently, under Section 24(b) of the Income Tax Act, taxpayers can claim a deduction on home loan interest. Increasing this limit, especially for affordable housing, would make buying homes more attractive for the lower and middle-income groups. Under Section 80C, there is a deduction for the repayment of the principal amount of home loans. Increasing this limit for affordable housing can be another incentive.

Enhancing additional tax deductions for first-time homebuyers in the affordable housing segment can also incentivise more people to invest in property.

Incentives for sustainable and green building practices through tax rebates can be made attractive.

In addition to all this, providing tax deductions to those offering rental properties in the affordable segment can promote rental housing, which is a critical need in urban areas.

4. Regulatory and policy reforms

Policy reforms are essential for sustained growth. The sector needs streamlining RERA across States for uniformity and better compliance. Policies promoting rental housing as a viable option, which is critical for urban areas with migrant populations, should be focussed on, besides clarity and support for digitisation in land records and transactions.

5. Focus on infrastructure and urban development

Infrastructure is the backbone of real estate growth. The Budget should consider increased spending on infrastructure, particularly in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Policies to integrate urban development with transportation, like Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) must be given due importance.

6. Encourage Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

To attract more foreign investment, the Budget could relax FDI norms in certain real estate segments. Clarity and stability in policies must be provided to build investor confidence.

7. Boost sustainable development

With increasing focus on sustainability, the sector requires incentives for projects adhering to green building norms. Support for innovation in sustainable materials and construction technologies must be adequately provided.

8. Support technology adoption

Technology is already revolutionising real estate. The Budget should focus on incentives for adopting technology in construction and property management, and support PropTech startups through funding and policy initiatives.

Without a doubt, of all the above-mentioned points, affordable housing is the segment which most needs an immediate shot in the arm. The government had set a very high expectations benchmark for it with its Housing for All target. It can go a long way in using this Interim Budget to set the stage for a robust comeback of this critically important segment.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024-25 may set 5.3% of GDP fiscal deficit goal: ICRA,"Rating firm ICRA said on Thursday it expects the government to set a fiscal deficit target of 5.3% of GDP in the upcoming Union Budget for next year, covering half the distance to its commitment to achieve a deficit of 4.5% of GDP for 2025-26.

While the deficit for this year is unlikely to overshoot the ₹17.9 lakh crore target, with the National Statistical Office estimating a lower nominal GDP growth of 8.9% compared with 10.5% estimated in the Budget, the fiscal deficit is expected to hit 6% of GDP for 2023-24, instead of the 5.9% target.

Factoring in the 3% of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) borrowing limit for States set by the 15th Finance Commission for 2024-25, ICRA expects the General Government deficit to dip to 8.3% of GDP next year from 9.2% of GDP expected this year. “This would be the lowest level of the General Government deficit since 2019-2020, when it was 7.2% of GDP,” it said in a report on expectations from the Interim Budget to be presented on February 1.

While ICRA believes the government will have fiscal room to raise its capex target by 10% over this year’s levels to around ₹10.2 lakh crore, it noted that a higher capex target would impinge on the Centre’s ability to bridge half the required fiscal consolidation next year and make meeting the 2025-26 target even more challenging.",Left,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/budget-2024-25-may-set-53-of-gdp-fiscal-deficit-goal-icra/article67731197.ece
