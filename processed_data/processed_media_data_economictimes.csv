indiatimes.com,Get over LTCG tax shock! 9 booster dosages in Budget 2024 that will reward equity investors handsomely in the long run,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented a landmark Union Budget on July 23, 2024, setting a comprehensive roadmap for a developed India by 2047, a vision named 'Viksit Bharat'. While the government has partially restored the indexation benefit on long term capital gains from property, land and building (indexation phenomenon of India was anyway something unique globally), increasing capital gains tax rate on equity , there are quite a few things of the budget which have gone unnoticed which have the potential to create a better life and good amount of wealth generation for its citizens. However, they have probably got buried in the negative din and also because they are a heavy read, too voluminous for most of us to go through.We all know that India is the fastest growing major economy in the world, growing at a high GDP rate for the past four years, despite plenty of global and local disruptions. The current budget has tried to further strengthen the economy to sustain this high growth rates in the long term. To be able to do that, the Govt has identified nine priority areas which, as per the Govt, will continue to figure in the next budgets for the Govt's rest of the term. These areas point at parts of the economy which continue to remain weak or need a booster growth dose to enable the march to the goal of 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047. I have tried to capture their essence in this article.Before I go ahead, a normal question that could be asked - ""that's something which is not happening in 'my world', how does it concern me?"" This is so because a large number of us seem unable to make connections between what's happening in the economy at large and the money that they have made from their equity and mutual fund investments.We all have seen the great infrastructure buildout that's happening - it could remind one of the infra push in the USA in 20th Century. And this has happened while maintaining a good fiscal balance, and a good growth rate despite Covid and so many other challenges. No other large economy around the world has managed to do so.So, anybody with some interest in equity investing or having benefited from it in the past two years would've seen how our equity CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) has inched up to really impressive numbers. This is 'India Tailwind' for almost all of us who may have some misconceptions about our own self being great investors or stock-spotters. It is in fact the strength of Indian economy which has made stock markets go up.Coming back to the start point, let us see what is the Govt aiming to go ahead with which has a big potential to ensure that the economy continues to do well making the stock markets remain strong and equity investors continuing to gain from its long-term uptrend.The budget addresses low productivity in agriculture, aiming to enhance yield through research and innovation. Plans include releasing 109 high-yielding and climate-resilient crop varieties, promoting natural farming for one crore farmers and implementation of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in agriculture.Recognizing the demographic dividend, the budget focuses on skilling and employment. Three 'Employment Linked Incentives' schemes based on EPFO enrolment will be launched, with a target to generate 4.1 crore jobs over the next five years and an allocation of Rs 2 lakh crore. Additionally, Rs 1.48 lakh crore is allocated for skilling 20 lakh youth, upgrade 1,000 industrial training institutes and offer internship opportunities in 500 companies for one crore youth, who will receive a monthly allowance of Rs 5,000.The budget adopts a saturation approach to education and health, with continued support for craftsmen, artisans, self-help groups, and marginalized communities through schemes like PM Vishwakarma, PM SVANidhi, National Livelihood Missions, and Mudra loans.To boost the MSME sector, the budget introduces initiatives such as the Rs 5 lakh crore Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme to help MSMEs enhance their global competitiveness. Plans include the development of ""plug and play"" industrial parks, rental housing for industrial workers, and increased Mudra loans.Urban development envisions 'Cities as Growth Hubs' through economic and transit planning, with a focus on developing peri-urban areas, Transit Oriented Development, more housing under PM Awas Yojana Urban, and efficient rental housing markets.Energy security policies will balance employment, growth, and environmental sustainability, with initiatives like PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, Pumped Storage Policy, and the development of small and modular nuclear reactors.Infrastructure development remains a priority, with significant allocations for roads, highways, railways, airports, and more. Long-term interest-free loans to states, market-based financing frameworks, and private sector participation will support infrastructure creation.Innovation and R&D will be scaled up through the Anusandhan National Research Fund and a Rs 1 lakh crore financing pool for private sector-driven research and innovation. The space economy will be expanded with a Rs 1,000 crore venture capital fund.Next-generation reforms will improve productivity of factors of production and enhance market efficiency. The government will formulate an Economic Policy Framework to guide these reforms, emphasizing the digitization of land records and proper mapping of urban and rural land.Overall, the Union Budget 2024 is a forward-looking document aimed at sustaining high growth rates and addressing challenges to achieve the goal of 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047. Through strategic investments in agriculture, employment, manufacturing, urban development, energy security, infrastructure, innovation, and next-generation reforms, the NDA Government aims to propel India towards becoming a developed nation. This ambitious roadmap is poised to boost investor confidence and drive robust equity markets, heralding a new era of economic prosperity in India.(The article is written by Col Sanjeev Govila (retd), Certified Financial Planner, CEO, Hum Fauji Initiatives, a financial advisory firm.)",Center,Center-Right,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/get-over-ltcg-tax-shock-9-booster-dosages-in-budget-2024-that-will-reward-equity-investors-handsomely-in-the-long-run/articleshow/112399195.cms

The Union Budget for 2024-25 has nothing for the salaried class , and the middle class, and it neither addresses the issue of unemployment nor takes any step to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure for households, Congress MP Amar Singh said in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. Initiating the debate on the Finance Bill , the Fatehgarh Sahib MP said it appears in the Budget that the Union government was taxing the poor, while sparing the rich.""From what the government has proposed, it appears the Centre intends to take away every single rupee from the salaried class, the common man, while the rich are being spared,"" Singh said.""If we look at Income Tax, the tax on individuals is 19 per cent of total tax, while the corporate tax is 17 per cent. Why is the income tax more? In every way, you are increasing individual tax, and bringing down the corporate tax. Who is the government working for?"" he asked.He said the World Inequality Report has revealed that one per cent of the richest people in India have 40 per cent of the wealth, and accused the government of benefitting the higher income groups.""I want to suggest the finance minister. Around 70 per cent Income Tax Returns have nil tax... Exempt those up to Rs 5 lakh income, it will increase public consumption and reduce poverty,"" he said.He questioned whether the exemptions given by the government to the corporate have generated any jobs.""The government provides relaxations so that employment is generated. The government should tell how much employment has been generated through these corporate concessions. It's not right that you keep giving concession while no employment is being generated,"" he said.He said the Economic Survey has said India needs to generate an average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs annually until 2030 in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising workforce.""We need some relief in this Budget. CRISIL report shows household savings have come down to 18.3 per cent, this is a decadal low... financial liabilities are at all-time high,"" he said.""It means people are facing hardships in day-to-day expenditure. Consumption is not increasing because liabilities are high,"" he said.He also claimed the finance minister said nothing about food inflation which is at 10 per cent.""Around 50 per cent of the population depends on agriculture, and income through agriculture is 18.4 per cent of the GDP... This means 50 per cent population is surviving on 18 per cent income,"" he said.""This is the reason behind the problems in the agriculture sector, whether it is farmers suicide, or the protests,"" he added.He also questioned what the government was doing on its promise for a law guaranteeing a minimum support price (MSP) on crops to farmers who protested against the now-scrapped farm laws.BJP MP Nishikant dubey, meanwhile, welcomed the Budget and called it ""historic"".""Across the world, economies are growing at 2.5 per cent to 2.7 per cent. India is a ray of hope for the world,"" he said, lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for it.""We are working towards the goal of a developed India by 2047,"" he said.Dubey said the NDA government has proposed to abolish angel tax, as it is competing with Singapore and Abu Dhabi, adding that it will generate employment.He further attacked the Congress over its demand for a caste census.""I want to ask the Congress, many people in this country do not believe in religion, caste... how will they participate in caste-based census?"" he said.Dubey also said he has with him the Congress manifestos from 1952 to 1990, and claimed it said the party was against OBC reservation.

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024 proposed 10% TDS on government bonds: You can still pay lower or zero TDS with this certificate,"How to reduce or eliminate deduction of TDS from government bonds





How to get a lower or nil TDS certificate



What will be the impact of TDS being levied on government bonds

Which investors may be more impacted due to levy of TDS on government bonds

Does it matter where you buy government bonds from- stock market or RBI?

In Budget 2024 , it was announced that starting from October 1, 2024, tax deducted at source (TDS) will be deducted at a 10% rate from specified central and state government bonds , including floating rate bonds.""In the Union Budget 2024, the Government has proposed a 10% TDS on all central government securities , state government bonds, and state development loans (SDLs), effective from October 1, 2024,"" says Vijay Kuppa, CEO, InCred Money. This move is likely to have a big adverse impact on investors who primarily depend on the interest earned from such government securities.The Floating Rate Savings Bond will come under this new TDS rule. ""Budget 2024 proposed to amend Section 193 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 by levying TDS on Floating Rate Savings Bond, 2020 (Taxable) or any other security of the Central Government or State Government as the Central Government shall notify,"" says Atul Puri, Managing Partner and Co-Founder at SW India.According to Puri, if your income tax assessing officer (AO) grants you a lower or nil TDS certificate, then you will not be required to pay 10% TDS on the interest earned on government bonds.""As per section 197 of the Act, in a case where TDS is required to be deducted under section 193 of the Act and assessing officer is satisfied that the total income of the recipient justifies deduction of income-tax at a lower rate or no deduction of income-tax, as the case may be, the AO shall, on an application made by the Assessee, give him/her such certificate as may be appropriate for lower or Nil deduction of tax. Hence, the option of lower or Nil deduction certificate can be availed by the investor in case of such investments,"" says Puri from SW India.The AO will not automatically grant this lower or nil TDS certificate, if you think you should get a lower or nil TDS, then you need to present your case before him/her. If only the AO is satisfied with your case, then the certificate is given. The AO will evaluate the estimated tax liability on the current financial year's projected income and the tax liabilities from the previous financial years.""The Assessing Officer will take into consideration any advance tax payments, TDS, and tax collected at source (TCS) for the current financial year up to the application date. If the AO determines that the estimated tax liability is NIL or negligible and the application of the standard TDS/ TCS rates is unnecessary, a certificate specific to the deductor and the service/ section will be issued under section 197 for NIL or lower TDS. The validity of the certificate will be from the date of issuance until the end of the financial year, unless the AO revokes it before its expiration,"" says Professor Arunava Bandyopadhyay, Assistant Professor - Finance, International Management Institute Kolkata (IMI Kolkata).An alternative way to eliminate TDS being deducted from government bonds is by submitting Form 15 G/H if your income is below the basic exemption limit -- which is Rs 2.5 lakh under the old tax regime and Rs 3 lakh under the new tax regime for a person below the age of 60""As per Section 197A(1A) and 197A(1C), no deduction of tax shall be made under section 193 in case of a person (not being a company or a firm), who furnishes Form 15G/H and declare that his/her total income does not exceed basic exemption limit. Hence, investors can submit Form 15G/H to prevent deduction of TDS,"" says Puri.According to Bandyopadhyay from IMI Kolkata, Section 197 facilitates taxpayers to apply for a lower TDS certificate or an exemption from TDS. Individual taxpayers without any business income can initiate an online application on the TRACES portal.""The applicant must complete and submit the prescribed form number 13 along with all supporting documents, which includes income computation for the current financial year, tax returns for previous financial years, and other relevant evidence as required on a case-to-case basis. To ensure faster processing, it is advisable to complete the form with accurate details. If the Assessing Officer is satisfied with the application and the documents provided, a certificate for lower deduction or non-deduction of TDS will be issued,"" says Bandyopadhyay.According to Kuppa, the government's decision to levy TDS on government bonds means that the interest you receive (on such notified government bonds) will be subject to TDS deduction.Kuppa explains with an example. Consider a central government bond, such as the 07.10 GS 2034. If you purchase 1,000 units (post October 1, 2024) with a face value of Rs 100 (total investable amount of Rs 1 lakh), and the interest is paid semi-annually, you will receive a coupon interest payment of Rs 3,550. With the new 10% TDS being levied on such interest, Rs 355 will be deducted, resulting in a payment of Rs 3,195 as interest.In order to receive the amount of TDS deducted, you (deductee) need to file the income tax return (ITR) for the relevant financial year in which the TDS was deducted. ""An investor can claim the benefit of TDS so deducted in their income tax return. The amount of interest paid / credited, and TDS deducted will be reflected both in AIS and Form 26AS of the deductee. It is very clear that TDS is required to be deducted only on the income earned as interest and not on the principal value,"" says Puri.According to chartered accountant Manoj Dembla, who has over 30 years of experience in finance, accounting, taxation, and insolvency, ""Income from Government Bonds, i.e. interest on Securities, is subject to TDS @10% and taxed at normal rates, but if you buy and sell it resulting in capital gains, then if the same is held and sold in less than a year, it will be taxed as Short Term Capital Gains (STCG) and if it’s sold after holding it for more than a year, it will be taxed as Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) @12.5%.""According to Kuppa, if you rely on government bonds for a consistent interest income as an investor, you may be particularly affected by the government's decision.""This change may impact investors who depend on the regular interest income from these securities, potentially disrupting their cash flow. However, it is likely to be a short-term reaction, with investors eventually adapting their investment strategies accordingly. There is a remote possibility that investors can move to Mutual funds to invest in Gilt funds which has a government securities as its underlying,"" says Kuppa.Experts suggest that the government's decision to impose TDS on government bonds aims to ensure that this type of investment is on par with other bonds.""TDS is levied on interest on Corporate Bonds at 10%. TDS on corporate bonds was levied in 2023, while Government securities and State government bonds were kept out of its ambit. The government has made this move with the expectation of bringing all instruments at par from a taxation point of view,"" says Kuppa.As per Puri, section 193 states that the person responsible for paying a resident any income by way of interest on securities will, at the time of crediting such income to the account of the payee or at the time of payment, whichever is earlier, deduct income-tax.""Accordingly, there is no difference in withholding tax provisions, whether we buy from RBI Retail Direct or from the stock market,"" says Puri. This means that the TDS mechanism will remain the same regardless of how you buy the bond.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/tax/budget-2024-proposed-10-tds-on-government-bonds-you-can-still-pay-lower-or-zero-tds-with-this-certificate/articleshow/112290303.cms

Gradual Change in LTCG Regime?

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024 adopts multifaceted approach to bolstering manufacturing sector,"By Saurabh Agarwal and Mohit Sharma

inter alia

(Saurabh Agarwal is Partner, EY India and Mohit Sharma is Director, EY India)

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-adopts-multifaceted-approach-to-bolstering-manufacturing-sector/articleshow/112216383.cms

The last Budget presented by the Manmohan Singh government in 2014 was of Rs 16 lakh crore. Ten years later, the Union Budget 2024 presented by us a few days ago is Rs 48 lakh crore, which is three times, Modi said.Modi also said that the capital expenditure allocation under his governments has grown manifold.""Capital expenditure is called the biggest productive medium of resource investment,"" he said at the ‘Journey Towards Viksit Bharat: A Post Union Budget 2024-25' conference. In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government. PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest. He also noted the time when India had been ranked among the ‘Fragile Five’ economies in the world. Modi said that his governments have progressively helped India move from a state of vulnerability to a place of strength.PM Modi also said that in a world where most economies are struggling with low growth and high inflation, India stands out as an economy which is seeing high economic growth and low inflation. He also said that India's fiscal prudence has become an example for the world to see.Modi spoke of the government's initiatives to transform the manufacturing sector of the economy with steps like 'Make in India', Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, liberalisation of FDI norms, setting up of multi-modal logistics hubs.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the first Union Budget of the newly elected NDA government on July 23, 2024.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-prime-minister-narendra-modi-address-at-cii-post-budget-conference-top-takeaways-highlights/articleshow/112129118.cms

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024 misses mark on comprehensive custom duty rationalisation, say experts","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s budget announcements regarding custom duties will streamline exporters’ business and benefit sectors such as electronics, textiles, leather, seafood and solar energy.“A wide range of changes have been proposed in customs laws. The impetus being ‘ Make in India ’,” says Shashaank Gupta, Founder, Marg Tax Advisors. “The government has also proposed a reduction in export duty applicable on leather items such as tanned or crust hides of skins, raw fur skins, and tanned or dressed fur skins. The said changes shall drive growth and enable cost competitiveness for the domestic industry.”The Union Budget 2024-25 proposed that basic custom duty (BCD) be reduced to 5% on certain broodstock, polychaete worms, shrimp & fish feed; BCD be reduced on real down filling material from duck or goose; and BCD on methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) for the manufacture of spandex yarn be reduced from 7.5% to 5%. Additionally, customs duty is proposed to be removed on oxygen-free copper for the manufacture of resistors, and certain parts for the manufacture of connectors are to be exempted.Industry observers see these as well-intended moves that would spur the domestic manufacturing ecosystem and cut reliance on imports.Stakeholders in the electronic industry are pleased that the measures will spur production in the MSME ecosystem . Lalit Arora, Co-founder of MSME electronic firm UBON, says, “The announcement to reduce BCD on mobile chargers by 15% is particularly encouraging and will spur domestic manufacturing, benefiting both consumers and manufacturers.”However, Mandeep Arora, Co-founder of Vingajoy, says while these initiatives deserve praise, there remains an opportunity to address urgent needs such as reducing red tape and enhancing direct financial incentives for sustainable technologies. Only then will the intended goals of such announcements be fulfilled, say industry officials.One thing that caught the attention of MS Mani, Partner at Deloitte India, was the fact that this year the finance minister brought up the topic of indirect taxes first and then moved to direct taxes. “Does this show a shift in the thought process that over a period, indirect taxes are going to be more important as part of the tax collection compared to direct taxes?” asks Mani.There was also a mention of further rationalising GST, which the industry has consistently requested. “Even for a very complex country like ours with a basket of goods and services, different consumption models across the country, it can’t be more than three. But we have many more rates. So, when there was a mention of rationalising GST further, I think she was alluding to the fact that in the subsequent GST Council meetings, we are going to see some discussion on rates and maybe a few months from now the move towards having fewer rates in GST together with the inclusion of petroleum products in a phased manner,” he adds.Beyond the hits of the budget, Mani says this budget had its share of misses relating to customs duty. One observation is that there hasn’t been extensive rationalisation in customs duty rates. “For an importer or an exporter, determining the precise tariff and reading the chapter-wise exemption notifications is still quite difficult. Some simplification in this respect was expected.

indiatimes.com,Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms
indiatimes.com,Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024? Experts decode,"Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries. (AI image)

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/are-nps-vatsalya-hiked-nps-deduction-limit-for-private-sector-employees-good-moves-from-budget-2024-experts-decode/articleshow/112108765.cms

indiatimes.com,Union Budget 2024: 3 sectoral mutual funds in limelight. Should you invest?,"The finance minister announced budget allocations to various sectors, with significant amounts designated for agriculture, defense, and infrastructure. In the budget speech, Nirmala Sitharaman allocated Rs 1.52 lakh crore to agriculture and allied sectors, Rs 4.54 lakh crore to the defense sector and infrastructure sector was allocated Rs 26,000 crore.After the budget allocations made to different sectors, mutual fund advisors and experts have been recommending sectoral mutual funds based on three sectors such as infrastructure, banks and financial services, and consumption. ETMutualFunds reached out to few other experts to know how these three sectors are expected to perform going forward and what strategy should be followed by an investor if they make an allocation in these sector based funds.“Although some negative for taxpayers, the government has balanced out the budget with continuity in policy and capex expenditure side by side addressing the needs for lower middle income group with focus on skilling and job creation for youth under employment linked incentives while keeping lower fiscal deficit,” said Mayur Shah, PMS Fund Manager, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.Manish Kothari, Co-founder & CEO, ZFunds believes that the latest budget is more balanced and marks a shift towards enhancing the purchasing power and disposable income of the middle and lower classes. The strategic move will give a boost to the consumption sector.“This strategic move is expected to stimulate demand for discretionary goods and services, which could lead to a surge in the performance of consumption sector funds. Some parts of the consumption sector have underperformed in the broader market in the last couple of years but now look attractive,” said Kothari.“In the last few union budgets, the NDA Government has prioritised the infrastructure and defence sector significantly increasing investment in this area, which boosted the performance of the funds in this sector,” said Manish Kothari.“Overall capex allocation of Rs.11.1 trillion 3.4% of GDP is positive for infrastructure -Road and Railway, defence, construction, telecom, power & manufacturing sectors. Although valuation stretched in some of the pockets, the sector remains positive for investments,” said Mayur Shah.“For the banking sector, Budget is neutral with lower fiscal deficit becoming more supportive for interest rates. To meet the financing needs of the economy, the government will bring out a financial sector vision and strategy document to prepare the sector in terms of size, capacity and skills. This will set the agenda for the next five years,” commented Shah.“The banking and financial Services sectors also look attractive given the tailwinds of stable interest rates, a robust economy and a strong balance sheet,” commented Kothari.In the last one year, banks & financial services sector based mutual funds have offered an average return of around 23.38% of which Quant BFSI Fund offered the highest return of around 62.16%.The consumption based and infrastructure sector based mutual funds have offered an average return of around 36.03% and 65.53%, respectively. Nippon India Consumption Fund offered the highest return of around 41.91%. Bandhan Infrastructure Fund offered the highest return of around 84.03%.“Though we like the above sectors, we do not advise a disproportionate allocation to these sectors. Investors can look at 10-15% allocation. Investors who are already invested in Infra sector, should also keep in mind the above range,” recommended Kothari.“Investors should allocate 50% - 60% of the Equity portfolio between Infrastructure, consumer discretionary and housing sector to participate in India Growth Story,” recommended Shah.: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The enhanced tax deductions, increased Mudra loan limits, and concessions for MSMEs are expected to boost entrepreneurial growth. The reduction in tax for foreign companies from 40% to 35% is anticipated to attract higher FDI, creating new growth opportunities.Karan Verma, Co-Founder and Director of FAAD Network emphasised the budget's dedication to economic stability and growth. He highlighted the introduction of a new ₹5,000 crore fund to support innovation and the extension of tax benefits for startups. The establishment of a ₹1,000 crore venture capital fund for the space economy demonstrates a forward-looking vision, positioning India as a leader in this emerging sector. These measures are expected to provide a significant boost to the startup ecosystem, fostering innovation and long-term growth.Vijay Navaluri, Co-founder & Chief Customer Officer of Supervity, praised the budget for its strong emphasis on technology and innovation.

Supervity AI anticipates these developments will propel India towards becoming a global tech leader.Shashank Saurabh, Co-founder & CEO of QUE, expressed enthusiasm about the budget’s support for digital and infrastructure growth. The abolishment of the Angel Tax and the focus on digital public infrastructure align with QUE's mission to leverage digital advancements.

The special attention to MSMEs and initiatives to foster entrepreneurship are seen as positive steps that will benefit the startup ecosystem and the broader economy.Sajju Jain, an entrepreneur, startup coach and Harvard Business School alumnus, acknowledged the abolition of the Angel Tax as a positive move. He welcomed the allocation of Rs. 2 lakh crores for employment creation and skill development, especially through internships in top companies. However, he noted that direct support for startups in the budget remains limited, and sustained support will be necessary to build long-term capacity and capabilities.Mr. Soumya Sarkar, Co-Founder of Wealth Redefine (AMFI registered MFD), commended the government's fiscal discipline, highlighting the fiscal deficit target of 4.9% of GDP. The budget’s focus on infrastructure, rural development, employment, and skilling initiatives promises to drive economic growth and create new opportunities. The abolition of the Angel Tax for startups is seen as a crucial boost for the entrepreneurial ecosystem. However, the proposed tax hikes on short-term and long-term capital gains might dampen investor sentiment despite the simplification of capital gains taxation.Gautam Madhavan, Founder and CEO of Mad Influence, welcomed the budget's focus on economic growth and support for innovation. The emphasis on digital public infrastructure and the abolition of the Angel Tax are expected to empower digital creators and influencers, fostering a vibrant and sustainable digital economy.Arun Alagappan, Executive Chairman, Coromandel International Limited, said, “The government’s commitment to get 1 crore farmers into organic farming and promote large-scale horticulture production in the next two years will significantly increase agricultural productivity and sustainability. The establishment of the proposed 10,000 need-based bio-input resource centres will help in making natural farming more accessible to Indian farmers. Furthermore, the emphasis on strengthening the production, storage, and marketing of pulses, along with financing for shrimp farming, showcases a holistic approach to supporting diverse agricultural activities. The allocation of ₹1.52 lakh crore for agriculture and allied sectors is a clear indication of the government's dedication to transforming this critical sector,"" he said.He added that the government’s plan to implement digital crop survey for kharif crop in 400 districts as well as the release of 109 weather resistant seeds, will drive innovation and efficiency in farming practices.Priyadarshi Nanu Pany, Founder & CEO, CSM Tech, found the Budget's focus on MSMEs very nuanced on the sector's challenges and potential.""The credit-centric measures—including the new guarantee scheme, stress-period support, and the digital footprint-based assessment model could revolutionise MSME financing. By reducing reliance on collateral and traditional metrics, these initiatives promise to unlock capital for a broader spectrum of enterprises, potentially catalysing growth and job creation. The expansion of TReDS and SIDBI's reach demonstrates a commitment to improving liquidity and financial inclusion across MSME clusters,"" he said.Overall, the Union Budget 2024-25 is seen as a forward-looking initiative aimed at boosting economic growth, fostering innovation, and improving the ease of doing business in India.

indiatimes.com,Union Budget 2024: How to rejig your MF portfolio after change in tax structure,"After Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced changes in tax structure for mutual funds and budget allocation to different sectors, investors are looking out for options to make fresh investments by trying to identify profitable sectors/themes. ETMutualFunds reached out to experts to know their views on the same.Sitharaman on Tuesday announced changes to the tax rates on financial assets, specifying that short-term gains on specified financial assets will now be taxed at 20% instead of the previous 15%. However, the applicable tax rates for other financial and non-financial assets remain unchanged.Long-term gains on all financial and non-financial assets will attract a 12.5% tax rate. Effective from July 23, 2024, equity mutual funds and shares with a 12-month holding period will continue to attract a 20% tax for short-term capital gains ( STCG ) and 12.5% for long-term capital gains ( LTCG ).“We believe that the budget had two clear directions - firstly; it has tried to shift the focus for investors to invest longer term by increasing the differential between short term and long term capital gains rates in equity from 5% to 7.5% and secondly it has made asset classes relatively tax neutral allowing investors to invest on the merit of the asset class basis their risk tolerance, investment time horizon and financial goals, rather than making decisions basis more attractive tax rates for one asset class over another,” recommended Vishal Dhawan, CEO, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors, a wealth management firm in Mumbai.An advisor recommends that the asset allocation should be based on financial goals and risk tolerance rather than taxation.“An investor’s asset allocation should be primarily driven by his financial goals and risk tolerance rather than taxation. Taxation is something which is not in an investor’s control and hence the only thing that an investor can do is to work around it by investing in a tax efficient product within a chosen asset class,” said Nilesh D Naik, Head of Investment Products, Share.Market.He also added, “From that perspective, in this budget, we have seen an attempt to bring most of the products at par, from taxation perspective. For long term wealth creation, equity funds continue to be the right investment choice, despite the recent changes in taxation. For diversification and hedging against inflation, the change in taxation of funds in categories such as gold funds, overseas fund of funds, etc will now provide more tax efficient options to investors.”Another expert believes that post-budget, the investment landscape has shifted. Equity-oriented funds remain attractive for long-term wealth creation due to potential tax benefits. However, debt funds have become less appealing.“Post-budget, the investment landscape has shifted. Equity-oriented funds remain attractive for long-term wealth creation due to potential tax benefits. However, debt funds have become less appealing due to the removal of indexation benefits. Investors should carefully evaluate their risk tolerance and investment horizon before making decisions. A balanced approach, considering both equity and debt, might be prudent. Investors might refrain from making long-term investments in real estate after the removal of indexation benefits in tangible assets as well,” suggested Sonam Srivastava, Founder and Fund Manager at Wright Research.The finance minister in the budget, announced allocations to several sectors such as Rs 1.52 lakh crore for agriculture and allied sectors, Rs 4.54 lakh crore for Defence sector, and Rs 26,000 crore for infrastructure sector , according to a report by the Fisdom Research.Post the budget allocation made to some sectors, which sectors or themes are likely to perform and which sector/theme should mutual fund investors choose for investments going forward?Naik of Share.Market recommends that events such as this create a lot of excitement among investors, one doesn’t necessarily need to react to every news.He said, “When it comes to mutual fund investing, it’s important to take a long-term view and invest based on a proper investment plan aligned with your overall investment objectives and risk tolerance. While events such as this create a lot of excitement among investors, one doesn’t necessarily need to react to every news. Good investing is often boring. For most investors, there may not be a real need to have sectoral or thematic funds in their portfolios to achieve their long-term financial goals. Moreover, if a particular sector or theme is poised to do well, then nothing stops the diversified funds from being flexible to increase allocation to it and yet provide the benefit of necessary diversification required in the fund’s portfolio.”Vishal Dhawan suggested that, “We believe that most sectors and themes continue to be at premiums to long term average and the budget has not created opportunities from a thematic basis. On a relative basis, as private banks are probably one of the spaces that are at a discount to long term averages, one can explore these from a longer term perspective.”Another expert believes that the Union Budget 's allocation for infrastructure, while maintaining its importance, fell short of expectations given the anticipated surplus from the RBI dividend.“The Union Budget's allocation for infrastructure, while maintaining its importance, fell short of expectations given the anticipated surplus from the RBI dividend. This could temper investor enthusiasm for the sector, though its long-term prospects remain positive due to the government's consistent emphasis on infrastructure development,” said Sonam Srivastava.She also mentioned, “A notable shift towards the consumption sector is evident, with increased focus on agriculture, horticulture, and housing finance. This could benefit sectors like FMCG, consumer durables, and cement. While infrastructure might witness a more gradual uptick, the consumption-oriented sectors are poised for accelerated growth in the near term. Overall, the budget has laid a foundation for balanced growth, with infrastructure as a steady driver and consumption as a potential catalyst.”In the budget announcement, the finance minister announced that the holding period for equity FoFs, overseas FoFs (international funds) and gold mutual funds has been reduced from more than 36 months to more than 24 months. The Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax rate has been adjusted to 12.5% from earlier of being taxed as per tax slab rate, while the Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) tax rate remains unchanged.After a change in taxation for international funds, gold funds, and equity FoF, will these categories become more attractive?“Recent tax changes have made international funds, gold funds, and equity FoFs more attractive investment options due to the implementation of a flat 12.5% long-term capital gains tax. These changes offer investors potential tax benefits and diversification opportunities. While these categories have become more tax-efficient, their performance will ultimately be determined by market conditions and the funds' underlying holdings,” said Sonam Srivastava.“With rationalisation of tax rates and holding periods, the relative attractiveness of domestic equity via a vis international equities has reduced, and thus investors can consider more diversified portfolios in equity, along with allocations to debt that can gain from the fiscal prudence and stable government borrowing program, with gold as an asset class that could gain from lower interest rates globally and protect against INR weakness against the US dollar,” said Vishal Dhawan.And lastly, Nilesh D Naik said, “Taxation for funds in these categories was hit adversely post the changes announced in the Finance Act 2023, as the indexation benefit was taken away and they were getting taxed at slab rate. However, post the changes announced in this budget wherein investments held in these funds for over 24 months will qualify for long term capital gains taxation, funds in these categories will definitely become more attractive from a taxation perspective. As previously mentioned, one should look at them for investing only after evaluating whether they fit into one’s asset allocation needs based on their goals and risk tolerance and not just due to favourable tailwinds in terms of taxation.”: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Budget 2024: Big Relief To Indian Taxpayers | Changes In New Regime Slabs | Nirmala Sitharaman

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure, despite the indexation benefit being withdrawn for property, and asserted that govt decided on the new structure after undertaking an elaborate exercise.“This perception that you will be at a disadvantage is not realistic, it’s absolutely not correct… In almost every case people have a lower tax burden under this system.The small or the medium people who are going into the market or property investments are going to benefit from it,” she told TOI in an interview.On Tuesday, she had announced a reduction in long term capital gains tax on property and gold from 20% to 12.5%, while withdrawing the benefit to adjust it for inflation. This came with the provision that indexation benefit will be available for properties bought up to 2001.The FM said the amendments have been proposed with the intent to simplify the tax regime and bring all asset classes at par.Sitharaman said the Union Budget presented on Tuesday was a continuation of the interim budget and insisted that the measures announced for Andhra Pradesh were part of the commitments given at the time of bifurcation of the state . “In Bihar’s case can anyone deny the devastation that happens because of Kosi flooding?” she said.She also said that the skilling plan through internship was voluntary for companies and she had received suggestions for such a scheme from various industry bodies. “We're not forcing anybody, we've had a lot of discussion with CII and Ficci and they thought it is possible to do it. It will actually help because they will have industry-ready people, who can be employed.”She hit out at the Opposition, saying, “This brazen method of building a false narrative, repeating it and restating it with the hope that it will stick has been tried in the Lok Sabha elections. They are trying it even now.”Along with the calculations released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes under different scenarios, tax authorities said, “Nominal real estate returns are generally in the region of 12-16% per annum, much higher than inflation. The indexation for inflation in in the region of 4-5%, depending on the period of holding. Therefore, substantial tax savings are expected for a vast majority of taxpayers.”The statement further said that the new regime is beneficial for five-year old properties under the new regime which have seen an appreciation of 1.7 times or more. Similarly, for 10 years, if the value rises 2.4 times the new mechanism is seen to be beneficial. Ditto for property purchased in 2009-10 with appreciation of 4.9 times or more, the tax department said.“It's only where returns are low (less than about 9-11% per annum) that the earlier tax rate is beneficial, but such low returns in real estate are unrealistic and rare (less than 10% of cases),” it said.Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra told TOI that benefits of reinvesting the capital gains in a new property and parking the funds in tax-exempt 54EC bonds issued by REC are intact.Asked about the revenue impact, he said that the Centre may end up losing revenue as most taxpayers are likely to gain from the decision.“Simplification of any tax structure has benefits of ease of compliance, including computation filing, maintenance of records. This also removes the differential rates for various asset classes,” CBDT said.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-most-people-will-be-better-off-even-without-indexation-fm-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/111997135.cms

indiatimes.com,Union Budget 2024: Govt focus on development of border villages continues; Rs 1050 cr allocated for Vibrant Villages Programme,"

As the government continues its thrust on comprehensive development of villages located remote areas along the border with China, the Union Budget has allocated Rs 1,050 crore for the Vibrant Villages Programme (VVP) that will benefit select villages in 19 districts in Arunachal Pradesh Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh. The government approved the VVP as a centrally-sponsored scheme on February 15, 2023, with an outlay of Rs 4,800 crore for 2022-23 to 2025-26 for development of these villages in 46 blocks abutting the northern border.The budget, presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday, has earmarked Rs 1,050 crore for the VVP for 2024-25.The objective of the programme is comprehensive development of these villages to improve the quality of life of people and thereby reversing out-migration, officials said.The VVP, which is being implemented by the Union home ministry, envisages focused areas of interventions for creation of opportunities for livelihood generation through promotion of agriculture, horticulture, tourism and cultural heritage, skill development and entrepreneurship, development of co-operative societies for managing livelihood opportunities including agriculture, horticulture, cultivation of medicinal plants and herbs, road connectivity, housing and village infrastructure, energy including renewable energy, television and telecom connectivity, financial inclusion, etc.One of the sectors identified for development is promotion of tourism and culture by augmenting various tourism-related infrastructure, promoting community managed home stays, organising local fairs and festivals, promoting eco-tourism, agro-tourism, wellness, wildlife, spiritual and adventure tourism and local cuisines.The VVP was conceived as an outcome-oriented programme with outcome indicators at three levels-village, household and individual beneficiary.Under the VVP, so far 136 border villages are being provided connectivity through 113 all-weather road projects at a cost of Rs 2,420 crore.Mobile 4G connectivity is being worked on rapidly in these areas and by December, all villages under the VVP will be covered by the 4G network, officials said.Showing its focussed attention, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, after assuming charge in the Modi 3.0 government, had reviewed the implementation of the VVP at a high-level meeting here on July 13.He had stressed the need to provide employment opportunities to the residents of border villages and increase connectivity to prevent migration from such remote areas.Shah had directed authorities to continue the efforts being made by senior ministers and officials to better understand the issues of border villages under the special initiative taken by the central government.He said the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Army deployed around the border villages should encourage purchase of local agricultural and handicraft products through cooperatives.The home minister said the healthcare facilities of the Army and CAPFs should be regularly made available to benefit the residents of nearby villages.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/govt-focus-on-development-of-border-villages-continues-rs-1050-cr-allocated-for-vibrant-villages-programme/articleshow/111986888.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Cancer patients get relief but senior citizens missed the attention,"

The Union Budget 2024 has allocated ₹90,959 crore to the health sector , reflecting a substantial 12.6% increase from the previous year. The budget prioritizes the Department of Health and Family Welfare with ₹87,657 crore and the Department of Health Research with ₹3,302 crore.Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY, which offers a health cover of ₹5 lakh to 12 crore poor and vulnerable families, received ₹7,300 crore, up by ₹500 crore from last year's ₹6,800 crore. Despite this increase, the plan to include all senior citizens above 70 years in the scheme remains unfunded. An official commented, “The expansion must be approved by the Union Cabinet, and there must be a special provision to allocate funds for this purpose. It will take time.”Despite the substantial budget allocations, the omission of the health cover for senior citizens above 70 under Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY is a significant unfulfilled promise. This inclusion was expected to require an additional ₹4,000 to ₹5,000 crore, which was not allocated. The absence of this provision highlights a critical gap in the budget, leaving many elderly citizens without the promised healthcare coverage.In a TOI report, Shailesh Mishra of Silver Innings NGO, highlighted the importance of addressing senior citizens' needs, stating, “The senior citizen railway concession was crucial for the mobility and independence of the elderly.” He also pointed out that the call to withdraw the 18% GST on mediclaim services and accommodation for senior citizens had been ignored. Furthermore, there was a plea to include all individuals over 60 years of age in the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme irrespective of their age.Currently, the government has announced that only people who are over 70 years of age will be automatically eligible for free healthcare. Mishra emphasized, “The Niti Aayog report 2023 and Economic Survey 2024 had highlighted the importance of addressing senior citizens' health and other issues, yet these concerns were overlooked in the budget.”Several senior citizen groups had petitioned the government to increase the old age pension from ₹3,000 to all non-taxpaying seniors. Experts had also called for a national policy on dementia.One of the key highlights is the exemption of three cancer drugs—Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, Osimertinib, and Durvalumab—from customs duties. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated, “To provide relief to cancer patients, I propose to fully exempt three more medicines from Customs duties.” This move aims to reduce the cost and improve the accessibility of these life-saving treatments, crucial for various cancers including breast, lung, and urothelial carcinoma.Anand K, Managing Director & CEO of Agilus Diagnostics, praised the measures: “The exemption of critical cancer medicines from custom duty is a crucial step in making life-saving treatments more accessible.” Sudhir Mathur, Founder & CEO of Meradoc Healthtech Ltd, applauded the forward-thinking proposals, particularly the abolition of Angel Tax for all investor classes.Dr. P N Arora, Chairman of Yashoda Super Speciality Hospitals Kaushambi, remarked, “The first budget of Modi 3.0 presented by FM Nirmala Sitharaman has outlined nine priority areas paving the way for ‘Viksit Bharat’. The announcement to exempt three more essential medicines for cancer treatment comes as a big relief for patients.”Tamanna Singh, Co-founder of Menoveda, added, ""The Union Budget's allocation of ₹90,658.63 crore for the health sector is a major step towards enhancing India's healthcare infrastructure .""The budget also proposes changes to the basic customs duty for X-ray tubes and flat panel detectors used in medical X-ray machines. These adjustments aim to align with the phased manufacturing program and support the Make-in-India initiative.The AYUSH Ministry's budget saw a significant increase from ₹3,000 crore to ₹3,712.49 crore, a 23.74% hike. This boost reflects the growing importance of integrating traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda, Yoga, and Homeopathy into mainstream healthcare.The budget allocation for schemes under the Department of Health and Family Welfare has been increased to ₹87,656.90 crore. The National Health Mission’s budget rose from ₹31,550.87 crore to ₹36,000 crore. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (PM-JAY) saw an increase from ₹6,800 crore to ₹7,300 crore. For the National Tele Mental Health Programme, the allocation increased from ₹65 crore to ₹90 crore.Himanshu Sikka, Lead - Health at IPE Global, noted, “The limited mention of the health sector in today's budget speech is not surprising, given the substantial provisions already made in the Interim Budget.”Dr. Kumardeep Dutta Choudhury, Director of Medical Oncology at Max Hospital Shalimar Bagh, stated, ""The exemption of customs duties on cancer drugs such as Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, Osimertinib, and Durvalumab will have a profound impact on patients battling cancer.""The Union Budget 2024 emphasizes improving healthcare accessibility and infrastructure through increased funding and strategic exemptions. While the budget addresses several critical areas, the exclusion of senior citizens' health cover under Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY stands out as a key unfulfilled promise, reflecting a significant gap in the government's healthcare strategy.(With inputs from TOI)",Center,Center,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/budget-2024-cancer-patients-get-relief-but-senior-citizens-missed-the-attention/articleshow/111975842.cms

The finance minister has included these leather and other critical outputs under the duty free scheme i.e. import of goods under concessional rates of duty scheme.Mukhtar-ul Amin, former CLE chairman and managing director of Super House Group said, “The budget has laid a strong foundation for overall growth and development of the leather and footwear sector by facilitating export increase and employment. The reduced export duties on leather will facilitate leather manufacturers and leather products exporters to increase their export and achieve the set objective.""The three schemes for employment-linked incentive is a unique package of the Prime Minister’s package for man force. The scheme is expected to create additional employment for 50 lakh persons.Chartered accountant Bajpai commented that The changes in tax slab percentages under the new tax regime were expected to provide benefits of up to Rs 17,500 assesses and there was a provision for salaried employees.

Chandigarh: Even as the budget allocation for Chandigarh remains the same in the Union Budget 2024-2025, announced on Tuesday, as was in the interim budget held in February this year, the UT administration and MC are now free to spend as per the requirements. Under the interim budget, allocation was being done on a monthly basis, with sole emphasis on revenue budget .The total budget outlay for the city stands at Rs 6,513.62 crore for the FY 2024-2025. In 2023-2024 fiscal, it was Rs 6,087.10 crore.The capital outlay remains the same as announced in the interim budget. For the current fiscal, the allocation under capital head is Rs 655 crore. The revenue budget outlay for the 2024-2025 fiscal stands at Rs 5858.62 crore, an increase of Rs 493.55 crore from Rs 5365.07 crore for the FY 2023-2024.For the fiscal 2023-2024, there was a 33% increase in the budget capital outlay.

Whereas education, sports, art and culture, social security and welfare, road transport, tourism, public works, and police are major losers with their capital outlays being slashed in the interim budget.Notably, even though the central government, specifically the Prime Minister’s Office, recently made a renewed push for expansion of renewable energy in the city, the capital outlay for the new and renewable energy remains stagnant and unchanged for the coming fiscal year.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/chandigarh-union-budget-2024-2025-spending-power-unleashed-no-change-in-size/articleshow/111972859.cms

Exporters have noted that the actual export price of onions (after adding export duty) is around $750 per tonne, which is significantly higher when compared to prices quoted by Pakistan ($370 per tonne) and China ($400 per tonne).""We expected an announcement about either removing or reducing MEP and export duty on onions.There was no such announcement in the Budget,"" said Vikas Singh, vice-president of the Horticultural Produce Exporters' Association.""Currently, the country is exporting onions at a price that is much higher than the prices quoted by Pakistan and China.

As the dust around the Union Budget 2024 settles down, potential losers in the market as a result of announcements or rather lack of it, are coming to the fore. Sectors that are likely to get negatively impacted in the near term are banks, NBFCs, asset management companies (AMCs), real estate, consumer, defence, OMCs and select stocks in the new age space according to estimates by top brokerages.Here's what they say on sectors, stocks:Macquarie in its budget review note sees absence of tax breaks on deposits as a near term negative for the sector. JM Financial sees hikes in the Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) and Short Term Capital Gains (STCG) as net negative for AMCs as over 70% revenues come from equity schemes which now could make it less attractive compared to FDs.The government hiked LTCG to 12.5% versus 10% earlier and STCG to 20% versus 15% earlier. According to JM, HDFC AMC , Nippon Life Asset Management India (NAM) and UTI AMC are potential near-term fallouts.The withdrawal of indexation benefits is a negative for the real estate stocks, Macquarie noted. The view is also endorsed by JM Financial Institutional Securities.Finance Minister Nirmala Sithraman on Tuesday announced reduction in long-term capital gains (LTCG) on property sales from 20% to 12.5% along with the removal of indexation benefit, which adjusts purchase price for inflation and reduces taxable profit.As per JM's calculations, the new LTCG regime will increase the cost of holdings by 2-3% with impact varying across micro-markets and time periods. It has named stocks like DLF Prestige Estates among potential losers along with listed REITs.While the government has allocated Rs 11.11 lakh crore for infrastructure development which was a status quo on the interim budget, the expectation was for a higher outlay from a section on the D-Street. Macquarie does not see it as a positive for infrastructure companies as it said that there is no increase in allocation towards capital expenditures.The government announced a cut in the customs duty on gold and silver to 6%. ""To enhance domestic value addition in gold and precious metal jewellery in the country, I propose to reduce customs duties on gold and silver to 6 per cent and that on platinum to 6.4%,"" the budget speech said.InCred sees this reduction in customs duty as a short-term negative for the gold loan companies like Manappuram Finance and Muthoot Finance. A fall in gold prices is the biggest risk to gold loan companies as it may result in sporadic repayment by borrowers as the value of the ornaments may fall below the value of the loan, it said in a note.Gold prices have jumped by 16% in 2024 so far, which has led to higher lending by gold lenders on the same quantity of gold and, in turn, boosting gold loan AUMs in recent quarters, it said.InCred also sees allocation of Rs 86,000 crore made towards Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme (MNREGA) for FY25F (Budgeted estimate) flat on the year-on-year basis compared to the Revised Estimate, which in-turn is lower by 5% YoY when compared to FY23 actuals.As for Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM Kisan), the budgeted estimate of Rs 60,000 crore for FY25F is also the same as the Revised Estimate of FY24F and is 3% higher YoY compared to FY23 actuals. There has been no change to allocations under PM Kisan since the interim budget, it said.The brokerage estimates a neutral impact as a result of these measures despite the positives of a 40% higher allocation of (Rs 2.7 lakh crore) towards rural development and provision of Rs 1.52 lakh crore for agri and allied activities among other initiatives.D-Street was betting big on the defence sector but appeared a touch disappointed on the budget outlay to the sector at Rs 4.54 lakh crore for FY2024-25 — a significant climbdown from Rs 6.21 lakh crore allocated by the government in the February interim Budget.Elara Capital in a note said that the allocation failed to live up to the high expectations the markets were pricing-in. Allocation to this brokerage, the naval fleet has not changed from what was laid out in the interim budget, while that to heavy and medium vehicles rose 12%.It called it a change in ""defense priorities"" adding that the anticipation of additional announcement towards defense, specifically Navy, had led to a re-rating within the sector, with prices of Cochin Shipyard , Garden Reach Shipbuilding and Mazagaon Dock up by 296%, 197% and 133%, respectively.Also Read: Defence stocks HAL, Bharat Dynamics, others recover from 10% fall post budget jitters According to Macqurie's estimates government thrust on grassroots job creation, skilling, internships could help expand the formal workforce and as such potentially increase cost of gig labour. As a result, Zomato and Delhivery could be losers from the budget announcement, it said.Stocks of oil marketing companies (OMCs) have recovered after a negative closing on Tuesday. They ended in the red after the Union Budget 2024 did not make any budgetary allocation for them for FY25. The development assumes importance given that the government had in its FY24 budget earmarked Rs 30,000 crore for capital support to the OMCs which did not crystallise the financial year gone by.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/budget-2024-realty-banks-defence-among-9-sectors-that-appear-short-term-losers-heres-why/articleshow/111989635.cms

Budget 2024 announced a slew of initiatives to boost the micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). While the budgetary allocation in 2024-25 for something remains identical to the budget estimates of 2023-24 at Rs 22,137.95 crore, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a package covering financing, regulatory changes and technology support for MSMEs.For instance, public sector banks will build in-house capability to assess MSMEs for credit, instead of relying on external assessment, the budget proposed. Sitharaman also announced a mechanism to facilitate continuation of bank credit to MSMEs during a period of stress. The limit of Mudra loans will be enhanced to Rs 20 lakh from Rs 10 lakh for entrepreneurs who have availed and successfully repaid previous loans under the “Tarun” category. The allocation under Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) has also been increased to Rs 6 lakh crore from Rs 5.25 lakh crore in 2023-24, said the budget.Let us look at the key figures relating to certain central schemes and see how they fare when compared with last year’s allocation.The Scheme for Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI) has been allocated Rs 260 crore — a drop of 7.14% YoY. The scheme was launched in 2005 to make traditional industries more productive and competitive by organising them and artisans into clusters and to provide support for their long-term sustainability. But the allocation for the Khadi Gramodyog Vikas Yojana has gone up 13% to Rs 1,037.19 crore.A look at the figures for the MSME ministry’s popular Scheme for Promotion of Innovation, Rural Industry and Entrepreneurship (ASPIRE) reveals that its outlay of Rs 20 crore is lower than last year’s Rs 22.23 crore. Introduced in 2015, ASPIRE is aimed at promoting startups for innovation and entrepreneurship in agroindustry.The MSME Champions Scheme has seen a rise in outlay from Rs 52.72 crore to Rs 54.72 crore. It was started by merging some components of the Technology Upgradation Scheme to modernise clusters and enterprises, reduce wastages and sharpen business competitiveness.The outlay for the Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) and Other Credit Support Scheme has seen a fall of 14.81% this time — from Rs 2,700 crore to Rs 2,300 crore. Launched in 2008, PMEGP is a credit-linked subsidy scheme that aims to generate employment in the non-farm sector in rural and urban areas.The allocation earmarked for the Credit Support Programme has come down from Rs 500.08 crore to Rs 0.04 crore — a hint that the government is probably trying to do away with the scheme. A steep fall can also be seen in the allocation earmarked to the Guarantee Emergency Credit Line (GECL) facility that aims to enable MSMEs meet their operational liabilities and restart businesses. It is down 30% from Rs 14,100 crore to Rs 9,812.93 crore.Further, the Distressed Assets Fund has been allocated nothing this year (Rs 0.04 crore last year).This Scheme seeks to extend support to the promoter(s) of the operational MSMEs which are stressed and have become NPA as on 30th April, 2020; - Promoter(s) in turn will infuse this amount in the MSME unit as equity and thereby enhance the liquidity and maintain debt-equity ratio.The allocation for the Credit Linked Capital Subsidy (CLCS) is at Rs 0.55 crore this time from Rs 1.06 crore last time. The objective of the Scheme is to facilitate technology up-gradation in MSEs by providing an upfront capital subsidy of 15% (on institutional finance of up to Rs 1 crore availed by them) for induction of well-established and improved technology in the specified 51 sub-sectors/products approved.This year, the government has reduced the outlay for some marketing-based schemes of MSMEs. For instance, the outlay for Procurement and Marketing Support Scheme has been reduced from Rs 96.35 crore to Rs 65 crore.The Entrepreneurship cum Skill Development Programme (ESDP) saw a rise in allocation from Rs 80 crore to Rs 99 crore. The Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance (RAMP) allocation remains the same at Rs 1,170 crore. The RAMP scheme, in particular, aims to enhance MSMEs’ competitiveness and productivity by providing financial and technical support, they add. Increased funding to this scheme would facilitate better access to capital, advanced technology and expert guidance, helping MSMEs to innovate and expand.Notably, the allocation to the Micro and Small Enterprise-Cluster Development Programme (MSE-CDP) more than doubled from Rs 150 crore to Rs 400 crore.The outlay for entrepreneurship and skill development schemes has increased slightly from Rs 80 crore to Rs 99 crore. The amount for the Fund of Fund (FoF) scheme has remained the same at Rs 575 crore.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-which-msme-schemes-got-more-money-and-which-ones-have-lost-out/articleshow/111981282.cms

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget for 2024-25, the first under the Modi 3.0 government, on Tuesday. The budget will outline the government's financial plans aimed at driving economic growth, enhancing infrastructure, and promoting social welfare.The budget will have a significant impact on various sectors, including mutual funds, with important expectations spanning agriculture, consumer and investor confidence , tax reforms , and sectoral allocations.The implications for mutual funds, in both equity and debt categories, are considerable.Under this category, funding will be increased to support agricultural infrastructure, irrigation projects, and rural development programs. Encouraging agri-tech and innovation through modern farming practices and technology will be a key expectation from the forthcoming budget.Steps to protect consumer interests and ensure fair market practices by strengthening regulatory frameworks will be a major highlight. Investor-friendly policies to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and make business easier, creating a favorable investment climate, are expected. Changes in financial markets to increase transparency, reduce volatility, and protect investors' interests are also anticipated.Income tax relief by adjusting tax slabs and rates to provide relief to the middle class, potentially increasing disposable income and consumer spending, is a major expectation. Simplifying and rationalizing the capital gains tax structure across various asset classes to reduce complexity and improve compliance is expected. Corporate tax reductions, especially for MSMEs, to stimulate business activity and investment, are also anticipated.The increased capital expenditure on infrastructure is expected to benefit equity mutual funds with significant exposure to sectors like construction, cement, steel, and engineering. Infrastructure-focused funds could see enhanced performance due to the boost in government spending.The budget's emphasis on green initiatives and technology adoption may lead to higher returns for funds invested in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and tech sectors.The fiscal deficit target indicates a focus on fiscal discipline, which may result in stable interest rates. This environment is favorable for debt mutual funds, particularly those invested in long-term bonds, as bond prices tend to rise when interest rates are stable or falling.With increased government spending and economic growth, the overall credit environment is expected to improve, reducing credit risk and benefiting credit risk funds invested in lower-rated corporate bonds.The new tax regime with revised income tax slabs is likely to result in higher disposable income for individuals, potentially boosting investments in tax-saving instruments like Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS).Enhanced support for agriculture and rural development could benefit mutual funds focusing on these themes. Funds investing in agri-tech, rural infrastructure, and related sectors may see positive performance.Increased funding for healthcare infrastructure and research could boost mutual funds with significant investments in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors.The budget's focus on growth, fiscal prudence, and sustainability is likely to boost investor confidence. This positive sentiment could lead to higher inflows into mutual funds as investors seek to capitalize on the anticipated economic growth.The Indian Budget 2024-25 will present a balanced approach, focusing on economic growth through increased capital expenditure and green initiatives while maintaining fiscal discipline. This budget is expected to have a positive impact on the mutual funds sector, with significant opportunities for both equity and debt funds. Investors should consider aligning their portfolios to benefit from the government's emphasis on infrastructure, sustainability, and fiscal prudence. By staying informed and strategically adjusting their investments, mutual fund investors can potentially enhance their returns in the post-budget period.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-key-expectations-and-impact-on-mutual-funds/articleshow/111943795.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Understanding the bahi-khata and why Nirmala Sitharaman replaced the traditional briefcase,"The transition to 'bahi-khata'

What is a 'bahi-khata'?

From briefcase to bahi-khata: The evolution of India's budget presentation

18th Century Britain: The tradition of using a briefcase for the budget started.

1860: British budget chief William E. Gladstone used a red suitcase with the Queen's monogram for budget papers.

1947: India’s first Finance Minister, RK Shanmukham Chetty, used a leather portfolio for the budget.

2019: Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the 'bahi-khata', replacing the briefcase.

2021: Sitharaman moved to a paperless budget, using a digital tablet wrapped in a 'bahi-khata' style cover.

Reason behind the change from briefcase to bahi-khata

Digital format for budget

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , adorned in a white silk saree, will present the Union Budget 2024-25 in Parliament using a digital tablet encased in a traditional 'bahi-khata' style pouch. This method continues the paperless format adopted by the Narendra Modi government.In 2019, Sitharaman replaced the colonial-era budget briefcase with a 'bahi-khata', and in 2021, she transitioned to using a digital tablet.This year marks her seventh consecutive budget presentation.The 'bahi-khata' is a red pouch that contains the digital tablet with the Budget documents. It features a golden national emblem and symbolises a shift from the traditional briefcase used in the past.The tradition of using a budget briefcase dates back to the 18th century in Britain. The term 'Budget' originates from the French word 'bougette', meaning a small leather briefcase. Here’s a brief history of how India’s Budget presentation has evolved:Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman replaced the briefcase with the 'bahi-khata' to ""break from the colonial legacy"" of the leather briefcase. After her 2019 Budget presentation, she emphasised the need to move away from the ""British hangover"" and embrace something uniquely Indian. She also found the 'bahi-khata' easier to carry.In 2021, Sitharaman adopted a digital format for the Budget, using a tablet encased in a 'bahi-khata' style cover. This move followed criticism from Congress leader and former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, who suggested that a future Congress finance minister might use an iPad. Despite the criticism, Sitharaman has continued with the digital tablet for the Budget presentations in 2021, 2022, and 2023.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-understanding-the-bahi-khata-and-why-nirmala-sitharaman-replaced-the-traditional-briefcase/articleshow/111949236.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: The time limit for which income tax reassessment can be done is reduced,"What did Budget 2024 propose

Union Budger 2024 proposed to reduce the time-limit for which reassessment can be done and rationalisation of the provisions.""Time limit for reassessment is proposed to be reduced from ten years to five years. Further, there are proposals to rationalise the procedure for reassessment. Further, it is proposed to omit reference to Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner in section 275 to provide clarity of time limitation for imposition of penalties. It is also proposed to withhold refund up to sixty days of assessment under section 245 and to rationalise time limit to file appeal to ITAT under section 253,"" said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Budget speech 2024.According to S Ramakrishnan, Former Chief Commissioner of income tax., ""With a view to rationalize and also to provide certainty to tax proceedings, time limit for reopening assessments under section 149 are proposed. In normal cases no notice of reopening of assessment can be issued after 3 years and 3 months from the end of the Assessment Year. In Specific cases (i.e., cases where the department has information that income escaped assessment is Rs 50 lakh or more) no notice of reopening of assessment can be issued after 5 years (as against 10 years presently).""""At present if taxpayer files return claiming refund and assessment proceedings are pending for any earlier year, department can withhold issue of refund till completion of pending assessment. Tax demand raised in pending assessment becomes due only after 30 days after passing assessment order. Therefore, withholding of refund is proposed to be permitted further upto 60 days from the date of completion of assessment,"" says Ramakrishnan,.""Proposal under section 253 to provide that the appeal before the ITAT may be filed within two months from the end of the month in which the order sought to be appealed against is communicated to the assessee as against 60 days time limit for filing appel before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,"" says Ramakrishnan.""The Union Budget 2024 introduces significant changes aimed at streamlining and rationalizing the process of reassessment and related procedures under the Income Tax Act. Cases where Income Tax officer believe some income was not assessed correctly or escaped assessment, and the income escaped assessment amounts to or is likely to amount to fifty lakh rupees or more, the officer had the option to issue a notice before the end of ten years from the end of the relevant assessment year. Budget 2024 has amended the Section 149 and provided the maximum time limit to issue the notice under this clause from 10 years to 5 years. This reduction provides greater certainty to taxpayers by ensuring that past assessments are not indefinitely open to scrutiny, thereby enhancing taxpayer confidence. Additionally, it is expected to lead to more efficient tax administration and reduce prolonged litigation and disputes,"" says CA Manas Chugh, Head Regulatory Practice, Osgan Consultants Private Limited.According to Priyanka Jain, associate partner, Vaish Associates Advocates, ""The income tax searches are important investigative proceedings for unearthing black money. However, there were multiple problems that are arising under the present scheme of search assessment under section 148 of the Act. The absence of any legal requirement for consolidated assessments in search cases had led to a situation where every year only the time-barring year is reopened in the case of the searched assessee. This results in staggered search assessments for the same search and consequentially, the searched assessee may be engaged in the search assessment process for almost up to ten years. This is time-consuming process which escalates the litigation cost for the taxpayer as well as for the department. For the duration of such period, legal position on an issue may undergo change, leading to different additions in different years, on the same issue leading to uncertainties for the taxpyers. Further, by the time the subsequent years are reopened, since such a long duration is involved, there is a possibility of change of opinion with respect to the line of enquiry. Further, due to such staggered assessments, coordinated investigation is not feasible in search cases. To overcome these issues, the Budget proposes to re-introduce the scheme of block assessment for the cases in which search under section 132 or requisition under section 132A has been initiated or made on or after September 1,2024. This would benefit by ensuring early finalization of search assessments, coordinated and efficient investigation during search assessments and reduction in multiplicity of proceedings and thereby reducing the cost of litigation for the taxpayers.”",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/tax/the-time-limit-for-which-income-tax-reassessment-can-be-done-is-reduced/articleshow/111951732.cms

Shares of Housing Finance Companies were under spotlight after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced three crore more houses under the PM Awas Yojana in her Union Budget Speech today.“Three crore additional houses under the PM Awas Yojana in rural and urban areas in the country have been announced, for which the necessary allocations are being made,” said FM Nirmala Sitharaman.Under the PM Awas Yojana Urban 2.0, housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle-class families will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The total amount will include the central assistance of Rs 2.2 lakh crore in the next 5 years and a provision of interest subsidy to facilitate loans at affordable rates is also envisaged.Analysts believe that these announcements are marginally positive for the sector.“While we await details from the fine print, prima facie, these announcements appear to be positive for construction companies. Housing finance companies, particularly those focused on low ticket housing, would also be beneficiary of the PM Awas Yojana. Having said that, the disbursements under such schemes in the past have made up a very small proportion of the loan books of these companies,” said Tejas Gutka, Fund Manager, Tata Asset Management.“The allocation of Rs 10 lakh crore for housing the urban poor is poised to significantly enhance the profitability of small ticket-size housing finance companies. Companies such as LIC Housing HUDCO , and Aadhar Housing Finance are expected to see an upward trajectory in revenue and PAT in the coming quarters, this potentially drives a surge in their share prices in the longer run,” said Raj Gaikar, Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities while commenting on the government’s allocation for housing.However, post the budget speech, the shares of housing finance companies tumbled up to 6% on BSE with HUDCO 6% to Rs 306 and PNB Housing Finance shares falling 5% to Rs 756 on BSE.Other housing finance stocks like CanFin Homes, Indiabulls Housing Finance , Aadhar Housing Finance and Aptus Value Housing Finance fell between 1-2.5%The budget has focused on employment creation, supporting MSMEs, rural development, boosting the green economy, housing for the poor, and supporting innovation.

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: From skilling to logistics, industry expects significant announcements from FM","As the anticipation builds for the Union Budget 2024-25, leaders from various sectors are voicing their hopes and recommendations for how the government can foster growth and innovation. From technological advancements to agriculture, and from startup ecosystems to regulatory reforms, the expectations are diverse and reflect the multifaceted challenges and opportunities facing India.Bharath Aitha, Vice President of Marketing at eInfochips (An Arrow Company), emphasises the need for robust public-private partnerships and enhanced investment in R&D to maintain India’s technological leadership. “In the face of global economic uncertainties, the upcoming budget represents a pivotal opportunity for India to fortify its economic resilience by propelling its technological leadership,” he says. Aitha calls for significant investments in skilling and reskilling the workforce in critical areas such as AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity. Additionally, he advocates for incentivising innovation through tax breaks and grants for R&D, which will attract international investments and nurture a thriving tech ecosystem.Rampraveen Swaminathan, Managing Director and CEO of Mahindra Logistics Ltd says there is a renewed sense of anticipation and optimism within the logistics sector. “Building on the interim budget's foundation, we foresee this budget to significantly boost infrastructure investments, particularly in multi-modal transport and advanced warehousing. We expect a continued emphasis on green energy and strong EV infrastructure, accelerating our journey towards green logistics. Focus on automation and digitization across the logistics value chain will be crucial to achieving higher efficiencies and reduced costs,” says Swaminathan.Additionally, expediting the National Logistics Policy and projects like ONDC, ULIP and direct freight corridor is essential for creating a unified logistics ecosystem. Addressing skill development in the sector is vital to meet the demands of modern logistics, Swaminathan adds.Rakesh Kumar, Founder Square Insurance, says currently, there is a limited tax exemption on health insurance premiums. The expectation is to raise the tax exemption limit to Rs 75,000, which would make healthcare more affordable for individuals. Kumar also draws attention to another area of insurance- there are no specific insurance incentives for electric vehicles (EVs). “The expectation is to introduce subsidies or tax credits for comprehensive EV insurance to promote EV adoption by addressing insurance concerns,” he says. He adds that currently, home insurance premiums do not qualify for tax deductions. “The expectation is to introduce a tax deduction under Section 80C, aiming to encourage homeowners to protect their assets,” says Kumar.Akshal Agarwal, Co-Founder at NatureNurture, brings attention to the importance of education spending. He argues that while historic spending on education has hovered around 3% of GDP, a more significant portion of the budget should focus on improving the quality of teaching and learning processes rather than just infrastructure. “Investments made on school infrastructure should be part of the infrastructure budget, and the education spending should solely focus on improving teacher quality, creating robust audit and assessment methods, implementing technology solutions in the classroom, and forming partnerships that benefit learners,” he explains. Agarwal stresses the need for qualitative metrics to measure educational progress, moving beyond just Gross Enrolment Ratios.Agri is a backbone of India and Rohit Bajaj – Co Founder Balwaan Krishi, believes the government should introduce a multi-pronged approach to incentivise agritech ventures. This could include tax breaks to encourage entrepreneurs. “Offer a 10-year tax holiday for startups and small businesses engaged in developing and implementing agri-tech solutions. Provide direct subsidies of up to 50% on capital expenditure for setting up food-processing units, factories for farm machinery production, organic waste recycling plants,biogas production units, or nutrient recovery facilities. The subsidies could be linked to the amount of the quantity of products generated,” Bajaj says.He adds that exports of agri-produce is full of opportunity. “Offering interest-free or low-interest loans with extended repayment periods for agritech ventures. This would make companies compete in export markets and have competitive advantages. Additionally, the government could consider setting up a dedicated fund with an initial corpus of Rs 1,000-2000 crore to support research and development in the agri tech sector. This fund could be used to provide grants, seed funding, and equity investments in promising agritech startups,” says Bajaj.The over $12-billion waste management sector in India is poised for significant improvements with the right budgetary allocations and government actions, says Abhishek Gupta, Co-Founder WeVOIS Lab.“First, the sector suffers from underfunded infrastructure, with a lack of adequate waste processing and recycling facilities. To address this, the government needs to allocate more budget towards building modern waste treatment plants and recycling units. This increased funding would lead to more efficient waste processing, reduced pollution, and enhanced resource recovery. In the second decade of the Swachh Bharat Mission, we must start taking data-driven decisions. Understanding the behaviour of residents and using data to inform our actions will be crucial,” says Gupta.He pitches for greater private participation in waste management projects through incentives like tax breaks, subsidies, and streamlined regulations to attract private companies. He points out that there are significant technological gaps in the sector, with limited use of advanced waste treatment technologies. “Investing in research and development (R&D) for innovative solutions, particularly in resource recovery and the circular economy, is crucial. Such investments would result in the development and adoption of eco-friendly waste management technologies, promoting sustainable solutions,” says Gupta.Vinay Agrrawal, Founder and CEO of Hubler, highlights the need for tax reforms to enhance the ease of doing business. He points out that while progress has been made, there are still significant impediments, particularly concerning the withholding tax in dealings with overseas consultants. “Addressing these challenges through thoughtful reforms will bolster the confidence of entrepreneurs and investors,” Agrrawal asserts. He advocates for tax reforms that foster a seamless business ecosystem, paving the way for sustainable growth and innovation.Dhawal Jain, Co-Founder & CEO at Mave Health, hopes for increased funding for healthcare, particularly mental health initiatives. He points out that India’s healthcare spending is significantly lower than that of developed countries, emphasising the need for enhanced funding to expand access to quality mental health care. “A well-funded mental health sector can lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and support for those suffering from mental health conditions,” Jain states. He also looks forward to supportive policies that encourage research and technological innovations in mental health care.Kshitij Jain, Co-Founder of All Things People, an HR Tech Startup, calls for greater flexibility in attracting capital and simplified FDI compliance procedures. He notes that startups still spend a disproportionate amount of time and resources managing compliance requirements. “Startups need flexibility to attract capital, both domestic and foreign, without facing onerous regulatory hurdles,” Jain explains. He advocates for easing restrictions on convertible instruments and hybrid securities and simplifying FDI compliance procedures to support startups’ growth.Vikas Singh, Co-Founder of NFTFN, a Web3 Fintech Startup, urges the government to reduce TDS on virtual digital assets (VDA) transfers and allow the offset and carryforward of losses from VDA trading. “Lowering the TDS rate on virtual digital assets from 1% to 0.01% and increasing the threshold limit to ₹5,00,000 will enhance market liquidity and participation,” Singh suggests. He also calls for equal treatment of crypto income and the establishment of a dedicated regulatory body to oversee crypto transactions, ensuring transparency and investor protection.Shubham Jhuria, Partner & CFO at Aeravti Ventures, looks forward to continued government support for business growth, especially within the Aerospace, Defence, Energy, and Agriculture sectors. “In its third term, the Government is likely to maintain its emphasis on business growth in India, fostering the rapid development of the startup ecosystem,” Jhuria notes. He hopes for policy advancements that simplify the establishment of incubators, venture capital funds, and angel investors, thereby reducing compliance complexities and enhancing tax regimes. By addressing these foundational aspects, the government can signal its commitment to making India a global tech leader.As the government prepares to unveil the Union Budget 2024-25, these insights and recommendations from industry leaders highlight the diverse needs and priorities across sectors.

indiatimes.com,What does Union Budget bring to Auto Inc's table: Industry reactions on Budget 2024,"Conquering the Himalayas with the Volkswagen Virtus, Taigun | Volkswagen Experiences

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today presented the Union Budget 2024, bringing a mix of expectations and realizations for the blooming Indian automotive industry. While the sector was hopeful for significant schemes such as the FAME III and other tax incentives to propel electric vehicle adoption and domestic manufacturing , the budget offered a host of measures that will help the industry both directly and indirectly in the long run.The initial reactions from the automotive industry to the Union Budget 2024 have been cautiously optimistic. Here, let’s take a look at how the industry has reacted to the Budget 2024.Vinod Agarwal, President, SIAM and MD & CEO, VECV highlighted the importance of strong fiscal support for infrastructure, saying, ""The liberal allocation for rural development & infrastructure of Rs 2.66 lakh crores is a welcome step that will boost the rural economy.""He further noted the budget's key measures for skilling and upskilling, support to manufacturing and employment generation, support to MSMEs—many of whom form the large supplier base for the auto sector—exemption of customs duty on import of lithium, cobalt, and other rare minerals, and extension of concessional customs duty on Li-Ion cells till March 2026, and withdrawal of the equalization levy of 2% on e-transactions. These announcements, he believes, would continue to propel the growth of the Indian auto industry.Shradha Suri Marwah, President of ACMA and CMD of Subros, noted the budget's role in driving sustainable growth, commenting, ""The budget, a blueprint for Viksit Bharat, will drive sustainable yet inclusive growth, especially in the manufacturing industry, at a rapid pace,""“Focus on strengthening MSMEs through Credit Guarantee scheme and credit support during stress period, measures to bolster energy security and encouragement to start-ups by abolishing angel tax are indeed steps in the right direction. Further, the proposals for personal Income Tax will put more money in the hands of people thus fuelling consumption leading to economic growth.” she added.Santosh Iyer, CEO and MD of Mercedes-Benz India said “The budget clearly underlines Govt’s priorities on creating a robust foundation for a developed Indian economy. We are glad the capex on infra projects tops govt’s priority, with 3.4% GDP allocation. We were expecting GST announcement of long-term continuation of reduced GST for BEVs; however, developing a climate finance taxonomy to aid capital for climate adaptation and mitigating climate change, is a step in the right direction for achieving climate commitments.”Sirajuddin Ali, founder and CEO of Malitra India, emphasized the significance of enhancing road connectivity, stating, ""The allocation of a substantial Rs 26,000 crore fund for enhancing road connectivity is a decisive step towards expanding electric vehicle (EV) accessibility into the rural areas of India.""Uday Narang, Founder and Chairman of Omega Seiki, praised the budget for its visionary approach, saying, ""Exempting import duties on critical minerals, including lithium, cobalt, and other minerals reduces battery manufacturing costs and makes electric vehicles more affordable.""Pritesh Talwar, President EV Business at Lectrix EV said ""The emphasis on improving electricity storage and facilitating the integration of renewable energy is particularly relevant to our work. We believe that services like BAAS (Battery-as-a-Service) can truly transform the EV ecosystem. These initiatives are crucial for advancing battery solutions and expanding the electric vehicle lineup, helping the sector accelerate its progress toward a more robust and sustainable automotive ecosystem. Moreover, the focus on job creation in manufacturing and support for employers promises to invigorate the EV sector as well.""Ravi Machani, Co-Founder and Investor at Tresa Motors, commended the focus on upskilling, stating, ""With the growing demand for expertise in areas like battery technology and power electronics, the budget's focus on upskilling programs and industry-education collaboration is crucial in bridging the skills gap.""Anupam Kumar, Co-founder & CEO of MiniMines, hailed the Critical Mineral Mission as groundbreaking, noting, ""The reduction and exemption of customs duties on critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earths will significantly boost domestic processing and refining capabilities.""Akshit Bansal, CEO & Founder of Statiq, highlighted the waiver of import duties on key minerals, stating, ""The waiver of import duties on key minerals like lithium is a significant step forward, expected to lower the manufacturing costs of EV batteries and, ultimately, reduce EV prices for consumers.""Kunal Gupta, CEO and Co-founder of EMotorad, emphasized the importance of the government's support for the EV industry as he said, ""We are pleased with the government's support for the EV industry by proposing exemptions for lithium, copper, and cobalt from customs duties. Additionally, MSMEs can benefit from collateral-free loans of up to 100 crores for machinery, and the new dedicated e-commerce export hubs are game-changers for manufacturers.""Rajeev Chaba, CEO Emeritus of JSW MG Motor India, highlighted key budget decisions as he said, ""The Honourable Finance Minister’s decision to waive import duties on critical minerals, including lithium, copper, and cobalt, is a step in the right direction for the electric vehicle industry. This move will reduce battery manufacturing costs, making EVs more affordable and attractive. Additionally, the government's initiatives for job creation and investment in industrial training centres will ensure a skilled workforce in the automotive sector. ""Mahesh Babu, CEO of SWITCH Mobility, underscored the budget's impact on the EV ecosystem as he said, ""The budget's import duty exemption for essential raw materials used in battery manufacturing is expected to support domestic cell manufacturers. By lowering the production costs for batteries, this measure has the potential to reduce the overall costs of electric vehicle acquisition.""Rajeev Kapur, MD of Steelbird and President of the Helmet Manufacturing Association India, emphasized the budget's support for the helmet sector as he said, ""The budget 2024 is supportive of the helmet sector's growth and innovation goals, with opportunities to contribute to improved road safety across the country. The new credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs, offering up to Rs 100 crore for collateral-free loans, will benefit smaller helmet manufacturers.""Vikram Handa, MD of Epsilon Group, pointed out the benefits for the battery sector as he said, ""The government’s proposal to fully exempt customs duty on critical minerals like lithium and nickel would definitely benefit industries in the electric vehicle battery supply chain in the short term. However, more needs to be done to develop cathode and anode manufacturing factories in India to development the EV ecosystem.""Bharath Rao, Founder and CEO of Emobi, highlighted key budget measures as he said, ""The Finance Minister's decision to waive import duties on 25 minerals, including lithium, is a significant step forward for the manufacturing sector. This will reduce costs for manufacturing batteries, leading to more affordable electric vehicles for consumers.""Vaibhav Kaushik, Co-founder and CEO of Nawgati, expressed his enthusiasm for the budget's impact on startups as he said, ""I am elated by the government's decision to abolish the angel tax for all classes of investors.

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: Industry calls focus on clean energy ‘pragmatic’, ‘progressive’","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed multiple measures in the budget for the energy sector to improve solar, thermal, nuclear and energy efficiency. Industry players and experts say these measures are encouraging and positive.Some of the measures announced in the budget are policies around pumped storage projects, setting up Bharat Small Reactors power plants, and a road map for hard-to-abate sectors to achieve energy efficiency. Apart from this, the FM also announced exemption and reduction of basic custom duties on solar panels, critical minerals and accessories.Manish Dabkara, Chairman & MD of EKI Energy Services Ltd, says developing a strategic road map for sustainable development and energy security is a commendable move. “The rooftop solarisation scheme is a groundbreaking initiative poised to significantly advance renewable energy adoption, positioning India as a leader in the green energy transition. The emphasis on pumped storage projects is also important for integrating renewable energy into the national grid. Developments in advanced ultra-supercritical thermal power plants and the endorsement of R&D for small and modular nuclear reactors are pivotal for achieving energy independence,” he adds.The rooftop solarisation scheme has generated remarkable response with over 1.28 crore registrations and 14 lakh applications, Sitharaman had said in her speech.Arjun Gupta, Founder and CEO, Smart Joules says that the budget’s emphasis of transitioning from energy efficiency targets to emissions targets under the new Indian Carbon Market model is a welcome step.""Over time we hope the focus from “hard to abate” heavy industries should also expand to include “easy to abate” end uses of energy such as cooling,"" he says.The FM has proposed to expand the list of exempted capital goods for use in the manufacture of solar cells and panels in the country. In addition to this, she had also proposed not to extend the exemption of custom duties on solar glass and tinned copper interconnect.Prashant Mathur, CEO Saatvik Energy, calls the FY25 budget pragmatic and progressive with adequate focus on energy transition. “The response to the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana is heartening and we are confident that solar rooftops will be adopted on a mass scale in the coming years. The budget has further strengthened the domestic solar manufacturing industry by expanding the list of exempted capital goods for use in production of solar cells and panels. The budget’s proposal to not extend the exemption of customs duties for solar glass and tinned copper interconnect will also give a boost to the domestic solar equipment ecosystem,” he says.Pratik Agarwal, Chairman of Gurugram-based Serentica Renewables found the budget’s emphasis on energy transition and decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors commendable.""Emission goals for hard-to-abate industries, and promoting pumped storage projects, will catalyse this transition.

First, there must be a deliberate focus on boosting private investment. Second, the growth and expansion of India's MSMEs (Mittelstand) should be a strategic priority. Third, the potential of agriculture as an engine of future growth must be recognized, with policy impediments removed. Fourth, securing the financing of India's green transition is essential.

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: Transit oriented development, stamp duty reduction to boost housing sale","

Government’s announcement to encourage states to reduce stamp duties and lower it further for properties purchased by women, will further give boosts to growing real estate sector in the country.Most of the states charges between 5-7% of the property cost as stamp duty and post Covid some states reported high sale after lowering stamp duty.Experts said that while stamp duty rationalisation advisory to states and further creating a transparent rental housing market announcements were made, there were no straight solutions offered.“Rationalization of stamp duty across states with an emphasis on women homebuyers will boost home-buyer sentiment across major cities of the country,” said Badal Yagnik, Chief Executive Officer, Colliers India.For a one crore property, buyer saves Rs one lakh if the stamp duty is reduced by 1%.In addition, Transit Oriented Development plans for 14 large cities with a population above 30 lakh will help growth of tier 2 cities.“The push for digitization, efficient land management, and modernized bylaws is also a boost for urbanisation and real estate. This will improve ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes,” said Amit Goyal, Managing Director, India Sotheby's International Realty.Niranjan Hiranandani, Chairman, NAREDCO said that the emphasis on encouraging state governments to reduce stamp duty and other development premiums is a decisive step.“This will not only bolster urban housing growth but also make affordable housing more accessible, optimize development costs, and invigorate the demand curve. The implementation of redevelopment and transit-oriented development schemes merits careful attention, as they are pivotal for driving urban growth, generating employment, attracting investments, and boosting economic growth ,” he said.Sustained infrastructure impetus, reflected in the Rs 11.11 lakh crore Capex allocation, would create a multiplier impact and significant boost in the overall housing sector.“The government's decision to allocate Rs 10 lakh crore under the PMAY Urban Scheme, targeting 3 crore houses and key focus on rationalising stamp duty for Home byers especially for women, underscores a robust vision for urban development and will help homebuyers would save the significant amounts, making home ownership more accessible,” said Pradeep Aggarwal, Founder & Chairman, Signature Global (India) Ltd.The implementation of redevelopment and transit-oriented development schemes merits careful attention, as they are pivotal for driving urban growth, generating employment, attracting investments, and boosting economic growth.""The proposal for states to reduce stamp duty is an encouraging move to stimulate housing demand and growth. Besides, the focus given on Transit Oriented Development (TOD) plans for 14 large cities with populations exceeding 30 lakh is the wider approach to urban development,” said Amit Modi, Director County Group.The proposed developmental initiatives to extend support to major cities' expansion through transit connectivity will give a robust push for infrastructure upgradation as well as to the realty corridors growth.“The rationalisation of differential stamp duty levied across the states would ensure a level playing field and make the cost of investments in immovable property lucrative. Also, concessional rates for women investors would encourage investment by women and make them financially independent,” said Manoj Purohit, Partner & Leader, Financial Services Tax, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India.Additionally, a focus on rental housing in industrial parks via the PPP model, digitizing land records in cities will greatly improve transparency and ease property transactions.“The proposal of increasing the standard deduction for salaried individuals from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000, coupled with the encouragement to states to lower stamp duty and the proposal for reduced stamp duty for women purchasing property, will make home ownership, particularly for first-time buyers, more accessible and financially viable,” said Vishal Raheja, Founder & MD, InvestoXpert.com.Urban centers, being the drivers of growth, saw major allocation and attention in the Union Budget 2024.“More homes under PMAY (U), transit development, creative redevelopment of cities, industrial parks, rental housing for industrial workers, digitization of land records, development of industrial parks and call for moderation in stamp duty, particularly for women buyers are some of the measures that will usher Indian cities towards the path of modernization, enhancing livability and enabling them as growth and employment centers,” said Mohit Jain, Managing Director, Krisumi Corporation.The real estate sector, as partners in this development, will play a major role in contributing towards the government’s urban vision.“Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) on housing sales has been reduced from 20% to 12.5%, however the indexation benefit which was there earlier has been removed. This is more in line with Government’s focus on simplification of tax structure. This would have a short- term impact on the investment demand for residential units, however considering the demand from end users and overall economic growth, this may not have a material impact on the residential sales,” said Anshul Jain, Chief Executive - India, SE Asia & APAC Tenant Representation, Cushman & Wakefield.Additionally, the government plans to promote homeownership by encouraging states to reduce stamp duty rates, particularly for women.“This could significantly reduce the cost of property acquisition in India, a country where stamp duty rates are one of the highest in the world,” said Dhruv Agarwala, Group CEO, Housing.com PropTiger.com.Infrastructural development in tier 2 cities will also provide a fillip to real estate development.“Affordable housing, which has been an area of concern will get a boost through the Rs 10 crore investment in urban housing,” said Prateek Mittal, ED, Sushma Group.The spending on infrastructure, while on the one hand, increasing prosperity, will also boost economic prospects, encouraging both the housing and commercial realty segments.“An allocation of Rs 10 lakh crore in allocation for urban housing will enable affordable housing development.

, especially the revised tax structure and increased standard deduction, aimed at boosting consumer spending and nurturing economic growth. The allocation of an additional 3 crore houses under PM Awas Yojana will provide a significant boost to the market for large consumer durables. The proactive efforts of the government to enhance ease of doing business in the manufacturing sector are evident and commendable. The introduction of new employment incentives across manufacturing and other sectors will not only spur workforce expansion but also bolster the Make in India initiative, complementing existing PLI schemes. However, there was an expectation within the industry for more aggressive measures aimed at increasing disposable income to further stimulate consumer spending.”

Arjun Bajaj, Director - Videotex

“The recent budget has highlighted manufacturing, infrastructure, and innovation as key priorities, signalling a strategic focus on these areas. However, the television manufacturing sector feels somewhat overlooked, as anticipated incentives and support were not fully addressed. Despite this, the budget's emphasis on skilling and workforce development within the manufacturing sector is a positive step, fostering hope for future growth.

This focus on enhancing workforce skills aligns with the goal of positioning India as a global manufacturing hub. The government's commitment to employment and employability is reflected in a ₹1.48 lakh crore provision, which includes incentives for job creation and EPFO contributions aimed at boosting the industrial and manufacturing sectors.

With fiscal support for infrastructure set at 3.4% of GDP, the budget aims to strengthen the foundations necessary for driving growth across various industries, including electronics manufacturing. Improved infrastructure, coupled with a skilled workforce, is expected to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the electronics manufacturing sector, paving the way for sustained industrial growth.”

A. Gururaj, Managing Director, Optiemus Electronics Ltd.

“We welcome the initiatives announced in the Union Budget. The significant emphasis on manufacturing is heart warming and much needed for the growth of the economy. With the substantial expansion of the electronics manufacturing industry, the demand for a skilled workforce has become paramount. The announcement of various skilling initiatives and the scheme to incentivize additional employment in the manufacturing sector, particularly for first-time employees, will provide essential support to industries reliant on skilled workforce, especially in electronics. Furthermore, the proposal to reduce the Basic Customs Duty on mobile phones, mobile PCBA, and mobile chargers to 15% is a positive step. The measures laid out to support the MSME industries are particularly welcome to create a much needed supplier base for electronics within India. These measures collectively send out a strong message on the manufacturing sector and related ecosystem in India.”

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: New income tax slabs, capital gains tax, key tax changes that impact salaried, other taxpayers","The Budget 2024 presented today by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, will impact the personal finance of individuals in multiple ways. Here's a round-up.One of the major updates is the rationalization of the tax rates under the new tax regime, which is expected to bring in a tax savings of up to Rs 17,500 for the taxpayer. Further, the Budget has increased the standard deduction for the salaried and pension receiving taxpayers, to Rs 75,000 from the earlier limit of Rs 50,000. For taxpayers who receive family pension, the deduction has been increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000. The new tax slabs will be applicable from April 1, 2024 i.e for current financial year.The new tax regime in India, introduced in the Union Budget 2020, is a taxation system with lower tax rates compared to the old regime but with a trade-off of forgoing most of the deductions and exemptions. As the default tax regime of the last fiscal, the Budget 2024 revealed that more than 2/3rd of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime. To promote the new tax regime further as well as to encourage retirement savings, the Budget 2024 has enhanced the deduction for contribution by the employer to National Pension Scheme (NPS) of the employee, from 10% of salary to 14% of salary. This benefit was earlier allowed for government employees only.The Budget 2024 has overhauled the provisions relating to capital gains effective 23 July 2024. As regards holding period of the assets for classification into long term or short term, the Budget 2024 proposes to classify all listed financial assets as long term if they are held for more than 12 months and unlisted financial and non-financial assets as long term if they are held for more than 24 months.Further, with a view to promote long term investments over short term speculation, the tax on short term capital gains on sale of equity shares and equity oriented mutual funds is increased to 20% from the existing rate of 15%. Short term capital gains on sale of other assets will continue to be taxed at applicable rates. Further, long term capital gains on financial and non-financial assets are proposed to be taxed at a rate of 12.5% from the existing rate of 10%/20%. In this regard, one needs to note that post Budget 2024, long term capital gain from sale of listed equity shares, units of equity-oriented fund and business trust is taxable only beyond a limit of Rs 1.25 lakh, which has been enhanced from the existing limit of Rs 1 lakh with a view to further incentivize investors to hold onto their investments for a longer period.Currently, Taxes Collected at Source (TCS) by banks and financial institutions apply to foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the Reserve Bank of India and to certain other payments. The amount collected as TCS can be claimed as a credit against the total tax liability of the remitter when filing the tax return. The Budget 2024 has brought in a provision which will allow the taxpayer to declare the TCS to their employers for consideration at the time of withholding taxes (TDS) from salary. This will help ease cash flow issues for taxpayers who currently have to claim a refund of these taxes in their tax returns.The Budget 2024 provides for de-criminalization of defaults in TDS payments by the deductor (e.g employers), so long as the appropriate taxes are remitted within the due date for filing of the TDS statements. This helps reduce the burden on the tax deductor by shifting the focus from prosecution to ensuring timely compliance and payments within stipulated timelines.Further, there is relaxation for Indian professionals working in multi-national corporations who may receive ESOPs and as a result hold shares or invest in social security schemes and other movable assets abroad. Non-reporting of such foreign assets by Ordinary Residents typically had penal consequences under the Black Money Act. The same has been de-penalised in Budget 2024 for cases where the aggregate value of the assets is up to Rs 20 lakh.In relation to assessments, the Budget 2024 has proposed increase in monetary limits for appeal and simplified criteria for re-assessment of income by laying down a minimum period of 3 years and a maximum period of 5 years from the end of the assessment year for initiation of such proceedings. The Government also commits to faster resolution of tax disputes under the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme 2024.The finance minister has promised a comprehensive review of the income tax law within 6 months, to simplify the same with the intention of reducing litigation and provide more clarity and certainty to the taxpayers. Further, given the way the digitization of the Indian economy has impacted taxation, both in terms of how taxes are collected and how they are complied with, the proposed changes to the tax law are expected to make tax compliance more simple and convenient for taxpayers.(Authored by Shalini Jain, Tax Partner, EY India.

While the changes in rates for LTCG and STCG were not anticipated, the markets will take them in their stride,"" said Venkat Chalasani, Chief Executive, AMFI.""Rationalizing capital gains tax is another key theme, affecting different asset classes differently. If the indexation benefits for real estate investments has been removed, it could significantly impact home sellers. The increase in capital gains tax for equity markets and increase in STT on F&O has been met with negative market reactions,"" said Alekh Yadav, Head of Investment Products, Sanctum Wealth.""Taxation on fixed deposits, debt mutual funds, bonds and market-linked bonds was kept unchanged. This was a bit damper for fixed income investors. That said, we don't expect significant change in investor sentiment. Overall, it is a pragmatic Union Budget from the financial market's perspective,” said Dhawal Dalal, President & CIO-Fixed Income, Edelweiss Mutual Fund.""With the marginal increase in LTCG from 10% to 12.5%, long-term investors might be paying slightly higher taxes. However, with the exemption limit raised to Rs 1.25 lakh, small investors will see modest benefits. The increase of STCG from 15% to 20% will impact short-term equity investors. Although the tax rates are marginally increased, equity mutual funds remain an attractive investment opportunity compared to other asset classes. Therefore, we do not anticipate that the change in tax rates will significantly affect the flows towards equity mutual funds,"" said Feroze Azeez, Deputy CEO, Anand Rathi Wealth Limited.“Despite the increase in LTCG to 12.5%, equity mutual funds continue to remain great long term investment options for investors. Governments continued focus on fiscal prudence and infrastructure spend bodes well for the economy. Investors are best served by continuing to focus on their asset allocation and investing regularly and not be swayed by short term market movements,” said Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director - Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India Private Limited.""The increase in long-term equity capital gains tax from 10% to 12.5% has been a deterrent to the markets. India still has low tax rates as compared to other markets Globally. The markets may consider it negatively initially, but considering the future prospects and the potential to make money in India, I think it will be still very insignificant. The Government has also increased the threshold for long-term capital gains exemption from Rs 1 lakh per year to Rs 1.25 lakhs and this is a welcome step. Those investing for the long term could consider capital gains harvesting every year, up to this limit of Rs 1.25 lakhs every year, and reduce the taxation over a long period,"" said Rajesh Minocha, a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), Founder of Financial RadianceHe further added, ""The increase in short-term capital gains tax from 15% to 20% is actually positive.

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Experts laud FM’s announcements to improve exports and production of shrimp,"Delivering the Union Budget 2024 on Tuesday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman took note of India’s rising marine exports and announced a slew of measures to improve export competitiveness in this segment.India’s seafood exports in the last financial year touched an all-time high of Rs 60,000 crore, with frozen shrimp accounting for two-thirds of these, she said. “I propose to reduce BCD (basic customs duty) on certain broodstock, polychaete worms, shrimp and fish feed to 5%. I also propose to exempt customs duty on various inputs for manufacture of shrimp and fish feed,” she said.Earlier, the inputs for shrimp and feed fish manufacturing — such as krill meal, fish lipid oil, arude fish oil, algal prime (flour) and algal oil — had custom duties of 5-30%. These will now be nil.To improve shrimp production and export, the FM announced that financial support will be provided for setting up a network of nucleus breeding centres for shrimp broodstocks. In addition to this, financing for shrimp farming, processing and export will be facilitated through the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.Aditya Dash, MD, Ram's Assorted Cold Storage Limited, a seafood processing/exports company of Suryo Group of Companies, said the budget proposals are positive and attractive for the shrimp sector. “The breeding centres and finance for shrimp farming, processing and export through NABARD feels encouraging. We have been facing issues regarding working capital, so this announcement is helpful. Removing basic custom duties on input materials will definitely encourage and optimise shrimp exports. However, there is still a need for a lot of clarity and more details. Hopefully the implementation will be thorough and fruitful,” he said.Yogesh Gupta, MD, Megaa Moda have found it a welcome move, especially for shrimp farmers. He mentioned that shrimp farmers have been facing harships because of high cost of production and low selling prices.""Therefore, the cuts in the BCD is definitely going to help them. The situation has been very precarious for this sector for almost last 2-3 years. Regarding growth in exports, we have to wait and evaluate as to how much such duty reduction will convert to better marketing in the world market, especially with tough competition with other countries like Equador and Indonesia,"" he said.He added that Capex funding through NABARD is an encouraging move and if implementation is simple, it will result in further growth.Pushkar Mukewar, CEO and Co-founder of Drip Capital, pointed out that reducing BCD on key inputs such as rootstock, worms, shrimp, and fish feed to 5% will lower production costs for seafood exporters and incentivise value addition in these industries. “These initiatives will create a more favourable business environment, driving export growth and economic prosperity. We look forward to working with our clients to maximise these policy benefits and contribute to India's export success,"" he said.In FY2023-24, India exported seafood worth Rs 60,523.89 crore ($7.38 billion) in value and 1,781,602 tonnes in quantity. This was a 2.67% increase in quantity from the previous year. However, in terms of value it saw a slight decline with exports of Rs 63,969.14 crore ($ 8.09 billion) in 2022-23. India’s top importers of seafood last fiscal year were the United States and China.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-fm-announces-plan-to-set-up-breeding-centres-for-shrimp-cuts-duty-to-improve-exports/articleshow/111955263.cms

Increase in amount allowed as deduction to non-government employers and their employees for employer contribution to a Pension Scheme referred in section 80CCD



Section 36 of the Act pertains to other deductions allowed while computing the income under the head ‘Profits and gains of business or profession’. Clause (iva) of sub-section (1) of said section states that any sum paid by the assessee as an employer by way of contribution towards a pension scheme, as referred to in section 80CCD of the Act, on account of an employee, to the extent it does not exceed ten per cent of the salary of the employee in the previous year, shall be allowed as a deduction to the employer.

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024 can be a big opportunity for government to showcase its commitment to education,"The budget of 2024, being presented just before the 4th anniversary of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, 29th July, would be a great opportunity for the government to showcase its commitment to the cause of education in the country. The NDA government, in its third term now, can utilise the opportunity to leave its legacy on the education system in the country.The NEP released in its second term was visionary and in the right direction. However, the follow up on this can be seen to be wanting. While incremental steps have been taken in the previous 2 or 3 budgets, no specific actions that can be said to have really transformed the sector have yet been taken.One can say that the government has its task cutout on two fronts. It urgently needs to increase the reach and effectiveness of the universities at the ground level. It also needs to ensure that the country's premier institutions work their way to becoming truly world class.It is no secret that many students graduating from the thousands of graduate programs of universities across the country are almost unemployable. Ensuring that their employability levels are improved is the urgent primary task facing our education system. Laudable steps like setting up e-labs for vocational skill development announced in the previous budgets are in line with this goal. However, ensuring that these steps bear fruit in the shortest time possible and sustain themselves on a continuous basis is the need of the hour.This would need not just higher budget allocations, which are much lower than the levels advocated by the NEP itself, but also a lot more scrutiny and accountability on those responsible for delivering these at the ground level. If this is not done, the steps lose steam very soon, making us lose not only the resources invested in them but also, valuable time. We need to remember that those graduating and seeking employment would remain unskilled for that much longer. This hurts both the individuals and the industry.While providing better skills for the students is the primary goal, effectiveness of teachers is an equally important aspect that directly impacts the achievability of this goal. Poor teacher quality is unfortunately a reason why many of our graduates remain where they are, making this one of the key and high priority aspects to be targeted. Initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0, and revamping teacher training, which have been announced last year are welcome steps in this direction. However, the proof of the pudding here also is to ensure that the initiatives announced are followed through to effectiveness and longevity. Presently, sadly, that is not happening.Hardly any Indian Universities feature in the top rungs of the global rankings. This makes for a very sad comparison with a country like China which are miles ahead of us on this important regard.Lagging behind on this parameter has two major disadvantages. The first is that we lose our best brains to top universities abroad. This effects our R&D capabilities in the both the short and long runs – we have been experiencing this for over the last century. It is high time to try and put a stop to this. The second disadvantage is that we will not be able to attract foreign students, a valuable source of foreign currency, into the country. The US attracted over a million students into its universities, in the academic year 2022/23. These students contributed more than $40 billion to its economy. Not having world-class institutes, hence, becomes a double whammy, making this a key aspect to focus on urgent.We hope that the government takes concrete steps, not just incremental ones, to address these issues in its budget this year.The author is Founder & Director, T.I.M.E.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-can-be-a-big-opportunity-for-government-to-showcase-its-commitment-to-education/articleshow/111945351.cms

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: Big tax shake-up for property sellers, buyers","NEW DELHI: The Union Budget 2024 has introduced changes to the taxation of long-term capital gains (LTCG) arising from the sale of property. The indexation benefit , which allowed property owners to adjust their purchase price for inflation, has been removed. Instead, a new LTCG tax rate of 12.5% will be applied to the capital gains on the sale of property, without considering the indexation benefit.Here is an example from an Economic Time report. To illustrate the impact of this change, consider the following example: Mr A purchased a property for Rs 25 lakh in the financial year 2002-2003 and sells it for Rs 1 crore in the financial year 2023-2024. Under the previous rules, the purchase price of Rs 25 lakh would have been adjusted using the Cost Inflation Index (CII) numbers provided by the Income Tax Department . However, with the new rule in effect, the capital gains will be calculated by directly subtracting the purchase price from the sale price, without any inflation adjustment.Amit Goyal, Managing Director of India Sotheby's International Realty, welcomes this change, saying, ""For real estate transaction, bringing down the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5% is a welcome step, even if it comes with removal of indexation benefits. This will encourage more liquidity in property transactions. Higher uniformity in long term capital gains tax across different asset classes was a long standing ask of investors.""As per the ET report, the finance minister, in her budget speech for 2024, explained the rationale behind this change, saying, ""simultaneously with rationalisation of rate to 12.5%, indexation available under second proviso to section 48 is proposed to be removed for calculation of any long-term capital gains which is presently available for property, gold and other unlisted assets. This will ease computation of capital gains for the taxpayer and the tax administration.""The Cost Inflation Index (CII) is a figure published annually by the Income Tax Department to calculate indexation benefits. It is used to determine the inflation-adjusted cost of a long-term capital asset, which is then subtracted from the sale price to arrive at the taxable capital gain. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has notified the CII for the financial year 2024-25 (Assessment Year 2025-26) as 363, while the CII for the previous financial year 2023-24 (Assessment Year 2024-25) was 348.(With inputs from agencies)",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/big-real-estate-shake-up-union-budget-removed-indexation-benefit-but-cuts-ltcg-tax/articleshow/111956374.cms

Shares of stock broking companies were in focus on Tuesday after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on F&O transactions in her Union Budget speech.The FM has increased the rates of STT on the sale of an option in securities from 0.0625% to 0.1% of the option premium and on the sale of futures in securities from 0.0125% to 0.02% of the price at which such futures are traded.Further, the short-term gains on certain financial assets will attract a tax of 20%, while that on all other financial assets and all non-financial assets will continue to attract the applicable tax rate.The long-term gains on all financial and non-financial assets, on the other hand, will attract a tax rate of 12.5%, however, the limit of exemption of capital gains on certain financial assets has been increased to Rs 1.25 lakh per year.“The Union Budget's unexpected increase in both long-term and short-term capital gains taxes has sent shockwaves through the market. This move, coupled with a hike in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) for F&O trading, is a significant blow to the already beleaguered broking industry. The government's stated concern about channeling household savings into the capital market, as outlined in the Economic Survey, seems to have materialized in this policy decision,” said Sonam Srivastava, smallcase Manager and Founder, of Wright Research.The increase in STT on derivatives is seen as a positive step by some analysts toward curbing excessive speculation in futures and options (F&O) markets.“The anticipated adjustments to the capital gains tax were implemented, addressing a significant need. The gap between short-term and long-term capital gains has widened from 5% to 7.5%, which will enhance government revenue from personal income tax,” said Sunil Damania, Chief Investment Officer, MojoPMS.""While STT has been increased on both Futures and Options from 1st October 2024, this is the same date when exchange turnover charges will be reduced. In my view, the net impact of this will be largely net neutral for the customer. For example, STT on Options will increase by Rs 3.75 per ₹10,000 round trip premium turnover while exchange turnover charges should reduce by approx Rs 3.50 to Rs 4,"" said Ashish Nanda, President and Head of Digital Business at Kotak Securities, while commenting on the increased rate of STT.Following the Budget speech, shares of broking stocks like Angel One and Motilal Oswal increased 2% to Rs 543 and 7% to Rs 2,253 respectively, while shares of ICICI Securities were trading flat at Rs 779.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/budget-2024-broking-stocks-may-drag-after-increase-in-stt/articleshow/111957590.cms

MUMBAI: The religious tourism destinations in Bihar took centre stage in the 2024-25 union budget as the finance minister announced initiatives for development of Vishnupad temple corridor at Gaya, Mahabodhi temple at Bodh Gaya and revival of Rajgir, a popular place of worship for hindus, buddhists and jains.Among the other initiatives announced for the tourism sector were the revival of Nalanda University , assistance for Odisha tourism development and a simple tax regime for foreign shipping companies that undertake domestic cruise tourism in India.The budget was not received well by the travel and tourism industry insiders, who said the main issues concerning the sector such as issues with GST levy and TCS on outbound travel were ignored.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech said: “Tourism has always been a part of our civilization. Our efforts in positioning India as a global tourist destination will also create jobs, stimulate investments and unlock economic opportunities for other sectors”.“Comprehensive development of Vishnupad Temple Corridor and Mahabodhi Temple Corridor will be supported, modelled on the successful Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor, to transform them into world class pilgrim and tourist destinations”, she said. Speaking about Rajgir, Sitharaman said, the place holds immense religious significance for hindus, buddhists and jains. The 20th Tirthankara Munisuvrata temple in the Jain Temple complex is ancient. She also added that the Saptharishi or the 7 hotsprings form a warm water Brahmakund that is sacred. The union minister stated that a comprehensive development initiative for Rajgir will be undertaken. She further added that the government will support the development of Nalanda as a tourist centre besides reviving Nalanda University to its glorious stature.The minister spoke about the potential to boost tourism in Odisha given its scenic beauty, temples, monuments, craftsmanship, wildlife sanctuaries, natural landscapes and pristine beaches. “Our government will provide assistance for their development”, she added.Jay Bhatia, vice president, Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) said that the finance minister in her budget speech has “once again ignored the travel trade in India.”“The FM in her speech highlighted infrastructure development for only two to three religious locations…These religious circuits are totally raw and need a huge push. Rather than upgrading the current locations and enhancing last mile connectivity to popular locations the government is trying to push locations where connectivity is a huge challenge and there is lack of interest in the domestic as well as the inbound tourism market,” said TAAI.In its pre-budget expectations sent to the FM, TAAI had sought reduction in aviation turbine fuel prices in order to bring down airfares and boost tourist volumes. “Requests for rationalisation of GST rates for inbound, outbound as well as domestic travel doesn’t seem to be of importance to the government. TAAI has made multiple demands to permit GST input credit for interstate hotel rates which would thereby allow the hotels as well as passengers to avail of input credits in their businesses,” it said.Another prominent issue was TCS on outbound travel. TAAI said it had brought to the notice of the government that this particular norm was hindering the ease of doing business for Indian travel agents and tour operators. More importantly, it increased the competition with global players from overseas who do not have to levy GST or TCS to their clients. “Inbound and Outbound Tourism go hand in hand and to increase inbound, outbound tourism too must increase. TCS puts a spoke in the outbound tourism traffic as the travellers funds are blocked,” TAAI said.Ajay Prakash, president of Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) said none of the issues that plague the travel industry such as GST or TCS were addressed. “There were no sector specific incentives or inducements to promote this industry. So we can talk about the potential in tourism, but it will remain unrealised if this is the attitude of government towards tourism,” said Prakash.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-boosts-bihars-religious-tourism-but-neglects-core-travel-industry-issues-travel-agents-association-of-india/articleshow/111959018.cms

'Household Budget Impacts...': What Indian Women Expect From Modi Govt | Watch

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget for 2024-25 on July 23, marking her historic seventh consecutive budget speech. This unprecedented achievement surpasses the previous record held by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai. The budget, a critical document for shaping India’s economic future, encompasses diverse sectors including FMCG, real estate, technology, and notably, travel and tourism.India is not far away from being the premier global travel destination and the 2024 budget unveils a range of impactful initiatives that can help the respective sector achieve this goal.Influential figures across different sectors have weighed in with their perspectives and shared what are their expectations from the Union Budget 2024-25.Ahsan Shervani, Vice President of Star Hotels Pvt Ltd, expressed support for the increased allocation of approximately ₹2,450 crores to the travel sector. He stated, ""We welcome the allocation of approximately ₹2,450 crores to the sector, marking a 44.7% increase from previous estimates. This funding aims to enhance employment and stimulate tourism growth which is a welcomed move. As an industry, we are still eagerly looking for a bit more rationalization in the GST structure for hotels and grant of infrastructure status to the industry.""Rajesh Magow, Co-founder & Group CEO of MakeMyTrip, praised the government's focus on infrastructure development. He remarked, ""The government's continued emphasis on infrastructure development is commendable. Enhanced road infrastructure will bolster the travel and tourism sector . We also welcome the initiatives to develop iconic spiritual and cultural sites into world-class tourist hotspots. The decision to reduce the TDS rate on e-commerce operators to 0.1% is a welcome move. Furthermore, the provision of credit for TCS against income tax under 'Income from Salaries' is logical and will provide much-desired relief to taxpayers who travel internationally.""Sachin Maheshwary, General Manager of Novotel Goa Resort & Spa and Novotel Goa Candolim, highlighted the need for innovation in the hospitality sector. ""Hoteliers expect budgets to prioritize innovative technology, like AI-driven customer service and smart room features to enhance guest experiences. With an increase in digital dominance, marketing budgets will pivot heavily towards digital, leveraging social media influencers and virtual tours to capture the digital-savvy traveler market. Guests today tend to expect fresh experiences; therefore, budgets will increasingly support immersive guest experiences like themed stays, local cultural events, and personalized services, catering to the demand for experiential tourism. This tourism brings in a plethora of people from different backgrounds and with eco-conscious travelers on the rise, budgets are allocated towards practices like locally sourced F&B options and energy-efficient infrastructures,” said Sachin“It is easy to think about just infrastructure, but recognizing that great service begins with great staff is important. As a result, an increase in budgets for training and employee well-being programs to attract and retain top talent is looked forward to. At the end of all of these new and unique qualities, post-pandemic realities are not forgotten and will keep health and safety measures a budget priority, with investments in hygiene technology and wellness programs,"" he added.Animesh Kumar, Head of Commercials at ibis & ibis Styles India, praised the budget’s emphasis on tourism infrastructure. He said, ""It is highly encouraging to see that the Hon’ble Finance Minister has underscored the vital role of tourism in driving our economy and boosting employment and GDP. The enhanced focus on developing tourism corridors at Vishnupad Temple and Mahabodhi Temple, modeled after the successful Kashi Vishwanath Temple initiative, will significantly contribute to tourism growth during the Amrit Kal. Additionally, the government's support for transforming Nalanda in Bihar into a major tourist destination is a noteworthy step forward. Finance Minister Sitharaman's announcement of an economic policy framework aimed at ushering in next-generation reforms to drive economic growth further underscores this commitment. The Union Budget’s robust allocation of Rs 11.11 lakh crore for capital expenditure also highlights a strong commitment to infrastructure development.”He also mentioned that to fully harness the potential of the hospitality sector and further enhance tourism, the government needed to consider more lenient tax policies and allocate a substantial budget to elevate hotel standards. “We are optimistic that future support from the Government will include granting infrastructure status to the hospitality and tourism sectors, which will help us achieve long-awaited progress and drive sustained growth,"" Kumar mentioned.Aloke Bajpai, Chairman, Managing Director & Group CEO of ixigo, welcomed the focus on spiritual tourism. He noted, ""The government's policy initiatives to enhance spiritual tourism are a welcome move towards growing domestic tourism as well as making India a global travel destination. We saw a 40-50% increase in demand for spiritual tourism last year, for destinations like Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Tirupati. The government’s PRASAD Scheme has led to a remarkable transformation in Varanasi's tourism sector, attracting an unprecedented 100 million visitors to Kashi Vishwanath Dham after the corridor project completion. We expect a similar boost in tourism to Bihar and Odisha with spiritual tourism corridors coming up for Vishnupad Temple and Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, along with comprehensive initiatives for Rajgir, Nalanda, and Odisha.”He further added, “We expect this to benefit our large next billion user (NBU) base which predominantly relies on buses and trains to access these spiritual towns, and where our market share continues to improve across modes of transport.""Sudip Ghose, Founder & MD of Uppercase, emphasized the need for sustainability in the travel industry. He said, ""It's an exciting time for the luggage industry as more and more travelers prioritize sustainability in their purchasing decisions. Consumers today are increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of their travel choices, and they're actively seeking out eco-friendly luggage options. This shift in consumer preferences presents a tremendous opportunity for our industry to innovate and lead the way in sustainable travel solutions.”On the other hand, he highlighted that to truly accelerate this positive trend, one needs support from the government. Thus, he is hopeful the 2024 Union Budget will prioritize policies and incentives that encourage luggage companies to go green. “Tax rebates and subsidies for investments in eco-friendly materials, manufacturing processes, and product design would go a long way in making sustainable luggage more accessible and affordable for the average consumer. This could catalyze breakthroughs in areas like biodegradable plastics, renewable fibers, and other innovations that would transform the way people travel,"" he quoted.Nikhil Sharma, Managing Director and Area Senior Vice President - South Asia at Radisson Hotel Group, seemed elated by the government's efforts to boost domestic tourism. He said, ""We welcome the Union Budget 2024-2025, which focuses on positioning India as a global tourism hub through progressive initiatives. The surge in spiritual tourism has been recognized, and we are excited to see the sector receiving much-needed support in this year’s budget. The development of road connectivity projects, with a special emphasis on spiritual and cultural corridors, underscores the Government of India’s commitment to fueling the growth of the country's rich cultural and spiritual network of tourism. At Radisson Hotel Group, we have always focused on Tier II and III cities, leveraging a first-mover advantage with 50% of our portfolio in these regions. Our strategic commitment to these destinations aligns with the government’s vision, allowing us to meet the increasing demand for spiritual experiences and further strengthen our presence across India. We are optimistic that this development will not only propel the domestic tourism sector but will also provide an opportunity for foreign tourists to further explore the rich culture of India.""Dharamveer Singh Chouhan, Co-Founder & CEO of Zo World, expressed enthusiasm about the budget's impact on tourism. He said, ""The Union budget for the Financial year 2024-25 marks a significant boost for the tourism industry, underscoring the government's commitment to transform India into a preferred global destination for tourists. The budget has allocated substantial resources to develop and enhance tourist infrastructure, including scenic landscapes, historic temples, cultural heritage sites, wildlife sanctuaries, and pristine beaches across the country. The government has announced its intention to preserve cultural landmarks, improve accessibility, and promote diverse tourist attractions through comprehensive development programs. This is highly encouraging for pioneers behind new-age techno-cultural movements. These initiatives are designed to create jobs, attract investments, and stimulate economic growth in related sectors such as hospitality, retail, and transportation. The overarching goal is to leverage India's rich cultural and natural heritage to drive sustainable tourism and enhance India's position as a global superpower. The strategy also puts the spotlight on tourism as ""the"" industry that will enable both cultural preservation and long-term economic growth, while simultaneously championing the cause of diverse communities around the country. These measures are commendable and will undoubtedly boost confidence in both hospitality and tourism as lucrative startup sectors.""""At the same time, the Zo World community remains optimistic about enhancements that can propel this vision at least 10x, such as tax reductions for the hospitality industry (to encourage entrepreneurial strides in this direction), subsidies for startups that will contribute directly to the tourism sector, increased support for digital transformation in hospitality services, and additional funding allocation that will help market India's diverse tourist destinations on the global stage. Zo is excited to align its plans with such initiatives on a national scale, leveraging the enhanced infrastructure and increased tourism to expand its techno-optimistic hospitality footprint and offer truly unique & future-ready experiences across the map,"" he added.Raoof Dhanani, Managing Director, Sayaji Hotels Ltd. also shared his insight and appreciated the initiatives of the government for offering a transformative opportunity. “The 2024 Union Budget presents a transformative opportunity for the travel and tourism industry, underscoring the government's commitment to enhancing infrastructure and promoting sustainable growth. The proposed infrastructure status for hotels is a crucial step toward increasing the supply of branded accommodations, which is essential for attracting both domestic and international tourists. Additionally, the rationalization of Goods and Services Tax (GST) and modifications to the Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) will further stimulate domestic travel, encouraging more Indians to explore diverse destinations across the country,” he quoted.“With initiatives like 'Swadesh Darshan' aimed at developing iconic tourist sites, we anticipate a significant boost in domestic tourism, potentially generating an economic impact of Rs 10,000-15,000 crore. This budget not only aims to create jobs in hotels, restaurants, and transportation but also emphasizes the importance of promoting lesser-known destinations to alleviate pressure on popular sites. As we look ahead, the travel industry is optimistic that these strategic measures will position India as a premier global travel destination, fostering resilience and growth in the sector,"" concluded Raoof Dhanani.The 2024 Union Budget signifies a major step forward for India’s travel and tourism sector, with its focus on infrastructure, spiritual tourism, and sustainability. As industry leaders await the practical implementation of these measures, the potential for growth and innovation in India’s travel industry appears promising.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-industry-leaders-share-their-insights-on-the-future-of-the-travel-sector-based-on-fund-allocation-infrastructure-development-and-other-major-initiatives/articleshow/111963340.cms

indiatimes.com,STT on F&Os hiked in Budget 2024; check updated tax rates here,"

Finance Minister Nirmala Sithraman on Tuesday proposed to increase the rate of securities transaction tax (STT) on futures and options (F&O) trade to discourage retail investors ' participation in the risky instrument. ""It is proposed to increase the rates of STT on the sale of an option in securities from 0.0625 per cent to 0.1 per cent of the option premium, and on sale of a futures in securities from 0.0125 per cent to 0.02 per cent of the price at which such futures are traded,"" she said in the Union Budget speech.This came after the Economic Survey flagged concerns over rising retail investors' interest in derivative trading. The survey stated that speculative trade has no place in a developing country.It also pointed out that the sharp increase in retail investor participation in F&O trading is likely driven by humans' gambling instincts ""Derivatives trading holds the potential for outsized gains. Thus, it caters to humans' gambling instincts and can augment income if profitable. These considerations are likely driving active retail participation in derivatives trading,"" according to the Economic Survey 2023-24.Recently, Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch also cautioned investors against heavy bets on F&O. Before that, Sitharaman and chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran flagged the growing risk of F&O trading for retail investors.F&O trading continues to grow in popularity, and market experts believe that this is driven by the potential for profit and the rising trading volumes. Experts said investors who lack understanding or risk appetite should avoid derivatives trading.The segment's popularity is evident from its massive growth, with the monthly turnover in the F&O segment reaching Rs 8,740 lakh crore in March 2024, compared to Rs 217 lakh crore in March 2019.At the same time, the average daily turnover in the equity cash segment was Rs 1 lakh crore, while the F&O segment saw an average daily turnover of about Rs 330 lakh crore.Futures and Options trading involves contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset, such as stocks or commodities. Futures contracts obligate the buyer and seller to transact at a predetermined future date and price, while options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the asset at a set price within a specific period.These financial instruments are used for hedging risks, speculating on price movements, and arbitraging price differences. However, they come with significant risks, including leverage risk and market volatility, which can lead to substantial losses.Futures and Options trading is largely being utilised as a speculative tool for quick profits in the stock market. However, the reality is that most retail investors are losing money.A study by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) revealed that 89 per cent of individual traders in the equity F&O segment suffered losses, with average losses of Rs 1.1 lakh in FY22.Additionally, there was an exponential increase in the F&O segment participation during the pandemic, with the total number of unique individual traders increasing by over 500 per cent from 7.1 lakh in FY19 to 45.24 lakh in FY21, the study noted.Earlier, Buch stated that the capital markets regulator is ""compelled"" to warn against speculative bets in the F&O segment because it has become a ""macro issue"", affecting the broader economy now.Household financial savings are going into the speculative bets, belying the expectations of being used for capital formation, and the youth is losing tonnes of money in such trades, she stated.Last month, the Sebi board approved stricter norms for the entry of individual stocks in the derivatives segment. The proposal is aimed at weeding out stocks with consistently low turnover from the F&O segment of the bourses.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/stt-on-fos-hiked-in-budget-2024-check-updated-tax-rates-here/articleshow/111953507.cms

indiatimes.com,Union Budget 2024-25: Beleaguered Andhra Pradesh gets funds for crucial projects,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman announced in the budget that the central government has recognized the need for a capital in Andhra Pradesh.

VIJAYAWADA: The financially beleaguered state of Andhra Pradesh received a major boost in the union budget with the announcement of Rs 15,000 crore financial assistance for the capital, Amaravati .Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman announced in the budget that the central government has recognized the need for a capital in Andhra Pradesh and will facilitate special funding through multilateral agencies.Sitaraman also announced financial help for Polavaram , special grants to backward districts, and funds for Kopparthi and Orvakal industrial nodes.This financial assistance comes as a shot in the arm for Andhra Pradesh, which is in a dire financial situation. The greenfield capital city, Amaravati, was planned and designed post-bifurcation of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh by the then TDP government but was abandoned by the previous YSRC government for the last five years.Though the TDP-led NDA government has come back to power, the government is facing a severe crunch of funds to restart the works. During the earlier tenure of the TDP, works to the tune of Rs 9,617 crore were launched, but only works worth Rs 1,958 crore were executed. Financial assistance from the center is much needed for the completion of Amaravati.According to the State Reorganisation Act, the union government must provide financial assistance to the newly formed state of Andhra Pradesh. Between 2014 and 2019, only Rs 1,500 crore were given for the creation of essential infrastructure in Amaravati. Out of the Rs 1,500 crore, Rs 1,000 crore was given to the stormwater drainage system in Vijayawada and the underground drainage system in Guntur.After ten years of state bifurcation, the union government has made a major fund allocation, which is ten times the earlier allotment. Apart from Amaravati, the Polavaram project also receives renewed assurance from the union government, as Nirmala Sitaraman stated that they are committed to fully financing the project and also to its early completion.Another promise made in the reorganization Act was to give special grants on the lines of the Bundelkhand package to the backward districts of Rayalaseema and North Andhra. Though Rs 50 crore funds per district per year were given for four years after 2014, it was stopped for various reasons.Nirmala Sitaraman announced that special grants will be given to these districts again in the budget speech, which will help the state government to take up infrastructure-building works in backward areas.The union government also promised funds to Kopparthi and Orvakal industrial nodes as part of the development of the Visakhapatnam–Chennai and Bangalore–Hyderabad industrial corridors.",Center,Center,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/union-budget-2024-25-beleaguered-andhra-pradesh-gets-funds-for-crucial-projects/articleshow/111953456.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024 Live Updates: Amit Shah hails internship programme decision as 'game-changing move',"19:19 (IST) Jul 23

Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy has sharply criticised the Union budget 2024-25, alleging that it reflects a biased attitude towards Telangana. Speaking at a press conference, Reddy expressed frustration over what he perceives as neglect and injustice towards his state.



""Today's Union budget shows the attitude of the Centre towards Telangana,"" Reddy stated. Despite multiple visits to Delhi and meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top leaders, Reddy claimed that justice was not served. He emphasized that the budget failed to allocate funds for crucial projects in Telangana, such as the metro, RRR road, and the ITIR corridor project.



Reddy pointed out that while funds were allocated to Andhra Pradesh, Telangana received no financial support in the budget. ""Not a single rupee was given for metro, RRR road, or other key projects in Telangana. Even the ITIR corridor project was not mentioned,"" he said. Reddy criticized the budget as a ""kursi bachao"" budget, suggesting it was designed merely to protect the Prime Minister's position rather than address the needs of Telangana.



He also called for accountability from Union minister G Kishan Reddy, demanding that he apologize to the people of Telangana and resign from his cabinet position. ""Union minister G Kishan Reddy should answer about the injustice done to Telangana. He should apologize to the people of Telangana and resign from the cabinet,"" Reddy asserted.



Reddy announced that eight Congress MPs from Telangana would join other MPs in protesting against the budget. He urged all legislators, including the BJP MPs and AIMIM MP, to participate in the protest. ""The AP Reorganisation Act is not only about providing funds for Andhra Pradesh but also about Telangana. In the Legislative Assembly, we will discuss this injustice after the Question Hour,"" he added.



The Chief Minister concluded by accusing the NDA government of exhibiting bias against Telangana. ""The NDA means 'Naidu-Nitish Dependent Alliance',"" Reddy said, suggesting that the central government's decisions are influenced by political alliances rather than the needs of the state.

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: FM announces Rs 2 lakh cr package for five job schemes, skilling for 4 crore youth","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday announced a slew of initiatives to boost skilling and jobs in her seventh consecutive Union Budget . Sitharaman announced a Rs 2 lakh crore package for five schemes which are aimed at creating jobs and providing skilling to 4.1 crore youth in the country.The FM also announced a package for employment and skilling and 3 schemes for “Employment Linked Incentive” — Scheme A for first timers; Scheme B for job creation in manufacturing; and Scheme C to give support to employers.Scheme A for first times is direct benefit transfer of 1-month salary in 3 installments of up to Rs 15,000 for first time employers registered under EPFO. Scheme B for job creation in manufacturing is about incentives to be provided to both employees and employers as per their EPFO contribution in the first four years of employment. Scheme C is about reimbursement to employers for up to Rs 3,000 per month for 2 years towards their EPFO contribution towards their each additional employee.She also talked about job creation in manufacturing to incentivise employees and employers with respect to the EPFO contribution. Twenty lakh youth will be skilled under the new centrally sponsored scheme, said Sitharaman.The Finance Minister also announced that Model Skill Loan Scheme will be revised to facilitate loans up to Rs 7.5 lakh with a guarantee from a government-promoted fund. It is expected to help nearly 25,000 students each year.The Budget 2024-25 also proposed revision of the Model Skill Loan Scheme to help 25,000 students every year. “E-vouchers for loans of up to Rs 10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions to be given directly to 1 lakh students every year for annual interest subvention of 3% of loan amount,” said Sitharaman.Commenting on the announcements, Ramesh Alluri Reddy, CEO at TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship, said, ""The Union Budget 2024 's renewed thrust on job creation is both timely and commendable. With the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announcing that one crore youth will receive internship opportunities in the top 500 companies, with an allowance of Rs 5000 per month and Rs 6000 as one-time assistance. This significant investment in skill development programs and the incentivization of industries to adopt comprehensive apprenticeships lays a solid foundation for a future-ready workforce. Integrating on-the-job training (OJT) as a mandated component of degrees, in collaboration with industry partners, allows students to gain invaluable practical experience, even if the training is not necessarily on-site. This initiative is a welcome move towards formal job creation, bridging the gap between theoretical education and real-world application, making graduates more job-ready. """"While the introduction of employment-linked incentives and a Rs 2 lakh crore allocation for job creation is noteworthy, the framework for skill development remains insufficient. A more robust approach to job-ready education and targeted training programs is essential to bridge the growing employability gap, particularly in high-demand sectors like AI and renewable energy. Additionally, the budget lacks a comprehensive strategy to address the potential job displacement caused by AI advancements. A proactive approach, including retraining programs and direct benefit transfers for affected workers, could have been beneficial. While the Union Budget 2024 lays a strong foundation for growth, it is imperative that the government prioritizes effective implementation and creates synergies across sectors,"" said Mukul Goyal, Co founder, Stratefix Consulting.Shreevardhan Sinha, Senior Partner, Desai & Diwanji, said, ""The 2024-25 Union budget proposals relating to skilling have the potential to significantly impact India's workforce and economy by enhancing employability, fostering economic growth, and promoting inclusive development. Effective implementation and continuous evaluation will be key to realising these benefits and ensuring that skilling programs meet the evolving needs of the economy.""Madhav Krishna, CEO and Founder of Vahan.ai , said, “The Government earmarking a provision of ₹1.48 lakh crores for education, employment and skilling is commendable. Budgetary support and focus on skilling initiatives are essential to ensure that the youth of the country are employable. Such skilling programs should also keep in mind the nature of future jobs, which will arise in the future due to the advancement of technology and AI, and ensure that the youth are equipped and upskilled for the same as well. Additionally, the reforms in the factors of production as promised could greatly incentivise entrepreneurship and lead to greater economic development.""Meanwhile, this Union Budget is the first full financial budget of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in its third successive term.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-fm-announces-rs-2-lakh-cr-package-for-five-job-schemes-skilling-for-4-crore-youth/articleshow/111949481.cms

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Budget 2024 has introduced a significant increase in the standard deduction limit , providing greater tax relief for salaried individuals and pensioners. Here's a detailed look at the changes and their implications.In a move aimed at boosting tax savings , the Finance Minister announced that the standard deduction limit under the new tax regime will be raised to Rs 75,000 for the current financial year, as per ET report.Additionally, the standard deduction for family pensioners has been increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000.This adjustment marks the first increase in the standard deduction limit in five years. The last adjustment occurred in the Interim Budget of 2019, when the limit was raised to Rs 50,000, effective from April 1, 2019.The hike in standard deduction will benefit salaried individuals and pensioners by reducing their taxable income, thereby lowering their tax liability. The standard deduction is a fixed amount that taxpayers can deduct from their gross income without needing to provide detailed expense proofs.The new standard deduction of Rs 75,000 will be applicable under the new tax regime, while family pensioners will benefit from a higher deduction of Rs 25,000. It’s important to note that this standard deduction is available to individuals receiving salary or pension income. However, it does not apply to annuity payments from insurance companies, which are taxable under ""Income from Other Sources.""Claiming the standard deduction is straightforward. Taxpayers do not need to submit any additional documentation to claim this deduction. It is automatically applied based on the salary or pension income reported in the income tax return.The standard deduction was first introduced in the Income-tax Act of 1961, allowing a deduction of Rs 30,000 or 40% of salary (whichever was lower) for individuals with an annual income up to Rs 5 lakh. For those earning above Rs 5 lakh, the standard deduction was set at Rs 20,000. This deduction was withdrawn from the financial year 2005-06.The standard deduction was reintroduced in Budget 2018 as a replacement for medical reimbursement and transport allowance, which were previously available deductions. Initially set at Rs 40,000, the deduction amount was increased to Rs 50,000 in the Interim Budget of 2019.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-is-the-latest-standard-deduction-limit-post-budget-2024-check-hike-under-new-tax-regime/articleshow/111960973.cms

Amit Khatri, Co-Founder, Noise

""The Union

Budget 2024

presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is a visionary step towards inclusive growth, with a strong emphasis on manufacturing, upskilling, and women empowerment. Youth and participation of women in the workforce hold the key to India’s success. To this end, the focus on extensive training and skill development initiatives demonstrates a clear commitment to boosting employability and productivity. By linking job creation in manufacturing to first-time workers and offering EPFO incentives, the government is paving the way for a robust manufacturing ecosystem, creating 4 crore jobs over the next five years. It is certainly a commendable initiative to boost local manufacturing. Additionally, offering internship opportunities in the top 500 companies to 1 crore youth is a strategic move that will equip our young population with the skills and experience necessary to thrive in a competitive global economy.

The establishment of e-commerce export hubs in a PPP model is another significant step taken by the government and will significantly empower MSMEs and traditional artisans to compete internationally. It will open opportunities for Indian players to boost their reach globally while enhancing the ease of doing business and accessing new markets. India has long been an attractive consumer market for international brands, supported by our collaborative and business-friendly policies that enable seamless operations. The export hubs are an efficient step in unlocking similar avenues for homegrown companies, allowing a global stage for their innovation and entrepreneurial mindset, and strengthening India’s position in manufacturing.

Lastly, I feel the abolition of the angel tax will undoubtedly boost funding in the startup ecosystem, fueling innovation and growth. This move, along with incentives for job creation in the manufacturing sector and support for MSMEs, will not only stimulate valuable employment opportunities for millions of young people but also ensure economic resilience, laying a strong foundation for a powerful growth trajectory for India. Driven by the vision of Viksit Bharat, we look forward to actively participating in the nation's journey towards global prominence and innovation leadership.""

Varun Gupta, Co-Founder, Boult

""We’re thrilled about the Finance Minister’s recent announcement to simplify FDI rules and make things easier for investors. This is a big win for the Indian startup scene and will definitely bring in more investment, drive innovation, and boost growth.

The removal of the angel tax is great news for early-stage startups and shows the government's support for startup funding. The focus on creating jobs, developing skills, supporting MSMEs, and boosting manufacturing is setting the stage for a better India.

The new Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs, along with the push for skill development and easier FDI regulations, is a solid approach to promoting growth and making us more competitive globally. Plus, the government’s focus on upskilling the youth and embracing advanced manufacturing and digital tech is giving us a competitive edge.

And the drop in customs duty on PCBs for mobile phones is a game-changer for the electronics industry. Lowering the duty from 20% to 15% will make electronics more competitive and also boost growth for the wearables market.""

Ashok Rajpal, Managing Director, Ambrane India

""In her Budget speech on July 23, 2024, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed reducing the basic customs duty on mobile phones and chargers from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. This move is expected to boost exports and enhance global competitiveness while also increasing domestic adoption by lowering costs. The finance minister emphasized the maturity of the Indian mobile phone industry and highlighted a strong focus on manufacturing, R&D, and innovation, particularly within the MSME sector. These measures are poised to drive substantial growth in the consumer electronics and mobile accessories industries, positioning India as a leading manufacturing hub.""

Bodhisattwa Sanghapriya, Founder and CEO, IG Drones

""We applaud the Union Budget's focus on innovation, R&D, and next-generation reforms, aligning with the Government's nine key priorities. This emphasis will accelerate the growth of the drone sector and enhance advanced technologies like AI and IoT. The budget fosters an environment supporting technological advancements and cutting-edge research, paving the way for significant progress in the drone industry. The FM's announcement of a fivefold expansion of the space economy and a Rs. 1,000 crore boost for the space sector further underscores this commitment.

Additionally, the abolition of the angel tax for all tax classes is excellent news for startups, aiding in capital formation in the country. We are excited about the opportunities this budget presents and remain dedicated to leveraging these advancements to drive innovation and bolster the nation's technological leadership on a global scale. Notably, under the Namo Drone Didi Scheme recently, the Government has allocated Rs. 1,261 crore to provide drones to 15,000 Women Self Help Groups (SHGs) for rental services to farmers, covering 80% of the costs up to Rs 8 lakh.""

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: India to develop a taxonomy for climate finance,"NEW DELHI: India will develop a taxation mechanism for climate finance that will help the country mobilise resources for carrying out climate action in sync with its commitments under the Paris Agreement.“We will develop a taxonomy for climate finance for enhancing the availability of capital for climate adaptation and mitigation. This will support achievement of the country’s climate commitments and green transition,” said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman while presenting the Union Budget for 2024-25.The move is seen as a much-needed step to fund the country’s efforts towards achieving its goal of net-zero by 2070 as preliminary estimates indicate that the aggregate investment support required by India to achieve its 2070 net-zero target will be $1.4 trillion at an average of $28 billion per year.The Economic Survey for the year 2023-24, tabled by Sitharaman in the Parliament on Monday, too flagged the requirement of a huge fund for achieving net-zero goal. It said that raising financial resources for climate change adaptation and mitigation actions of this scale is an unprecedented challenge, especially given that India’s climate action has been largely financed through domestic resources.As per the Reserve Bank of India , bridging this substantial funding gap necessitates allocating 2.5% of India's annual GDP to green finance. A 2022 report by the Climate Policy Initiative found that domestic sources accounted for the majority of green finance in India, at 87% and 83% in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively.“While international sources are increasing (from 13% in FY 2019 to 17% in FY 2020), they are still insufficient to meet India's net-zero target. Mobilising substantial capital from traditional sources presents multifaceted challenges in emerging economies like India,” said the Survey.Expressing his view on the proposal, R R Rashmi, distinguished fellow, TERI and India's former climate negotiator said, ""The budget promises to develop a taxonomy for climate finance so as to enhance availability of green finance. This measure is likely to have an effect only indirectly in the medium term unless it is accompanied by a mandate.""Anjal Prakash, associate professor (research) and research director at the Bharti Institute of Public Policy at ISB believes that the move will support in achieving the country’s climate commitments and also achieve the changes needed on ground.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-india-to-develop-a-taxonomy-for-climate-finance/articleshow/111967224.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: What government can do to prioritise individuals with special needs,"Despite recent increases in GDP and economic growth, the needs of people with disabilities remain less addressed. According to the 2011 census, 2.21% of the total population, or 26.8 million individuals, have disabilities. Since then, amendments to the RPWD Act in 2016 and its implementation in 2017 have increased the number of recognized disabilities from 7 to 21. The number of individuals with disabilities is expected to rise, and according to the WHO, approximately 21% of the world’s population lives with some form of disability.Opportunity and equality are essential not only for inclusivity but also for enhancing economic productivity.The National Trust of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India, has introduced several commendable schemes aimed at mainstreaming individuals with disabilities. These include DISHA (Early Intervention and School Readiness Scheme) for children aged 0-10 years, VIKAAS (Day Care) for supportive care, SAMARTH (Respite Care) for rest homes and treatment, NIRAMAYA (Health Insurance) for OPD coverage, Gyanprabha for covering educational expenses (teaching support), empowerment tools (aids and assistive devices), and initiatives embedded in livelihoods to encourage integration (awareness and community engagement). Additionally, the Samagara Education System ensures and drives inclusive education by providing accessible schools and specially designed spaces for students with special needs, fostering an inclusive learning environment across the country.Despite these government initiatives, much remains to be done. Data from the 2011 Census indicates that approximately 26.8 million individuals have disabilities, corresponding to 2.21% of the total population. Public-private partnerships should be encouraged to reach larger populations and better support individuals with disabilities. Many individuals with special needs are unaware of these programs, making effective advertising and awareness campaigns crucial to ensure the intended beneficiaries reap the benefits.While these schemes are well-designed, scrutiny is needed in terms of implementation and addressing existing loopholes to ensure proper distribution to genuine beneficiaries, elimination of middlemen, and increased accessibility. Budget delivery should prioritize key areas: education and schooling with assistive technology, healthcare including specialized facilities and rehabilitation services, social services such as community integration and family support, employment through job training and incentives for inclusive recruitment, improvement of infrastructure for transportation and public spaces, research and development of new solutions, strengthening legal protections and anti-discrimination policies, and community engagement through awareness campaigns and social inclusion programs. This step is crucial to achieving a more inclusive society and improving the lives of individuals with special needs across India.Developing methods to monitor and measure the impact of investments is necessary. Regular reviews ensure efficient use of funds and contribute to the well-being of individuals with special needs. Governments must work together with relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, advocacy groups, NGOs, and individuals with special needs, to develop inclusive and effective budgetary distribution policies. Periodic reviews and adjustments based on evolving needs and priorities are essential for continuous improvement.As we approach Budget 2024-25, it is important to prioritize individuals with special needs.

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: What is needed to boost the crypto market in India?,"As the Indian government prepares to unveil the upcoming Union Budget , the crypto community is buzzing with hope for reforms that will create a more favourable environment for virtual digital assets (VDAs). The current tax policies and regulatory frameworks governing VDAs in India have been a significant roadblock to their growth and potential. To help this burgeoning market thrive, several key reforms are necessary. These reforms include reducing the TDS rate on VDA transfers, allowing the offset and carryforward of losses, equalizing the treatment of crypto income, establishing a dedicated regulatory body, and developing a supportive regulatory framework for Web3 technologies.Right now, the tax deduction at source (TDS) rate on VDA transfers is set at 1%. This high rate significantly hampers market liquidity and participation, particularly for retail investors and small traders who make up a large portion of the crypto market. A high TDS rate discourages frequent trading, which reduces overall market activity, leading to lower liquidity and higher volatility.In the upcoming Union Budget, it is crucial to address this issue by lowering the TDS rate on VDA transfers from 1% to 0.01%. This substantial reduction would lighten the tax burden on investors, encouraging more active trading and thereby enhancing market liquidity. Additionally, increasing the threshold limit for TDS applicability to Rs 5,00,000 would ensure that small investors are not unduly affected, promoting broader market participation.Currently, the tax regime does not permit the offset and carryforward of losses from VDA trading, which discourages long-term investment in the crypto market. Unlike traditional financial markets, where losses can be offset against gains to reduce the overall tax liability, VDA investors face higher net taxes despite incurring losses.To promote long-term investment and align the crypto market with other financial markets, the Union Budget should include provisions to allow the offset and carryforward of losses from VDA trading. This change would create a more balanced and fair tax framework, enabling investors to manage their portfolios more effectively and encouraging sustained investment in VDAs.Income from virtual digital assets is currently taxed at a flat rate of 30%, which is significantly higher than the tax rates applicable to income from stocks or mutual funds. This disparity complicates tax compliance and undermines the legitimacy of crypto as a mainstream asset class.The Union Budget should aim to simplify compliance and legitimize crypto as a mainstream asset by proposing to tax income from VDAs similarly to income from stocks or mutual funds. Reducing the tax rate from 30% to a level comparable with other industries would create a fairer tax environment and encourage more investors to participate in the crypto market.The absence of a dedicated regulatory body for VDAs has led to regulatory uncertainty, which hinders the growth of the crypto market in India. A specialized regulatory body would ensure transparency, investor protection, and the smooth functioning of the market.The Union Budget should propose the creation of a regulatory body under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) or the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to oversee crypto transactions. This body would be responsible for monitoring market activities, enforcing regulations, and protecting investors’ interests. Providing clear and consistent regulatory oversight would enhance trust and confidence in the crypto market.Web3 technologies, including digital assets and smart contracts, represent the next frontier of technological innovation. However, the lack of clear legal standards for these technologies in India has stifled their development and integration into various industries.To foster innovation and fully realize the potential of blockchain technology, the Union Budget should include provisions for developing a supportive regulatory framework for Web3. This framework should include clear legal standards for digital assets and smart contracts, providing a solid foundation for the integration of blockchain technology into diverse sectors such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. By supporting the growth of Web3 technologies, India can position itself as a global leader in the digital economy.As we eagerly await the upcoming Union Budget, it is crucial for policymakers to recognize the transformative impact of VDAs and implement these reforms to ensure the sustained growth and development of the crypto market. By reducing the TDS rate on VDA transfers, allowing the offset and carryforward of losses, equalizing the treatment of crypto income, establishing a dedicated regulatory body, and developing a supportive regulatory framework for Web3, India can unlock the full potential of virtual digital assets and blockchain technology.Creating a more inclusive and supportive regulatory environment through these much-needed reforms will help India harness the power of digital assets to drive economic growth and innovation. The crypto community eagerly anticipates these changes to propel the market into a new era of prosperity and technological advancement.The author is Co-Founder of NFTFN.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-what-is-needed-to-boost-the-crypto-market-in-india/articleshow/111918889.cms

India today stands out as the fastest growing large economy, amidst an uncertain, divided and an unstable world order. India’s robust and sustained economic growth is one of the key necessities for a nation that is currently at a rather low per capita income of 2,500 dollars per annum, with an ambition to get upwards of 15,000 dollars within the next two decades.Rightfully, we seek to be the 3rd largest economy in the next couple of years, and become a middle-income nation by the decade to follow. For us to achieve these compelling milestones, it is clear that this decade needs to be the ‘decade of transformational actions’, thereby setting a strong foundation of how we shape India@100, across a multitude of disciplines and factors. No doubt, some of the imperatives may be tough and also painful, and may require collective national consensus.With the above purposeful ambition in mind, each year going forward is going to be a momentous and mission-mode step for our country – whether it is the transformation in the social or physical infrastructure, or the rural or agricultural ecosystem, or the digital transformation and new value chains, to create meaningful jobs and engagements for our aspirational young population, both in India as well as overseas.One of the key shifts to realise this ambition is for India to garner much larger share in the global value chains , by substantially raising the share of manufacturing in our GDP from the current 16% to at least 24% of the GDP. Also, we need to do all this in a manner that is holistically sustainable - addressing the challenges posed on all of us, as a result of climate change, resource depletion, gender and other inequities. The government may consider setting up an all-encompassing “Advanced Manufacturing Authority (AMA)” in partnership with industry bodies, such as CII to drive this agenda on mission mode.The AMA should function as an umbrella organisation that is also tasked with the job of skills’ building and upskilling, hand holding MSME’s for enhancing competitiveness, quality, Industry 4.0 & capacity building. It shall also work on building India manufacturing brand and overseas market access opportunities, while exercising ground level coordination with authorities on ease & cost of doing business. The AMA shall make important recommendations to the government for PLI / ELI type incentives for promoting manufacturing in the country. Alongside, the AMA shall also act a bridge between industry and authorities early dispute resolution mechanism.The above suggestion of an AMA is borne out of the fact that manufacturing has remained stagnant around 15% to 17% of our GDP for several decades, despite sincere attempts by many stakeholders and governments in the past. It now warrants a fresh outlook, a new mindset and a different approach to move the needle upwards towards 25%. The opportunity is knocking at our doors and we cannot let it pass this time.The keenly awaited Union budget to be presented on 23rd July this year, is an opportunity for Modi 3.0 government to make a statement and articulate its ambition, together with the strategic direction and key actions and set the ball rolling for the next 5 years. It is important to admit and confirm that the last ten years have indeed been quite transformational, and that have anchored India’s growth despite several global and local challenges, including the covid crisis.In addition to the Manufacturing Conundrum that I have alluded to, let me list out five other areas where FM’s focus should continue, as demonstrated in the previous two terms …Structural reforms: To make India a sought after investment destination. In the past, reforms such as GST, IBC, RERA, EoDB (single window, GEM portal) that have brought about transparency, cut out red tape and inefficiencies. On EoDB, Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanisms need to be adopted more widely.Strong thrust on world class Infrastructure: further raise public capex that will crowd in private investments. It also provides multiplier effect on employment generation.Focus on Climate Action & Sustainability: Attempt to de-carbonize by pushing for Renewable Energy, Cooking gas connections in rural settings, and incentivizing net zero value chains (PLI / ELI schemes)Digitalization and Digital Public Infrastructure: Data focus, Digital governance through actions such JAM trinity, Open source digital public infra (ONDC and UPI) for cashless commerce.Fiscal Discipline in tandem with Growth Mindset : Astute management of Monetary and Fiscal policy, good inflation management and support to the vulnerable. The glide path to reducing the fiscal deficit from 5.6% now to 4.5% by FY2026 shall ensure sustained macro-economic stability, while pursuing 8.0% sustained growth ambitions.While it may not be necessarily be narrated as part of the Union Budget 2024 , we hope to see greater market access for Indian products through FTAs and bilateral relationships, providing a smart balance, which help international companies with reduced tariffs and domestic firms with enhanced global competitiveness – while supporting India’s larger agenda to be self-sufficient, build a dynamic business environment and be globally competitive.In short, as the FM sets out for her second innings, her focus shall be to accelerate reforms to stimulate growth & economic activity, while reaching out to the vulnerable in tandem with maintaining fiscal prudence. She has done this well in the past. However, this is the Budget needs a special look in on Manufacturing as our biggest opportunity as well as the compelling imperative (for job creation).With the ambition of a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (Developed India), the upcoming budget clearly holds the promise of transformative socio-economic growth and development for India.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-kamal-bali-md-volvo-group-india-highlights-auto-industry-expectations-from-union-budget-24/articleshow/111922047.cms
indiatimes.com,How can Budget 2024 make the new income tax regime more attractive for salaried taxpayers? Top points from TOI Online tax experts’ survey,"Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Personal tax experts are of the opinion that some changes in the new income tax regime can be expected.

New Income Tax Regime: What should change?

1.

New Tax Regime: Deduction for housing loan

2.

New Tax Regime: Hike basic exemption limit, standard deduction

3.

New Tax Regime: Benefits for NPS investments

New Tax Regime: What else can be done?

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024 : The Modi government has been looking to make the new income tax regime more attractive for the common man, middle class and salaried income taxpayers. Raising of basic exemption limit , introduction of standard deduction , and tweaking of tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime signal that the government wants taxpayers to shift to the new regime.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024 and personal tax experts are of the opinion that some changes in the new income tax regime can be expected.What can be done to make the new income tax regime more attractive than the old tax regime, especially for individuals who have done their tax planning based on the old regime? TOI Online Survey of personal tax experts finds out:Also Check | Budget 2024 Live Updates All personal tax experts unanimously agree that to make the new income tax more attractive for taxpayers, especially for middle class salaried taxpayers , the government needs to tweak it to introduce more deductions and exemptions.One common deduction that experts believe should make way into the new income tax regime, and one that makes the old tax regime more lucrative for taxpayers, is housing loan deduction.Preeti Sharma, Partner, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India LLP says that currently under the new tax regime, exemption against interest paid on home loan taken for a self-occupied or vacant property is not available. “This provision may be relooked at and be allowed under the new tax regime,” she tells TOI.Agrees Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors, saying, “the deduction for interest on housing loan may be introduced to make it (new tax regime) better for those who still chose the old tax regime.”Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What are the ideal new tax regime slabs, rates for middle class, salaried? TOI Online Survey findings Yet another recommendation is to increase the basic exemption limit and standard deduction under the new regime.“Increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 to 5 lakhs, raise the standard deduction to Rs 100,000,” Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners says that the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime may be further raised by at least Rs 50,000, which will benefit all individual taxpayers (salaried or non-salaried) opting for the new income tax regime. This will help increase purchasing power of the taxpayers which may further boost the investments.Aarti Raote, Partner, Deloitte India says raising the basic exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh and introducing the 30% tax rate to the income category of Rs 20 lakh & above as against the existing limit of Rs 15 lakh will give tax relief to all. She also believes that the standard deduction should be increased to Rs 1 lakh from the existing Rs 50,000 limit.Aarti Raote is of the view that to make the new regime more attractive the government should consider allowing deductions for employee contributions to the NPS within the new tax regime framework.Vialto’s Chander Talreja notes that the employer’s contribution to the NPS is allowed as a deduction under the new income tax regime. “For the non-salaried individuals, while this deduction is not applicable, they do not even get any deduction for their own contribution. This is a hardship and the government may consider introducing deduction in respect of an individual's contribution to NPS under section 80CCD(1B), currently capped at Rs 50,000. This will benefit salaried as well as non-salaried individuals,” he tells TOI.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Raise basic exemption limit, standard deduction and NPS benefits for taxpayers Preeti Sharma believes that in order to promote savings towards retirement, the government may consider allowing deductions available under section 80C of the Act, under the new tax regime as well.Aarti Raote says that in line with the government’s agenda of affordable housing and green energy, it is anticipated that specific deductions towards mortgage repayments on affordable housing or electric vehicles be provided under the new tax regime besides incentivizing taxpayers for installation or adoption of solar energy equipment.However, Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors notes that the government has already rationalized the slabs and the rates in its Budget 2023. “I am not expecting that something more would be done except discontinuing the old tax regime whereby by default everyone is in the new regime,” he tells TOI.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-can-budget-2024-make-the-new-income-tax-regime-more-attractive-for-salaried-taxpayers-top-points-from-toi-online-tax-experts-survey/articleshow/111918794.cms

Other income tax Budget 2024 expectations

Increase in basic exemption limit in Budget 2024: The basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh in the new tax regime is still very low and there is a widespread expectation that the same would be increased to Rs 3.50 lakh.

The basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh in the new tax regime is still very low and there is a widespread expectation that the same would be increased to Rs 3.50 lakh. Widening of tax slab for 20% tax rate: The tax rate of 30% for income exceeding Rs 15 lakh in this regime is very steep and should be made applicable only for income exceeding Rs 30 lakh.

The tax rate of 30% for income exceeding Rs 15 lakh in this regime is very steep and should be made applicable only for income exceeding Rs 30 lakh. Maximum marginal rate to be reduced from 39% to 35.88%: There is a case for eliminating the highest effective tax rate of 39% (due to surcharge and cess) as this is very steep and covers very few taxpayers. The same should be capped at 35.88% [{30% tax rate plus 15% surcharge thereon} plus 4% cess thereon].

There is a case for eliminating the highest effective tax rate of 39% (due to surcharge and cess) as this is very steep and covers very few taxpayers. The same should be capped at 35.88% [{30% tax rate plus 15% surcharge thereon} plus 4% cess thereon]. Increase in Section 80C deduction limit and allowing it in new tax regime

Hike standard deduction limit in Union Budget 2024: It is pertinent to note that several expenses incurred by employees during the course of their jobs are not deductible under current provisions. Additionally, the exemptions available to the salaried u/s 10 are capped at outdated limits that fail to account for inflation, rendering them ineffective. Thus, in order to address this, it is expected that such standard deduction limit be increased to Rs 60,000 and should be adjusted annually in line with the Cost Inflation Index (CII). This would ease the tax burden on salaried individuals and maintain their purchasing power amidst inflationary pressures.

Consider Bengaluru as a ""metro city"" for the purpose of HRA exemption in Budget 2024: ""Currently, tax exemption for HRA is capped at 50% of basic salary if the rented accommodation is in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai or Kolkata; and at 40% of basic salary if the rented accommodation is in any other city. Bengaluru is still not recognised as a metro city despite being the fastest growing city of the country. Adding Bengaluru, NCR, Pune and Hyderabad to the list of metro cities for the purpose of HRA exemption will ease the burden of a large population of salaried taxpayers residing in these cities,"" Poorva Prakash, Partner, Deloitte India, wrote in a column for ET Wealth Online.

At present, taxpayers must choose between the old income tax regime , which includes deductions and exemptions, and the concessional or new income tax regime, which provides lower tax rates but restricts tax-saving opportunities. Even though the concessional tax system offers lower tax rates for the majority of taxpayers, individuals earning more than Rs 15 lakh encounter considerable difficulties.Both tax regimes set the tax rate for income over Rs 15 lakh at 30 per cent. This, combined with the elimination of most exemptions and deductions in the new regime, leads to a greater overall tax responsibility for taxpayers in this category. Consequently, many taxpayers in this income bracket increasingly agree that the existing tax rates do not sufficiently account for the complexities and costs linked to inflation and higher earnings.ET Online polled to gauge the expectations of the Indian population for the approaching budget. The poll garnered feedback from almost 9,500 readers. Here is what taxpayers want from Budget 2024 as per the survery.When considering the rationalization of income tax slabs, the Budget 2024 survey found that over 54 per cent of the participants expressed their desire for the government to transition Indians to the new income tax regime while also proposing exemptions for income up to Rs 15 lakh.Following the BJP's weakened mandate, the survey revealed that 56% of Indians believe Finance Minister Sitharaman should prioritize reducing income tax in the upcoming Union Budget 2024. Additionally, 37% of respondents indicated that the government should focus on addressing the rising job crisis.More than 20 per cent of respondents want the government to increase exemptions under Section 80C and other sections of the old tax regime in Budget 2024. Additionally, over 14 per cent of respondents are calling for the extension of Section 80C benefits to the new tax regime. Furthermore, more than 11 per cent of the respondents hope the government will increase tax rates for higher-income slabs and reduce rates for lower-income slabs.In a recent column Suresh Surana, Practising Chartered Accountant wrote for ET Wealth Online, here is what the FM can do to ease the tax burden of the common man.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-move-all-exemptions-deductions-to-new-tax-regime-say-salaried-taxpayers/articleshow/111918500.cms

Currently Scaling my Dream Venture. Love Straightforward People & Candid Conversations. Humanitarian by Practice. Passionate about Start-up Storytelling & Sport Development. Tweets irregularly from @amandhall25 LESS ... MORE

In India, job creation has been a vital topic of discussion, especially as the economy has significantly transformed over the past three decades due to globalisation. To tackle unemployment, India has been leveraging the potential of entrepreneurship.

To generate employment opportunities, the government has introduced various schemes to promote entrepreneurship and provide wage employment. One such initiative is the Skill India scheme, launched in 2015, with the goal of training over 400 million people.

Another key initiative is the Startup India program, designed to foster startup ventures and encourage youth entrepreneurship by creating a favourable business environment.

Recognizing that young people are often at the forefront of innovation and creativity, startups are harnessing India’s vast talent pool. Startups have proven highly effective in generating employment opportunities for the currently unemployed, often surpassing the efforts of large corporations. In fact, startups in India have generated over 1.5 million jobs, according to a report by Nasscom, showcasing their significant impact on the job market.

By reducing unemployment rates, startups have made a substantial impact on society, addressing poverty and stimulating domestic production and national income through increased consumer spending within the Indian economy.

With the Indian startup ecosystem now ranked as the third-largest globally, here’re my expectations from the upcoming Union Budget for 2024-25:

Ease Regulations for Startups to Fulfil India’s Ambition of Viksit Bharat

Startups are pivotal in driving innovation, economic growth, and job creation. For this momentum to continue, the government must streamline regulatory procedures, provide tax benefits, and enhance funding availability for early-stage startups. There should be increased regulatory flexibility to attract more entrepreneurs and investors.

This will facilitate the establishment of more offices in India, fostering job creation and economic growth. Additionally, enabling domestic capital participation through large PSU investments in VC firms and providing capital gains tax exemptions on startup investments can further boost investment activity, potentially restoring pre-pandemic investment levels.

Increase Spending on AI R&D by 50%

Startups continually encourage their workforce to upskill, adapt to changing environments, and stay at the forefront of their fields. In the Union Budget 2022-23, the Indian government allocated Rs 200 crore for AI and related technologies under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

With the rapid advancement of generative AI, there should be at least a 50% increase over the current allocation to accelerate innovation for AI research and development, and supporting skill enhancement initiatives, while maintaining ethical standards.

Ease Taxation & Compliance Burden for MSMEs to Flourish

According to a 2023 report by CII, over 40% of MSMEs find GST compliance cumbersome, leading to increased costs and inefficiencies. Additionally, a 2022 study by the National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) highlights that about 30% of MSMEs struggle with tax-related issues due to unclear regulations and frequent procedural changes.

The government should streamline processes such as taxation and offer additional incentives to boost Indian startups. Simplifying the GST structure and enhancing the ease of taxation for MSMEs are critical. Currently, MSMEs face significant challenges with the complex GST regime, which includes a high compliance burden and frequent changes in tax rates.

Inject Funding in Rural Startups & Support Business Training

According to a 2023 report by the Rural Development Ministry, nearly 60% of rural startups face difficulties accessing funding, with only 15% receiving financial support from formal channels. Enhancing infrastructure development in both rural and urban areas is crucial to creating more job prospects and fostering a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem in underserved regions.

The budget should focus on boosting the growth of small businesses in rural areas to expand employment opportunities beyond agriculture. This includes offering business training to rural youth, streamlining the process of starting a business, and implementing a swift loan distribution system for micro-enterprises in villages.

This budget is expected to build on the foundations of previous fiscal plans, focusing on sustainability, infrastructure, healthcare , and renewable energy. Here’s what various sectors are hoping for from the upcoming budget:The Union Budgets of recent years have laid the groundwork for robust economic growth. Noteworthy initiatives include the Urban Infrastructure Development Fund (UIDF) with a ₹10,000 crore allocation, aimed at enhancing urban facilities in smaller cities. The substantial increase in capital expenditure to ₹13.7 lakh crore, representing 4.5% of GDP, underscores the government’s commitment to sustainable urban growth.In healthcare, significant investments have been made in the National Health Mission and Ayushman Bharat schemes to improve access and affordability. Furthermore, digital infrastructure projects like BharatNet aim to connect 2.5 lakh gram panchayats with optical fibre, promoting a strong digital economy.Vaibhav Kaushik, Co-founder & CEO of Nawgati, highlights the transformative potential of India’s hydrogen mission under the National Green Hydrogen Mission. He points to significant strides such as NTPC’s green hydrogen blending with CNG and GAIL’s integration of hydrogen into CNG networks. However, challenges like high production costs, lack of skilled manpower, and infrastructure investment need to be addressed. Vaibhav hopes the budget will allocate targeted funds and introduce streamlined regulatory frameworks to accelerate green hydrogen adoption, helping India reduce carbon emissions and become a global leader in hydrogen technology, creating numerous jobs and enhancing energy security.Sanjeev Bhandari, Founder & CEO of AirBrick Infra , expresses optimism about the budget’s continued focus on infrastructure development and urbanization. He anticipates the continuation of the Urban Infrastructure Development Fund (UIDF) to significantly benefit Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, enhancing urban infrastructure and driving housing demand. The increased capital expenditure reflects the government’s dedication to developing sustainable urban environments, positively impacting the real estate sector. Sanjeev also emphasises the role of AI in transforming interior design, streamlining design processes, optimising space utilisation, and enhancing predictive maintenance for interiors. He expects the budget to support AI innovation, particularly in smart building projects, driving efficiency and sustainability in urban development.Dr. Dharmesh Shah, Founder & Director of Holistica World, highlights the critical concern of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in India. He suggests the budget should prioritise NCDs, which significantly impact individual and family expenses. While commending the government's efforts to combat diabetes and hypertension, Dr. Dharmesh advocates for more emphasis on early intervention and natural therapies. He hopes the budget will focus on measures to identify NCDs early and implement natural therapies to address their root causes, reducing the overall disease burden and ensuring societal well-being.Surjeet Thakur, Founder & CEO of TrioTree Technologies, calls for a robust policy framework to foster innovation, ensure quality healthcare, and support the health tech industry’s growth to achieve its projected $50 billion mark by 2025. Key focus areas include reducing import duties on medical devices, streamlining GST policies, and enhancing funding for research and development. Surjeet advocates for increased investment in healthcare infrastructure, particularly medical device parks, to boost local manufacturing and reduce import dependency. He also emphasises the need for regulatory frameworks for HealthTech startups, R&D incentives, cybersecurity investments, and integration with government healthcare schemes like Ayushman Bharat to enhance efficiency and reach.The Union Budget 2024 is poised to be a pivotal moment in India’s journey towards economic resilience and growth. By addressing the critical needs of sectors such as renewable energy, infrastructure, health, and health tech, the budget can lay down a path for sustainable and inclusive development. Expert insights underscore the importance of strategic investments, regulatory support, and innovative approaches to achieve the nation's ambitious goals. With these focused efforts, India is well-positioned to advance towards a future of economic stability and environmental sustainability, moving closer to its vision of a robust $5 trillion economy.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-the-approach-needed-around-infrastructure-health-and-renewable-energy/articleshow/111918086.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Salesforce India CEO expecting recognition of IT sector’s role in creating well paying jobs,"“The technology industry has gone through a transformation in the last year. As a leader in the technology industry, I’m expecting the budget to recognise the role of the IT sector in creating well paying jobs while increasing efficiency and productivity. The depth of IT talent in India is well recognized but we need to deepen the play with proper skipping initiatives and increasing ease of doing business while exploring ways in which IT can be used for further job creation such as improving citizen services, addressing the needs of our large population, and helping in improving standards of living.

AI is omnipresent today, and collectively we are about to unleash Artificial Intelligence delivering a huge amount of positive impact for all industries and we need to align with the potential impact on lives. Building the right skills within the working-age population will be crucial to sustain the growth momentum and equitable wealth distribution. While there are several resources available for upskilling, standardising these through certifications and publicising them extensively, especially in tier 3, tier 4, and rural areas is critical.

Secondly, encouraging technology adoption in local industries, which is currently lacking, can help drive global competitiveness and greatly improve productivity. Over the years, the Government itself has demonstrated the immense power of technology adoption through the success of platforms such as CoWIN, UIDAI, UPI, Digiyatra etc. The government must showcase its successes to encourage the proliferation of cutting-edge technology in local industry. Of course, there is immense scope for the Government to scale up technology adoption to deliver superior citizen services, speed up infrastructure development, and plug subsidy leakages.

In the coming years, driving sustained growth and generating employment are key priorities for the country, and technology can be the biggest enabler to achieve these goals. India has proven itself as a global hub for technology talent and emerged as a preferred destination for global capacity centres (GCCs). Taking steps to smoothen the path and also ensure ease of doing business will drive innovation from India. Simplifying onerous compliance requirements can go a long way in accelerating the growth of India. GCCs for instance generate employment and set off a multiplier effect, driving consumption and secondary employment in their ecosystem.”

indiatimes.com,"Union Budget 2024: Massive shift in capital expenditure likely, says expert","

The Union Budget will likely focus on expanding capital investment in several sectors, including infrastructure, construction, manufacturing and green energy, a professor of a top business school said. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget in Parliament on Tuesday.Over a period of time, the central government has increased capital expenditure by around 30 per cent every year, and this year, a massive shift is expected in this regard, said Dr Trilochan Tripathy, Professor of Finance at XLRI.""India will definitely grow at faster rate because the whole attention of the government is to promote capital expenditure... The overall capital expenditure is expected to grow about 50 per cent for the 2024-25 fiscal,"" he told PTI.In the upcoming Union Budget, the finance minister is expected to set an optimistic growth target of over 7.5 per cent against the recent forecasts of 7 per cent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), he said.To achieve this growth target, Tripathy said there is a need for a broad-based allocation of resources across sectors.He expressed hope that the Budget will focus on ""expanding capital investment in areas like infrastructure, construction, manufacturing, green sustainable energy, clean energy technologies and defence and aerospace as these sectors are the prospective growth drivers for the economy"".Besides, Sitharaman is likely to formulate policies for private sector participation.India is also well poised for development in the defence sector, with the government focusing on increased investment in sectors like ports, railways and aviation, said Tripathy, who is also an Assistant Dean at XLRI.The Centre could offer incentives or tax breaks to private players for investment in defence production and supplies, as well as implement special schemes to attract MSMEs and startups for supporting the sector, he said.""To strengthen the defence production ecosystem, the government may collaborate with other countries or foreign companies for technology and knowledge transfer,"" Tripathy said.According to him, the government's investment focus will also be on green hydrogen policy, green energy production and transmission, public digital platform development, high-tech manufacturing sectors like semiconductors and medical devices and artificial intelligence.""Investments in these areas will foster economic growth, drive innovation and social development along with achieving India's net zero emission target by 2070,"" he said.A comprehensive agricultural policy to make India self-reliant in foodgrain production might also be on the cards, the professor added.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/union-budget-2024-massive-shift-in-capital-expenditure-likely-says-expert/articleshow/111924965.cms

As the countdown to the Union Budget 2024 has begun, the Indian stock market participants would be keenly watching if the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman listens to the industry's long standing demand of removing the long term capital gains ( LTCG ) and the Securities Transaction Tax STT ) this time around.The demand is to levy a uniform 10% tax (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on equities held for more than one year and up to three years on the capital gains exceeding Rs 2 lakh in a financial year. Moreover, a full exemption from capital gains tax if held for more than three years, by suitable amendments to section 112A.LTCG tax is charged on selling shares held for over 12 months if the income exceeds the Rs 1 lakh threshold. Meanwhile, STCG or Short Term Capital Gains tax arises from the transfer of listed equity shares or units of an equity-oriented fund held up to 12 months at a concessional rate of 15%.In a proposal sent to the Ministry of Finance, industry body Association of Mutual Funds in India ( Amfi ) has told the government that the exemption from LTCG tax after a 3 years holding period will encourage long term investments in equities and will help channelise more household savings into the equity markets, thus helping the Indian economy. It has also urged to increase the limit of Rs 1 lakh, saying that the existing threshold in a financial year is ""very low"".Echoing a similar sentiment, a note by Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates, said that investors will want LTCG to be removed as this could give a boost to new investors who have started their investment journey in the last 12–36 months. ""As requested also by ANMI, the government should provide tax exemptions of up to 1 lakh in STCG,"" the note said.Another pain point is the STT, which a section of the industry is hopeful of getting government attention. The government levies a 0.1% STT on each equity sale or purchase transactions on exchanges.ICRA Analytics said that the demand for STT removal has been there for many years now and its removal will attract more investors to the domestic equity markets.In 2004, security transaction tax (STT) replaced the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax but the budget of 2018 brought back LTCG levy again at a rate of 10%. on annual gains of over Rs 1 lakh but STT was not removed, Asit C. Mehta Investment note said.Meanwhile, a section in the market is less hopeful of government largesse.Krishna Rao, Managing Director & Co-Head - Equity Broking, JM Financial Services, said that the interim Union budget kept the STT charges unchanged and there are no expectations of any major overhauls in the STT rates even this time around.Rao sees the government taking measures to curb F&O transactions in order to restrict speculative activities in the capital markets.""It is widely anticipated that in the upcoming Union budget, government may increase STT in the derivatives segment especially for high frequency traders (HFT) or treat income from F&O as lottery (versus currently it is treated as business income and taxed as per income tax slabs) which would attract flat 31.2% tax on gain,"" he added.In his view, the government may even introduce TDS on F&O transactions.The average daily turnover in equity futures/options on NSE has seen significant increase of 1.5x/18x over FY19-FY24 and a government action might have an impact on F&O turnover on the exchanges, he opined.Also Read: Budget 2024: LTCG, STT removal in the industry wishlist for FM Sitharaman (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi came back for a third term in office, the first file he signed was for the release of the 17th instalment of the PM Kisan Nidhi scheme . Additionally, in its maiden cabinet session, the NDA government greenlit new Minimum Support Price (MSP) for 14 kharif crops in 2024-25 marketing season, recommending the highest absolute increase over the previous year for oilseeds and pulses in a signal to farmers to opt for these crops with an eye on trimming the country’s import bill.These moves around the farming sector and their timing underscore the pivotal role this sector plays in the Modi government's agenda of making India the third-largest economic power in the world.Experts say that the upcoming budget that is set to be tabled by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the second half of July will have some populist measures for farmers as last month’s Lok Sabha election results didn’t happen the way BJP wanted them to, mainly because of the party's performance in rural and semi-urban India and the Hindi heartland.The agriculture sector is likely to grow at 3.7 per cent in the current fiscal, compared to 1.4 per cent last year, according to CII.As Budget 2024 looms closer, the agricultural sector is likely to get the spotlight as it is the life support for about 250 million farmers and informal labourers.The BJP's vote share dipped in semi-urban and rural areas, with 36.6% and 35%, respectively. This marked a significant shift from 2019 for the BJP, which then had a 39.5% vote share in rural areas, 36.8% in semi-urban sectors, and 33.6% in urban areas.Having suffered at the recent elections, mostly in rural areas, the new NDA government would most certainly find newer ways to support farmers in the upcoming budget, also because some key agricultural states like Maharashtra and Haryana are up for state elections soon, as per Shweta Saini, an agricultural economist and co-founder of Arcus Policy Research who also feels that “Indian policymaking is very tricky- particularly in agriculture.”“There is a strong possibility for the announcement of incentive and welfare schemes for development in rural and semi-urban areas,” reiterated Tulsi Lingareddy, senior economist, Financial Markets, Sustainable Finance and Agriculture.During the interim budget, a significant hike in the instalment of the Centre’s flagship cash transfer scheme PM KISAN scheme was expected. But defying those expectations, Sitharaman kept the outlay unchanged.However, experts now feel that there is a strong case for strengthening the scheme in the Union budget 2024 The current disbursement under PM Kisan accounts for approximately 3-5 per cent of a farm family income. The disbursement started in 2019, and given the cost inflation over the last 5 years, along with the backdrop of export curbs on few commodities, there could be an enhancement in the quantum disbursed per farm family, says Pushan Sharma, Director of Research at CRISIL.The extra disbursement could be given to farmers as a subsidy to cover the costs of different inputs needed for farming, he says. This could increase their spending on better agricultural products like advanced pesticides, hybrid seeds, and crop nutrients, leading to higher yields, adds Sharma. “Moreover, with climate change and unpredictable monsoon patterns affecting farmers, this additional income support can help them use more resilient farming methods.”Experts say the need of intervention is ardently required on the agri infrastructure front as farmers often face the woes of post-harvest losses.“As of FY23, CIPHET reported post-harvest losses of Rs. 92,650 crores annually and thus, if the budget allocation is increased under the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) scheme, it may boost the storage and warehousing capabilities in the country which would help farmers in reducing post-harvest losses thereby improving their realisations,” says Sharma.When asked about the expectations of farmers for the upcoming budget, Dr Lingareddy said “Focus may be on connecting farmers/FPOs (Farmers Producer Organisations) to markets through promoting digital infrastructure and e-commerce in addition to promoting physical market infrastructure and warehousing.”The government has prohibited exports of wheat and non-basmati white rice and has also imposed curbs on sugar exports.“Having suffered on account of banned exports and lower crop due to El Nino, some support may be extended for sugarcane farmers,” says Saini.India's agriculture exports, at present over $50 billion, are expected to double by 2030 and reach $100 billion, as per the government.Crop diversification, promotion of exports and import substitution in oilseeds/pulses are areas where enhanced policy interventions are needed, according Anand Ramanathan, Partner and Consumer Products and Retail sector Leader, Deloitte India.Industry experts feel that the Agriculture Accelerator Fund and Digital public infrastructure fund are likely to be focused on strengthening the agribusiness ecosystem in the country.Startups focused on infield technology like drone applications, precision farming, satellite imagery and IoT, which would help farmers in transitioning to modern agriculture from conventional practices, need to be prioritised, Sharma says.In the interim budget, FM Sitharaman had announced that the govt will formulate a strategy to make the country self-reliant in edible oils by boosting domestic output of oilseeds, come out with a comprehensive programme to support dairy farmers, and set up five integrated aqua parks and launch a new climate resilient scheme for the blue economy 2.0 for fisheries development.Making India self-reliant in oilseeds such as mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean and sunflower is expected to remain a focus area of the budget as India currently has to import a large quantity of edible oils to meet its domestic demand. During the 2022-23 marketing year (Nov-Oct), India imported nearly 165 lakh tonnes of cooking oils worth almost Rs 1.4 lakh crore.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/union-budget-2024-pm-kisan-nidhi-scheme-expectations-agriculture-infrastructure-farmers/articleshow/111915734.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024 for retail: Will Union Budget 2024 address the retail industry’s ask for streamlined tax compliance?,"Budget 2024 expectations: India's retail sector is a vital cog in the nation's economic engine. (AI image)

By Sanket Desai

(The author is Indirect Tax Partner - Consumer Products and Retail, EY India)

Budget 2024 retail sector expectations: Indian consumer spending, an indicator of the country’s economic growth, has been gradually increasing over the years. Private consumption has accounted for more than half of nominal GDP since 1996. E-commerce and modern trade have been the drivers of the consumer and retail sector, especially in urban markets, including tier 2 cities.To promote consumption, the government can put more money in the hands of consumers through income tax benefits. On the corporate side, lower import duties, attractive investment scenarios, tax rationalization and simplified compliance can further unleash the retail sector’s potential.At present, retail accounts for around 10% of the country’s GDP and 8% of employment. It is, therefore, important for the government to address the sector’s pain points and concerns. The sector has high growth potential owing to India’s growing middle class, increasing purchasing power, and unexplored tier 2, tier 3 and rural markets in various categories such as apparel, cosmetics, footwear, watches, food and beverages and jewellery.Also Check | Budget 2024 Live Updates One of measures the industry is eagerly awaiting is 100% FDI for Multi-Brand Retail Trading in products manufactured in India, up from the current 51% allowed under approval route. This limit was set in 2012. The higher investment will enable traditional as well as modern trade retail to avail benefits of best-in-class global technology and infrastructure, improved supply chains, and greater efficiency, which works to the advantage of small retailers as well as consumers.The industry is looking forward to rationalisation of custom duty rates by reducing duties for various inputs that are used for manufacture of consumer products and increasing duties on direct import of finished products. This would incentivise Make in India and provide a level playing field to domestic manufacturers. There is also a need to streamline custom duty rates for specific consumer products. For instance, contact lenses are liable to 10% basic customs duty whereas the lens care solution (disinfectant used for wearing contact lenses) is subject to 20% basic customs duty. Hence, the basic customs duty rate for lens care solutions should also be reduced to 10%. Similarly, the basic customs duty rate on intraocular lenses could also be reduced to zero.The sector is also looking forward to changes in GST rules, which will help them streamline operations. While GST rate amendments are announced through GST Council meetings, the Finance Minister has an important role in the Council. The industry therefore is expecting suitable amendments and clarifications in the Union Budget to address the issue of GST rate rationalization for various consumer products and reduce potential future classification disputes.While there have been multiple efforts to rationalize GST rates, there is more to do for a host of consumer products. For example, fruit-based carbonated drinks are subject to a high rate of 40%. regulatory authorities are investigating extruded snacks made out of flour, oil and flavours to tax them at 18% versus the 12% that companies are following.Further, in order to conclude the legal customs litigations and disputes, an amnesty scheme along the lines of ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ or other similar schemes would be a welcome decision.Also Read | Railway Budget 2024: Indian Railways to journey beyond Vande Bharat? Experts suggest focus on non-AC trains, safety Another typical GST issue the retail industry faces is input tax credit reversal requirement on damaged, defective and expired goods. Suitable clarifications should be issued to lay down the computation methodology. Clarification is also needed for cases where the distributor returns expired goods to the brand owner, and the brand owner issues a financial credit note but does not claim GST deduction on the credit notes. In such cases, there should be no need to reverse input tax credit on destruction of goods since GST was already paid at the time of original sale and no input tax credit was taken on sales return of goods.Retail companies also face a disadvantage if they build stores. Just as a plant and machinery are the most important capital investment for a manufacturing company, for a retail company, the most significant asset is its stores. However, under the GST law, input tax credit on goods or services used for construction of any immovable property is not allowed. The industry seeks amendment in Section 17(5) of the CGST Act, to allow input tax credit for goods or services used in construction of stores.Many retail companies operate through multiple stores across states, closing and opening stores on a regular basis. In case a store closure results in surrender of GST registration in the respective state, the GST credit balance on the date of closure is required to be reversed, thereby resulting in an additional GST cost for companies. Hence, for such cases, an appropriate provision should be inserted in the GST law for refund of GST credit balance as on the date the GST registration is surrendered.Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What are the ideal new tax regime slabs, rates for middle class, salaried? TOI Online Survey findings Further, to give more fungibility to GST credit, taxpayers should be allowed to transfer the credit balance of IGST, CGST, and compensation cess from one registration to another (i.e., between registrations with the same PAN).Also, as a measure towards ease of doing business and reducing the compliance burden on retail companies, requirement of E-way bill generation should be dispensed with in cases where Invoice Reference Number (IRN) and QR code is generated.Different interpretations of GST laws has led to the number of GST-related litigations increasing and there is an urgent requirement to constitute the GST Appellate Tribunal at the earliest. The government must also take a relook at the limited duration allowed for appeals. If an appeal against a GST order is not filed within 90 days, the GST authorities can condone delay only up to 1 month. After 1 month, the appeal gets time barred. There is a need to amend the statutory provisions to give powers to the GST authorities to condone delay even beyond 1 month in cases where sufficient cause for delay is proved.India's retail sector is a vital cog in the nation's economic engine. With consumer spending on the rise, the sector is looking towards the Union Budget for measures such as FDI liberalization and tax simplification which support retail expansion. Amendments and clarifications can lead to the right policy mix which can boost the country’s retail landscape.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-for-retail-will-union-budget-2024-address-the-retail-industrys-ask-for-streamlined-tax-compliance/articleshow/111931290.cms

As the Union Budget 2024-25 is set to be presented on 23rd July by FM Nirmala Sitharaman, all eyes are on the major gaps in higher education that need to be addressed. These include inadequate funding for scholarships and financial aid, which hinders access for economically disadvantaged students. Infrastructure deficiencies, such as outdated facilities and insufficient amenities, as well as campus modernisation also require substantial investments.Additionally, there is a pressing need for enhanced research and innovation support through grants and incentives for collaborative projects. Skill development programmes need to be expanded too while vocational training courses are required to be improved in order to align education with industry demands. Lastly, significant investments in digital infrastructure and connectivity are essential to facilitate online learning and bridge the digital divide in remote areas.Here is a detailed overview of the major areas in higher education that need to focussed attention in Sitharaman’s Union Budget 2024-25.Accessibility remains a major challenge in Indian higher education. Scholarships and financial aid programmes can play a significant role in ensuring that talented students from economically weaker sections can pursue higher education. The Union Budget 2024 needs to increase allocations for merit-based and need-based scholarships, and offer more grants, making higher education inclusive and equitable.In higher education funding, a noticeable imbalance exists. Historically, central institutions receive a substantial portion of the budget, whereas state universities and colleges struggle with inadequate resources. This shortfall hampers their ability to attract top-notch faculty, maintain crucial infrastructure, and build the advanced labs and libraries necessary for a contemporary education system. The Union budget 2024 is the best opportunity to reconsider this funding approach. A viable solution could be for the central government to design grant programmes specifically targeted towards state universities and colleges. These grants could be dedicated to supporting high-quality scientific research in emerging fields that align with the vision of a Viksit BharatThe state of infrastructure in Indian universities remains a significant concern for students and educators alike. Many institutions struggle with outdated facilities, inadequate classrooms, and insufficient amenities. Hence, expectations from FM’s Budget 2024 include allocation of substantial funds towards infrastructure development, including the construction of new campuses, renovation of existing facilities, and the provision of modern amenities such as laboratories, libraries, and sports complexes. Improved infrastructure is not only crucial for enhancing the learning environment but also for attracting talented faculty and students.Research and innovation are integral to advancing knowledge, driving economic growth, and solving societal challenges. So, it is expected that the Union Budget 2024 will prioritize funding for research initiatives within universities, including grants for research projects, establishment of research centres and incentives for collaborative research with industry and international partners. In order to boost funding for research and development in higher education, the government can amp up grants and subsidies for university-driven research. This will drive innovation and ensure that India continues to lead globally as thought and innovation leader.In today's competitive job market, employers increasingly value practical skills and industry-specific knowledge. Therefore, there is a growing expectation for Budget 2024 to allocate resources towards expanding skill development programmes within higher education institutions. Introduction of vocational training courses, industry-academia partnerships, and certifications that align with emerging job trends are some of the initiatives that will be appreciated.Additionally, promoting investments in skill certification and leadership development programs through tax incentives can greatly enhance both individual and organizational preparedness for future challenges. Budgetary measures that support a skilled and adaptable workforce, will help establish India as a centre for innovation and sustainable growth.Offering tax incentives for EdTech startups and investing in digital tool training for educators would significantly advance the goal of widening the accessibility of quality education. To enhance student employability, incorporating industry-relevant skills and vocational training into educational curricula is highly recommended. It will foster public-private partnerships to address the skills gap, and provide incentives for internships and apprenticeships.The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of digital learning and technology-enabled education. It is expected that Budget 2024 will prioritize funding for enhancing digital infrastructure, expanding broadband connectivity, and promoting the integration of technology in teaching and learning processes. Access to digital resources, online courses, and virtual laboratories is seen as essential for bridging educational gaps, especially in remote and underserved areas. Furthermore, investments in digital education can facilitate personalized learning experiences and prepare students for the digital economy.In the Union Budget 2024, key policy initiatives should focus on making international education more accessible to Indian students. This can be achieved by increasing scholarships and financial aid for studying abroad, establishing bilateral agreements with foreign universities for exchange programmes, and reducing bureaucratic hurdles for obtaining visas and foreign study permits. Additionally, incentivizing partnerships between Indian and international institutions can create joint degree programmes and research collaborations. By implementing these measures, the government can empower Indian students with global educational opportunities, fostering a more globally competent and competitive workforce.Ensuring equitable access to higher education remains a pressing concern. Aspirants expect Budget 2024 to introduce inclusive policies and support mechanisms for students from marginalized communities, including Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), and persons with disabilities (PwDs). This includes increasing the allocation of funds for reserved seats, enhancing infrastructure in minority institutions, and providing financial assistance to economically backward students from these communities.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-8-policy-measures-to-expect-for-higher-education-from-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-this-year/articleshow/111932268.cms

Ahead of the union budget 2024 , finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey in parliament today. According to the Economic Survey 2023-24, India is among the fastest-growing 5G networks in the world. After the launch of 5G services in October 2022, the country’s ranking on mobile broadband speeds has improved from 118 to 15 in March 2024.The Survey added that India’s overall teledensity (measured as number of telephones per 100 population) has increased from 75.2 % in March 2014 to 85.7 % in March 2024.According to it, the number of wireless telephone connections stood at 116.5 crore at the end of March 2024.“The Bharat 5G Portal propels India's 5G capabilities and fosters innovation, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing within the telecom sector ,"" the Survey said.Telecom technology development requires significantly large and patient capital for R&D and commercialisation. According to the survey, the government has decided to allocate 5% of annual collections from the Universal Services Obligation Fund (USOF) to address the same.It has also created a Telecom Technology Development Fund in 2022 that has seen significant participation from start-ups, MSMEs, academia and industry.As per the Economic Survey 2023-24, the total number of mobile towers in the country was 8.02 lakh as of June 2024. While the number of Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) stood at 29.37 lakh while 5G BTSs were 4.5 lakh.According to it, the internet subscribers in the country jumped from 25.1 crore in March 2014 to 95.4 crore in March 2024, of whom 91.4 crore are accessing the internet via wireless phones.“The internet density also increased to 68.2 per cent in March 2024 while the cost of data has declined substantially, vastly improving the average wireless data usage per subscriber,” it said.The Survey further added that the amended BharatNet national broadband program is now being rolled out to provide broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats in the country. “As of 31 March, 2024, 6,83,175 kilometers of Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) has been laid, connecting a total of 2,06,709 Gram Panchayats (GPs) by OFC in the BharatNet phase I & II,” it said.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-india-is-among-fastest-growing-5g-networks-says-economic-survey/articleshow/111924791.cms
indiatimes.com,Union Budget 2024: What mutual fund investors expect from FM Nirmala Sitharaman's Budget,"Mutual fund investors are looking at how they should proceed ahead of the budget, and what they can expect from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's budget for the financial year 2024-25. ETMutualFunds reached out to financial advisors about what mutual fund investors can expect from the Finance Minister and what changes they should make in their investment strategy.Experts were of the opinion that investors should avoid trying to time the market based on budget expectations and should focus on maintaining a long-term investment strategy.“Ahead of the Union Budget , mutual fund investors should avoid trying to time the market based on budget expectations, as this can be risky and may lead to missed opportunities. Instead, focus on maintaining a long-term investment strategy and stay invested through market cycles. By adhering to a well-thought-out plan and avoiding knee-jerk reactions to budget news, investors can better achieve their financial goals. The budget should not be the reason to take action; instead, you should regularly revisit your asset allocation and market cap allocation every six months or annually. If you see any significant deviations from your targets, you should rebalance your portfolio accordingly. This disciplined approach ensures that your investments remain aligned with your financial objectives and risk tolerance, regardless of short-term market events,” said Sagar Shinde, VP Research, Fisdom.Another expert recommends that investors should not do anything different ahead of budget.“A budget is a routine exercise every year and we do not believe investors need to do anything different for it. They should continue to invest based on their goals, risk appetite and time horizon and ignore all the noise. While the Gross SIPs are at a record high of more than Rs 21,000 crore, the concern is that the net SIPs are only just above Rs 8,000 crore a month. That means, many investors have stopped their SIPs considering the markets to be at an all-time high. SIPs and STPs should always continue and investors should not try to time the markets,” Rajesh Minocha, a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), Founder of Financial Radiance.“Investors should focus on the fundamentals of their investments. High-quality funds with strong track records and consistent performance should remain core holdings regardless of budget outcomes. If there are funds that have significantly deviated from their target allocations, consider adjusting them. While it’s tempting to make quick changes based on budget speculations, investors should avoid hasty decisions. Long-term investment strategies should not be drastically altered based on short-term market movements or budget expectations. It is recommended to diversify investments across different sectors and asset classes to mitigate risks,” recommends Adhil Shetty, CEO of Bankbazaar.com. AMFI recently came out with its 16-point proposal for the Union Budget which included request for tax concessions in debt mutual funds, request to amend the definition of equity-oriented funds to include fund of funds investing in equity-oriented funds, taxability of long-term capital gains under section 112A of the Act, all mutual funds should be allowed to launch pension-oriented MF schemes (MFLRS) with Uniform Tax Treatment as NPS, and few other points.Mutual fund investors have different expectations from the budget. Experts share their opinions on what investors can expect from the Union Budget 2024.A financial advisor said that the new tax regime is likely to become more popular and the government is likely to provide more incentives for people wanting to shift from the old tax regime while another believes that the initiatives aimed at enhancing infrastructure, promoting digital payments, and simplifying taxation, along with other measures are likely to boost market sentiment, enabling investors to make financial decisions with greater confidence and reduced concern.“As always, this year also there are high expectations from the budget. Investors are looking forward to reducing income tax rates and increasing zero income tax limits, considering the purchasing power of money has been reduced due to inflation. The new tax regime is likely to become more popular and the government is likely to provide more incentives for people wanting to shift from the old tax regime. There is a demand to remove capital gains tax if equity mutual funds are held for more than three years. There are also demands for similar capital gains taxes across various categories,” said Minocha.He also added that, “There were similar demands earlier as well, and that's when the indexation benefit on debt mutual funds was removed and it was a major negative for the industry. But soon the industry and the investors were able to adapt. Investors need to believe in India's story and even if there are no sops provided, as long as there is no major bad news, I think it will be a very positive step for India and its march towards being a $5 trillion economy.”“Investors generally anticipate initiatives aimed at enhancing infrastructure, promoting digital payments, and simplifying taxation, along with other measures to spur overall economic growth. Such announcements are likely to boost market sentiment, enabling investors to make financial decisions with greater confidence and reduced concern,” said Shetty.An expert believes that this budget is not expected to deliver any negative surprises, maintaining a stable and supportive environment for economic growth and investment.“Investors can expect the Union Budget 2024 to focus on increased capital expenditure in infrastructure, modernisation of PSUs, and support for the agriculture sector. Tax reforms, particularly adjustments to personal income tax slabs and benefits for startups and MSMEs, are also anticipated. Additionally, there will likely be continued investments in renewable energy and other green initiatives. Emphasis on healthcare expansion and social security measures for senior citizens is expected. Importantly, the budget is not expected to deliver any negative surprises, maintaining a stable and supportive environment for economic growth and investment,” comments Shinde.Sectoral and thematic funds , such as PSU, manufacturing, infra, defence, which have been investors' favourite for some time now, have been among the top performers in the equity mutual fund category across different horizons. Several initiatives by the ruling government in these sectors have helped these funds to deliver stellar performance.These funds have continued to receive the highest inflows from April 2024 to June 2024 (last available data), according to the monthly data released by AMFI. From April-June 2024, sectoral and thematic funds received total inflows of Rs 46,731 crore, the highest among all equity mutual fund categories.Now the question is which sector-based mutual funds are likely to benefit from the budget?“The government needs to maintain a very delicate balance between fueling growth, curbing inflation, and ensuring fiscal discipline. The focus for the government will likely be sectors such as Infrastructure, defence and renewable energies like solar. However, there is also likely to be increased budgetary allocation even for other sectors like BFSI and manufacturing that cannot be ignored,” said Rajesh Minocha.He also adds that, “Investors should not chase sector themes but should focus more on funds that are diversified and funds like business cycle funds. They should leave the sector and stock picking for the fund managers as some of these sectors could be very expensive and their valuation may not be justified.”However, Adhil Shetty believes that, “Based on current discussions and trends, upcoming budget priorities are expected to focus on infrastructure, energy, mobility, housing, digitization and technology sectors. Potential announcements in these areas could have significant implications. The Union Budget on July 23 will reveal specific details and allocations for each sector, shaping expectations and outcomes accordingly.”“Sectors like infrastructure funds, PSU funds, manufacturing funds, and energy funds are likely to be the primary winners from the Union Budget 2024. The anticipated increase in capital expenditure on infrastructure projects will benefit construction and urban development sectors. Public sector undertakings (PSUs) will gain from government modernisation efforts and potential privatization. Additionally, energy funds are expected to benefit from continued investments in clean energy technologies and green initiatives. Manufacturing funds may also see significant benefits from enhancements to the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which aims to boost manufacturing capabilities and support SME growth. Additionally, efforts to boost private sector capex will further enhance the growth prospects for these funds.,” said Sagar Shinde.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/union-budget-2024-what-mutual-fund-investors-expect-from-fm-nirmala-sitharamans-budget/articleshow/111922158.cms

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024 and the Budget is being looked at for relief to salaried, middle class taxpayers and also the common man.What can you expect from the Modi 3.0 government’s Budget 2024? What are the top expectations from an income tax perspective and what do the experts recommend? We take a look:1.Changes in New Income Tax regime: The new income tax regime could be made more attractive by rationalizing the income tax rates and slabs, according to experts. They suggest that the 30% tax slab should be applicable for incomes above Rs 20 or Rs 25 lakh, instead of the current Rs 15 lakh threshold.One of the expectations is the inclusion of Section 80C exemption under the new income tax regime. Additionally, since the limit of Rs 1.5 lakh has not been revised since 2014, there is a request to increase it to Rs 3 lakh to encourage savings.Also Read | How can Budget 2024 make the new income tax regime more attractive for salaried taxpayers? Top points from TOI Online tax experts’ survey Personal tax experts unanimously agree that the standard deduction limit of Rs 50,000, introduced in the new tax regime last year, should be increased to Rs 1 lakh. This revision is particularly crucial as the standard deduction limit has not been updated since the financial year 2019-20.To encourage more taxpayers to opt for the new income tax regime, personal tax experts recommend increasing the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Additionally, some experts propose raising the limit for tax rebate from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh.Tax experts believe that the current exemption limit of Rs 10,000 for interest on bank deposits is insufficient and should be increased. Moreover, they suggest that term deposits and fixed deposits should also be included under this limit.Salaried taxpayers are requesting an increase in the health insurance premium deduction under Section 80D from the current limit of Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000 or even Rs 1 lakh. This change would offer relief to taxpayers and motivate them to prioritize their health, which is especially important in the present circumstances.Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What are the ideal new tax regime slabs, rates for middle class, salaried? TOI Online Survey findings There is a demand to raise the current limit for deduction on interest paid towards housing loan for self-occupied house property from Rs 2 lakh to a minimum of Rs 3 lakh. One ask is also to include this under the new tax regime.Experts note that the government recognizes the intricacies in the current capital gains tax structure, which suffers from inconsistencies in tax rates and holding periods for various instruments within the same asset class. Moreover, the indexation benefit is not uniformly applied across different scenarios. They anticipate that the government may propose a streamlined capital gains tax regime, possibly involving adjustments to tax rates and computation methods.In Budget 2023, the TCS rate was increased from 5% to 20% for certain transactions to curb the outflow of foreign exchange. However, this sharp increase has had a significant impact on many individuals, including employees. The 20% TCS on amounts sent abroad exceeding 7 lakhs for maintenance purposes is causing substantial cash flow problems. Experts recommend lowering the TCS rate from 20% to 10% to alleviate this burden.Experts suggest that the online grievance resolution system for income tax return filing should be streamlined to make it more user-friendly. They also recommend further simplifying the income tax filing process to ease the burden on taxpayers.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/income-tax-expectations-what-can-budget-2024-do-for-salaried-middle-class-taxpayers-and-common-man/articleshow/111935351.cms
indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: “An increased budgetary allocation for hospitality skill development programs is crucial to bridge the talent gap,” says GM of The Leela Bhartiya City, Bangalore, Virender Razdan","The Union Budget 2024 is one of the highly anticipated events that will address the diverse needs of stakeholders, including taxpayers, investors, industries, farmers, women, and major sectors such as FMCG, real estate, and technology. The hospitality sector , in particular, is keenly watching for potential policy changes and incentives that could significantly impact its growth and sustainability.Virender Razdan , General Manager at The Leela Bhartiya City, Bengaluru, shared his insights about his expectations for the budget and its implications for the hospitality industry.Razdan highlighted the critical issue of talent shortage in the post-pandemic travel boom. He stated, ""The post-pandemic boom in travel is a welcome sight, but it exposes a critical fault line in the hospitality industry—a staggering talent shortage. We're looking to fill millions of positions in the coming years, yet the applicant pool simply hasn't kept pace. To bridge this 55-60% gap, we urge the government to invest in hospitality training programs and create a more attractive work environment for young minds. By fostering a skilled workforce, we can ensure a sustainable future for Indian hospitality, capitalize on this exciting growth opportunity, and, of course, support India in entering the $5 trillion GDP club. Hence, an increased budgetary allocation for hospitality skill development programs is crucial to bridge the talent gap .""Virender Razdan also emphasized the importance of granting infrastructure status to the hospitality sector. ""The recent travel boom presents a golden opportunity, but to truly unlock our potential, we need the government to strategically recognize hospitality as an industry and grant infrastructure status to hotels exceeding a certain bar. This will catalyze access to long-term financing at lower interest rates, streamlined regulations for faster project execution, and potential tax breaks for the industry. This isn't just about filling rooms – it's about transforming hospitality into a magnet for investment.""According to him, infrastructure status could significantly benefit the sector. ""Infrastructure status creates a win-win: it incentivizes developers, lowers the cost of capital for new projects, and ultimately fosters a more vibrant hospitality sector that contributes even more to our nation's GDP, job creation, and foreign exchange earnings,"" he concluded.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-an-increased-budgetary-allocation-for-hospitality-skill-development-programs-is-crucial-to-bridge-the-talent-gap-says-gm-of-the-leela-bhartiya-city-bangalore-virender-razdan/articleshow/111923971.cms

(Ashutosh Bhandari is Director & Roshan Yadav is Associate Director, Consulting at CRISIL Market Intelligence & Analytics)

Railway Budget 2024 expectations: Indian Railways does not just bridge distances, it is verily an engine of the country’s economic growth. The Government of India’s decision to not have a separate railway budget has not undermined the role it continues to have and play. While there has been much discussion around Vande Bharat and bullet trains, there have also been occasional concerns raised about the safety of our train operations.Also Read: Income Tax Budget 2024 Live Similarly, while there have been announcements regarding developments under the Amrit Bharat Station scheme and the creation of new Gati Shakti Terminals , there is also heightened demand for new coaches. The time is now for dedicated freight corridors to be fully operational.The railways is poised to enter an exciting phase of freight supremacy by leveraging these corridors for extensive network planning and other strategic gains. New economic corridors have also been announced, but they may take some time to complete.Also Read | Railway Budget 2024: How Budget 2024 can drive Indian Railways’ infrastructure to new heights Now, let’s analyse the trends and factors that are expected to shape the upcoming union budget for the railway sector.The cumulative budget outlay for fiscals 2020-2025 was Rs 8.7 lakh crore. There has been a shortfall of about Rs 5 lakh crore compared with the planned outlay under the National Infrastructure Pipeline of Rs 13.7 lakh crore. The upcoming union budget for fiscal 2025 is expected to make up for this shortfall.Indian Railways was allocated Rs 2.40 lakh crore in Union Budget 2023-2024 and Rs 2.52 lakh crore in Interim Budget 2024-2025. This marks a staggering 75% increase from the fiscal 2022 allocation.The upcoming budget is expected to allocate funds to key priorities such as safety, new coaches, new trains and new corridors. However, it should be noted that revenue expenditure, including staff costs and pensions, is expected to increase steadily.Also Read | Railway Budget 2024: Indian Railways to journey beyond Vande Bharat? Experts suggest focus on non-AC trains, safety Consequently, the operating ratio may increase from the budgeted 98.22% in fiscal 2025, limiting additional capital investments in railways. Accordingly, it remains to be seen whether the focus on allocation for new railway lines, which has grown 21.7% annually since fiscal 2023, will diminish or persist.On the safety front, the budget is likely to maintain its focus, if not enhance it. Additional funding is expected to be allocated to achieve the implementation target for the Kavach anti-collision train system. Kavach has already been deployed on roughly 1,500 km of routes, with an additional 3,000 km currently under implementation.Also expected in the budget are allocations for upgrading conventional coaches to Vande Bharat standards, launching additional Vande Bharat trains, and introducing new trains such as Vande Bharat sleeper and Amrit Bharat Express.The announcement of new economic corridors to improve logistics efficiency is a significant step towards achieving the ambitious target for expanding freight transportation modal share set out in the National Rail Plan. The resultant decongestion of high-traffic corridors will also improve passenger train operations.Also Check | Budget 2024 2024 Live Updates: Economic Survey projects 6.5-7% GDP growth These large-scale corridor projects, high-speed train station redevelopment (Amrit Bharat Station), and ongoing track infrastructure augmentation call for a budgetary top-up.Having seen rapid progress earlier, electrification might not receive as much attention now.The emerging requirement for Indian Railways is to reduce its carbon footprint and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. To meet this requirement, about 30 GW of renewable capacity is required to be installed. As of January 2024, Indian Railways has installed 216.36 MW of solar rooftop capacity and 103.4 MW of wind energy. To become a net-zero emitter, other strategies that Indian Railways could employ include transitioning from diesel to electric, improving energy efficiency, building dedicated freight corridors, supporting afforestation, etc.Private-sector participation in the context of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the railway sector has been limited. The sector has been unable to execute its plans under the National Monetisation Pipeline. Contrastingly, private container train operations have been a success — although it’s an old story. Recently, Gati Shakti multi-modal terminals have also shown success.Look to the budget for initiatives encouraging PPPs, leveraging private sector capital, efficiency and technology.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/railway-budget-2024-expectations-indian-railways-eyes-enhanced-budgetary-support-with-priorities-clearly-defined/articleshow/111931496.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Economic Survey warns about AI's impact on Indian job market,"Economic Survey highlights AI's impact on Indian job market



“The biggest disruption for the future of work is the accelerated growth in AI, which is poised to revolutionise the global economy. India would not remain immune to this transformation. AI is being recognised as a general-purpose technology, like electricity and the internet, which is phenomenal in its rapid pace of innovation and ease of diffusion. As AI systems continue to get smarter and adoption increases, the future of work will be reshaped. While AI has considerable potential for boosting productivity, it also has the potential to disrupt employment in certain sectors. Routine tasks, including customer service, will likely witness a high degree of automation; creative sectors will see extensive usage of AI tools for image and video creation; personalised AI tutors can reshape education and sectors like healthcare can witness accelerated drug discovery.”

How the Economic Survey advises govt to tackle this AI ‘problem’



“India, with its vast demographic dividend and a very young population, is uniquely situated as AI poses both risk and opportunity. According to Capital Economics (2024), the current diffusion and adaptation of AI in India remains low compared to the US, Europe, and the developed Asian economies. The manufacturing sector is less exposed to AI as industrial robots are neither as nimble nor as cost-effective as human labour. In inventory and supply chain management, AI applications could rather be complementary to labour.

Nevertheless, at particular risk is the BPO sector, where GenAI is revolutionising the performance of routine cognitive tasks through chatbots, and employment in the sector is estimated to decline considerably in the next ten years. In the following decade, however, the gradual diffusion of AI is expected to augment productivity. The use of AI to identify health risks out of digitalised health data, predict weather and complement teachers in grading tests and translating texts are some of the development gaps that AI can plug.

Widespread adoption of AI across the services sector can significantly reshape and even

replace jobs. Based on job posting data from India’s largest job website, Copestake, A. et. al.

(2023) interpret a near-exponential increase in the demand for AI-related skills since 2016.

They find that the demand for AI skills by businesses has a negative impact on the need for non-AI roles and on the top percentile of wages, due to the displacement of high-skilled, managerial positions and non-routine, intellectual tasks.

Given the affinity of India’s population to work with technology, as seen with the digital

public infrastructure, proactive interventions by the Government and industry can position

India as a key player in the AI age. Employees or job seekers would need skills beyond

communication, collaboration, and presentation, such as analytical thinking and innovation complex problem solving, critical thinking; learning and self-development; technology design

and programming; and resilience and adaptability, to face the AI challenge.

AI has made significant growth in the agri-tech, industry & automotive, healthcare,

BFSI and retail sectors in India. One of the significant examples is Praman Exchange,

the world’s largest horticulture exchange, powered by Intello Labs which uses computer vision to map the quality of horticulture products. Pramaan’s technology achieves quality assessment

with 95 per cent accuracy, surpassing the manual assessment rate of 70 per cent. This gives the contractors the required time and flexibility to trade from anywhere in the world.

The Government has launched several initiatives to ensure an AI-enabled ecosystem and

to connect AI to the youth of the country. Some of these include ‘Future Skills Prime’, ‘YUVAi:

Youth for Unnati and Vikas with AI’ a national programme for school students and ‘Responsible

AI for Youth 2022’45. A budget of Rs 10,300 crore has been provided in 2024 for the India AI

Mission, a significant move to strengthen the AI ecosystem.”

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget 2024 in the Parliament on July 23. As India braces for the Union Budget 2024, the government has highlighted a looming threat: the potential disruptive impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the country's job market. The government has issued a warning that AI's influence may create major challenges for workers across all skill levels and hinder sustained economic growth.The upcoming budget is expected to address this pressing issue and outline strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of AI while harnessing its potential benefits.The recent Economic Survey 2023-24 stated:The Survey said:",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-economic-survey-warns-about-ais-impact-on-indian-job-market/articleshow/111927964.cms

Budget 2024 for senior citizens : With the Union Budget on the horizon, just like corporates and industry players, senior citizens too are eagerly awaiting as to what is in store for them? The senior citizen population would be looking at reforms that could potentially support in managing their financial burden and enhance the overall quality of life.In recent years, the government has endeavored to streamline the tax system, introducing changes in Budget 2023 aimed at making the new tax regime more appealing and efficient. These efforts included adjustments such as expanding non-taxable income threshold, implementing standard deductions, and revising tax slabs to incorporate lower rates.Looking ahead to Budget 2024, senior citizens have been advocating for reforms that cater specifically to their unique financial needs and challenges. With age there are multiple mental, health and financial issues that are needed to be managed. While the new tax regime has been introduced and policy makers are apparently working towards making it user-friendly for the larger population, senior citizens have also been expecting some key changes to make it viable for them as well.Also Check | Income Tax Budget 2024 Live A key expectation among senior citizens is for a revision in the basic tax exemption limit under the simplified tax regime. Currently, individuals aged 60 years or above are subjected to the same tax slabs as younger taxpayers. Seniors are hopeful that Budget 2024 will raise the basic exemption limit to at least INR 7 lakh per annum. This adjustment aims to lessen the tax burden on elderly taxpayers with limited income sources and various medical and financial aspects to cope up with.Acknowledging the financial challenges seniors face, especially with rising inflation and healthcare costs, policymakers may consider increasing the standard deduction to INR 200,000 for senior citizens, up from the current INR 50,000. This adjustment could help offset medical expenses and deductions from fixed deposits provided under Chapter VIA particularly, as part of the old tax regime. This may be in sync with the government’s strategy of moving the larger population from the old tax regime to the new tax regime.Additionally, Section 194P of the domestic tax law provides for exempting senior citizens aged 75 years and above, from filing income tax returns, subject to certain specified conditions. While the thought behind such provisions needs to be really appreciated, the provision needs a rejig for the larger senior citizen population taking benefit of the same. So, for the benefit to be availed by a larger chunk the section needs to introduce much more dearer provisions.Also Read | How can Budget 2024 make the new income tax regime more attractive for salaried taxpayers? Top points from TOI Online tax experts’ survey Seniors hope for the introduction of dedicated helplines or assistance centers that cater specifically to their needs, offering personalized guidance and support throughout the tax filing process. Furthermore, implementation of user-friendly digital platforms such as portals and mobile applications would facilitate seamless tax compliance and ensure timely refunds for seniors.As the countdown to Budget 2024 begins, the nation is closely monitoring the events, including senior citizens, on what to expect. With this being the first main Budget of the government, a lot is expected in terms of tax reforms. While industries would hope for rebates, tax concessions, tax holidays, senior citizens are looking forward to amendments that can help them take a sigh of relief.

NEW DELHI: Despite emerging as the fastest-growing major economy in recent years, experts still seek Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to take measures in the upcoming Union Budget 2024 to shore up India's weak private consumption figures.The Indian economy grew 8.2 per cent (provisional) in FY24 while private consumption, which includes the spending by households and businesses across the nation, grew at just 4 per cent.Currently, India’s economic growth is largely driven by the government’s robust focus on capital expenditure, which is making up for the significant lag in private consumption. A lower consumption is indicative of a household or business’ savings and ability to spend and such stands to have an impact on a nation’s economy.Put simply, if you don’t spend, the companies won’t produce. If the companies don’t produce, they won’t pay salaries or wages. If they don’t get paid, the government won’t get any taxes.Economists have been quick to point out this stark difference between the headline GDP figure and weak consumer demand. Some media reports have suggested that the government is mulling tax cuts for individuals in certain income brackets as it attempts to fix this gap.National accounts’ estimates show that India's private consumption growth of 4 per cent in FY24 was a 20-year low, excluding the pandemic years. The household consumption survey estimates have seen both rural and urban consumption decelerate in FY23.Select sectoral data in recent months have also highlighted the weakness in recent weeks. For example, auto retail in India dropped to a two-and-a-half-year low in June. Auto sales are regarded as a significant indicator of private consumption in India. According to government data, the country's auto industry contributes 7 per cent to the GDP.""Rising frequency of weather disruptions, including in 2023 - leading to weaker agriculture incomes; persistent high food inflation – eating into households’ discretionary spending; and an incomplete service sector recovery – leading to weaker employment opportunities in urban areas, are key factors behind the slowdown in household consumption,"" Dipti Deshpande, Principal Economist, CRISIL told ET Online.Food inflation remains a worry for the Reserve Bank of India, given its volatile nature and weight in the overall inflation calculations.Consumption worries are not necessarily confined to rural areas, as RBI’s consumer confidence survey for urban areas reflects some weakness in sentiments for the current period.""While the high-income category has been spending, the lower-income category has been cautious in their consumption spending. Weak hiring by some of the sectors like IT also dampened consumer sentiments,"" Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist, CareEdge said.""The dichotomy between the slower growth in consumption at 4 per cent and the economic growth of over 8 per cent can be explained by the 'K-shaped' growth since Covid, where the affluent are driving the activity,"" PTI cited UBS Securities' chief India Economist Tanvee Gupta Jain.Among the many suggestions, economists have suggested that the government has to focus both on short-term, and long-term. ""In the upcoming budget, in addition to the continued thrust on capex – which will pave the way for durable long-term growth, some steps to lift growth in the short term are expected to help,"" Deshpande said.Among the short-term measures, Rajani Sinha suggested that the government could provide some tax reliefs to the lower-income category as it could boost consumer sentiments and propel their spendings.""The government has the challenging task of balancing fiscal prudence while continuing the focus on capex induced growth. Keeping that in mind it will be a tightrope walk for the government. Focussed measures for rural economy like boosting rural infrastructure and rural income should help improve rural demand that has been a bane for the economy,"" Sinha added.On other hand, Deshpande highlighted that the years before and during the Covid-19 pandemic saw large spending under schemes such as PMAY, PMGSY and NREGA. ""These schemes are not only employment generating but also asset creating. In addition, they cushion the rural economy in times of weather distress. Spends under these heads saw some normalisation post the pandemic, as the economy recovered,"" Deshpande said.Experts have also suggested as the private consumption growth is currently lagging, core inflation is benign and the overall growth is strong enough to enable the Narendra Modi government's fiscal consolidation path, the option to leverage the additional fiscal buffer from higher-than-expected RBI dividend of Rs 2.11 lakh crore for welfare spending may be a reasonable choice.With the long-term in mind, the government has been asked to look at measures to fix employment gaps.""Over a longer period, the most crucial aspect would be improvement in employment scenario. This will help improve consumer sentiments on a sustained basis. The new government should focus on creating more job opportunities in the organised and unorganised sector. It will also be critical for the government to skill the population adequately to enable them to get absorbed in the labour force,"" Sinha said.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/union-budget-2024-income-tax-cut-modi-govt-may-push-big-reforms-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-economic-survey/articleshow/111915894.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: What the Indian gaming industry looks forward to,"As the Modi 3.0 government prepares to unveil its first Union Budget of the new term on July 23, 2024, the Indian gaming and esports industry is poised with anticipation, hoping for favourable policies and tax relief to propel its growth trajectory. Industry leaders are calling for measures that could potentially transform India into a global gaming powerhouse.The sector's primary expectations revolve around tax incentives , clear regulatory frameworks, and increased funding for esports.A consortium of 70 Indian gaming companies recently petitioned the Prime Minister's Office and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, proposing a reduction in GST on video games from 18% to 12%, aiming to enhance sustainability and improve cash flow for game developers.Rajan Navani, Chairman and President of the Indian Digital Gaming Society backed by the CII, emphasised the sector's potential: ""The esports and video gaming sector in India is brimming with potential. We have a massive pool of talented gamers, but to truly compete globally, we need targeted support in the upcoming budget. This includes tax breaks for studios creating original esports and video gaming content, investment in infrastructure to foster development of high-quality games, and initiatives to cultivate a skilled esports workforce.""Akshat Rathee, Co-founder and MD of NODWIN Gaming, highlighted the distinct needs of gaming and esports. ""With esports now under national and international sports federations, it would benefit from increased investment in the sports budget and inclusion in national games such as Khelo India,"" Rathee stated. He also emphasized the potential for esports to win India medals in international competitions.The industry is seeking clarity on the classification between real money games (RMG) and video games, a distinction crucial for appropriate regulation and taxation. Rohit Agarwal, Founder and Director of Alpha Zegus, noted, ""We might see updates regarding the regularization of the RMG segment and changes in policy structures/tax slabs for the same.""Tax incentives for game developers are high on the wishlist. Roby John, CEO of SuperGaming, said, ""We hope the upcoming budget will recognize this potential and introduce measures that support game development, infrastructure, and talent development."" He believes such initiatives could position India as a global leader in the gaming industry.The establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) for gaming hardware manufacturing is another key expectation. Vishal Parekh, COO of CyberPowerPC India, suggested that the government should ""enhance investments in building digital infrastructure and establishing Special Economic Zones dedicated to the manufacturing of PC and gaming equipment.""Industry stakeholders are also advocating for the recognition of Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming and Comics (AVGC) intellectual property as bankable assets. Deepak Ail, CEO of Dot9 Games, called for ""appropriate policies so that the Indian video game industry will emerge as a significant exporter and contributor to the nation's goal of achieving a 10-trillion-dollar economy by 2047.""Education and skill development in the gaming sector are also areas of focus. Shalin Shodhan, CEO of Masala Games, hopes the government will consider ""supporting video game development by adding it to educational curriculums and skill development initiatives.""While optimism runs high, some industry insiders caution against expecting sweeping changes. However, the gaming industry remains hopeful that the government will acknowledge its potential and introduce supportive measures. The sector sees itself not just as an entertainment industry, but as a significant contributor to India's digital economy and global soft power, capable of creating jobs and driving innovation in the years to come.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-what-the-indian-gaming-industry-looks-forward-to/articleshow/111898858.cms

Parliament monsoon session begins tomorrow i.e. July 22. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will table the union budget on July 23. It will be the union government’s first budget after May 2024 elections results. Ahead of the union budget 24-25, the cryptocurrency community is pressing for several key changes that could significantly impact the industry.A report by Economic Times states that these proposals aim to create a more favorable environment for cryptocurrency trading and blockchain technology adoption in the country.Key demands of the crypto community includes:A key proposal of the crypto community is to decrease the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) rate on Virtual Digital Asset (VDA) transfers under section 194S from 1% to 0.01%. The current TDA rate, the report states, acts as a deterrent for investors, leading to reduced market liquidity and participation. Reducing this rate the crypto currency community says can stimulate more transactions and promote a more robust trading environment.Furthermore, the community has recommended to reconsider the tax deduction threshold under Section 194S. It proposes an increase from Rs 50,000 to Rs 5,00,000.Stakeholders in the cryptocurrency sector have further advised to offset and carry forward losses, similar to other industries. At present, losses from Virtual Digital Asset (VDA) trading can't be carried forward to balance future VDA gains or other income, which hampers long-term investment and strategic trading decisions.

Pushing EV adoption through hybrids

Supporting R&D

Budget 2024 auto sector expectations: As the country eagerly awaits Union Budget 2024-25 , the first by the new NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the auto industry seeks continued support. In the past, the government has provided impetus to the industry through multiple incentives schemes like Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME), Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, and more.Many major brands have taken advantage of the supportive policy environment for EVs and have set up or expanded manufacturing facilities. Several others are planning to set up operations here. The industry grew 19% in value in FY24 from the previous year, to reach Rs 10.2 lakh crore. As the industry gears up for the opportunities within India and other global markets, it looks towards additional support from the government to increase competitiveness at the global level and boost domestic demand, making India the world's leading auto manufacturing hub.In the long term, the government aims for a much larger share for electric mobility, which aligns with our environmental imperatives. At the same time, there are near-term concerns that need to be addressed to boost EV adoption.. Electric Vehicle production and sales have grown rapidly because of policy support so far but need a few additional measures to develop and solidify the EV ecosystem. This includes financing for charging infrastructure, battery swapping stations, and R&D in EV technology. Additionally, to ensure competitiveness, the sector is looking for an extension of concessional import duties on lithium-ion cells, a crucial EV component. Incentivising domestic battery production offers dual benefits: one, it can lower the cost of EVs, and two, reduce our reliance on imports.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income Tax changes, record capex for roads and railways expected from FM Nirmala Sitharaman EV manufacturers operating under the Manufacture and Other Operations in Warehouse Regulations (MOOWR) licenses currently face a double whammy.The EV manufacturers under the MOOWR licence are liable to bear tax cost on inputs, i.e., GST on imported components, and embedded tax cost on procurements from India. However, on their exports, they are not eligible for the benefit of refunds on embedded taxes and duties available under the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme. The industry expectation is that this imbalance will be resolved and MOOWR-licensed EV manufacturers will get a level playing field which will ensure that they have a competitive edge, exports get a boost and consumers gain from affordable EVs.High GST and income tax collections present an opportunity for tax relief for automakers and component manufacturers. To boost manufacturing, a concessional corporate tax rate of 15% for new manufacturing companies was introduced in 2019 and its sunset date was last extended till 31 March 2024.Therefore, the industry also seeks further extension of the concessional income tax benefits for newly established manufacturing companies for another year at the least.Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What are the ideal new tax regime slabs, rates for middle class, salaried? TOI Online Survey findings The industry is bogged down by complex customs procedures specifically relating to HS Classification, valuation, interpretation of exemption notifications and strict compliance of conditions to avail these exemption. To improve ease of doing business (EoDB), a one-time amnesty scheme for resolving long-pending litigation can be introduced.Though GST is not part of the Union Budget exercise and all matters relating to it get decided only in GST Council meetings, the Union Finance Minister is the head of the GST council. This is why it makes sense to look at the GST issues also in this article here. To push Indian consumers towards EV consumption, hybrid vehicles play a critical role in changing the preferences. However, the Compensation Cess presently for four wheelers exceeding 1200 CC and length exceeding 4000 mm, is as high as 15%. It is important to bring down the Compensation Cess to promote sale of hybrids.While several points on the wish-list hold near-term benefits, over the long term, it is crucial that India supports R&D in the sector. Rapid technological advancements are disrupting the auto sector. With internal combustion engine vehicles facing increasing competition from EVs, hybrids, and hydrogen fuel cell technology, Indian manufacturers are investing heavily in R&D. Incentives, cashbacks, or weighted deductions on income tax to offset R&D costs will promote the development of new-age vehicles. Moreover, higher levels of connectivity, software and electronic content in vehicles is also driving innovation. To reduce dependence on imports and foreign technology, it is important to support indigenous EV cell production and technology. Scalable solutions will also add fuel to exports.The Indian auto industry, with a turnover of Rs 20 lakh crore, is one of India’s biggest manufacturing success stories. By addressing the concerns raised, this budget can help the industry maintain as well as build on its current momentum in the global manufacturing landscape.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-expectations-for-auto-sector-auto-industry-seeks-support-for-its-growing-ambitions/articleshow/111900856.cms

Railway Budget 2024: What else needs to be done?

Railway Budget 2024 : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024 and the government is expected to continue with its capital expenditure push for infrastructure, with Indian Railways and the roadways being major beneficiaries. Since 2017, no separate Railway Budget has been presented and FM Sitharaman’s Budget 2024 speech will be looked at for the future plans for Indian Railways.In the Interim Budget 2024, the Modi government had allocated a record Rs 2,52,000 crore for capital expenditure for Indian Railways in FY 2024-25.Experts believe that a record capex push for railways is a foregone conclusion, but what’s of paramount importance is the projects on which this capital expenditure is made.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income Tax changes, record capex for roads and railways expected from FM Nirmala Sitharaman All experts unanimously agree that the capital expenditure allocation for Indian Railways should focus on augmenting safety on the network, especially implementation of the Kavach anti-collision system .Sudhanshu Mani, the creator of Train 18 or Vande Bharat says, “Most importantly, there is a need to provide a fillip to safety, with faster implementation of Kavach and use of artificial intelligence for safety audits.”G Raghuram, Professor Emeritus at Gujarat Maritime University, and a railway expert tells TOI, “The budget 2024-25 for the railway sector needs to give a high priority for safety, followed by capacity augmentation.”“Be it Kavach, maintenance of rolling stock, tracks and signals, training of key operating manpower, use of data analytics and studies to identify contexts that are vulnerable to safety, black boxes and camera installations in trains, quicker response equipment for post accident support,” he elaborates.Manish Sharma, Partner and Leader, Infrastructure, Transport and Logistics, PwC India is of the view that the increased capex and its accelerated implementation will be needed for upgradation of safety measures such as Kavach and advanced signalling, and the budget should have a special allocation for this pressing need.Also Read | Cheer for common man! Indian Railways to manufacture almost 10,000 non-AC coaches in 2 years to meet growing demand Moving beyond the introduction of the Vande Bharat class of trains, railway experts advocate focus on non air-conditioned passenger travel.Shri Prakash, Retired Railway Board Member says that apart from the Vande Bharat type trains that serve a particular market niche, the government should make massive investments for procurement of general service coaches, sitting as well as sleeper coaches for long and middle distance segments to control the heavy overcrowding. The demand is much more than the supply, he says.“⁠The government should equally give emphasis on introduction of short distance branch line passenger trains, their shortages are massive on almost all over the country,” he tells TOI.Manish Sharma of PwC says that besides capex, enhancing customer experience is important through improved facilities, cleanliness, seat availability and even dynamic pricing models.“Besides Vande Bharat trains , the launch of non-AC passenger trains featuring push-pull technology is needed under the Amrit Bharat Scheme, to address larger public transportation needs,” he adds.Sudhanshu Mani notes that it is important that one starts seeing tangible benefits of this expenditure - in terms of better revenue, more freight being carried and faster passenger trains. “The much-delayed big ticket projects like J&K rail line, DFC and high-speed rail project need to be expedited. Finally, upgradation of tracks for higher speeds of trains is also important,” he tells TOI.Also Check | Top Luxury Train In India! Jaw Dropping Pics of Maharajas' Express - Most Expensive Train by IRCTC Shri Prakash says that for freight revenue to improve, ⁠Indian Railways has to aggressively increase its commodity basket entering into non-bulk traffic market.Shri Prakash pitches for an increase in railway fares. “⁠The government should increase passenger fares at par with bus fares to cut down the losses. For this passenger fares that are uniformly applicable throughout the country should be decentralised empowering zonal administration to fix fares according to market conditions,” he advises.Manish Sharma says that the Budget should continue to support and enhance capital expenditure in modernisation of Indian Railways. “The acceleration of capex for capacity augmentation is very critical for railways as it will enable them to employ a host of new strategies and interventions to drive modal shift, and stay competitive against other modes of transport for attracting freight and passenger traffic,” he tells TOI.Lastly, railways need to signal a stringent intent to attract PPP, not just to mobilise extra-budgetary resources but also to leverage private sector efficiency in delivery of services, Sharma says. “Besides conventional PPP concessions, models like asset recycling, and where suitable instruments like InvITs should be explored to attract different categories of private sector participants,” he adds.G Raghuram says, “Towards capacity, investments to streamline traffic flows are important. Rolling stock investments need to be made keeping in mind export opportunities. There is a need for better focus on research and development involving academic institutions.”",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/railway-budget-2024-indian-railways-to-journey-beyond-vande-bharat-experts-suggest-focus-on-non-ac-trains-safety/articleshow/111906333.cms

The Modi government gave middle class Indians big dreams when it introduced the UDAN Scheme (Udega Desh ka Aam Nagrik) in 2016 - aimed at developing regional connectivity and making domestic flight tickets affordable.However, the government’s flagship programme took a serious hit when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a 60 per cent decrease in funds to Rs 502 crore in February’s interim budget . Another scheme, Krishi UDAN , which was introduced to assist farmers in transporting agricultural produce received no funds.The reduction in funds came even as the government reiterated that the implementation of air connectivity to tier-two and tier-three cities under the scheme has been extensive.. The country’s new Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu has said that his aim is to make air travel affordable for all.“With travel returning at pace in India, it has indeed been an exciting period of time for India’s aviation and tourism sectors. To cater to the robust growth in travel volumes, particularly from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities within the country, 15 airport projects have already been announced across key destinations over the last quarter,” said Sumit Prakash, Country Director, India and South Asia, Collinson International, a company that works with travel and hospitality brands around the world.“This is further complemented by the inauguration of new airports, new terminals being developed at existing airports and the expansion of flight routes,” Prakash added.While the government has continued its effort in boosting regional connectivity, the success of schemes has been questionable. Former Minister of State for the Ministry of Civil Aviation V K Singh had said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha that out of the 1,300 valid routes under UDAN, 501 were cancelled. The reasons included shutting down of airlines and non-readiness of airports. Only 201 routes have completed the prescribed three year tenure.Airlines registered with the scheme are provided with benefits from the central and state governments, as well as the Airport Authority of India in the form of tax concessions, airport charges, and viability gap funding, if there is a shortfall of revenue while operating on UDAN routes. However, country’s leading airline Indigo cut short the number of flights under the scheme in the previous year.“We hope to see increased investment in infrastructure that enhances connectivity and accessibility, especially in emerging travel destinations,” said Shikhar Aggarwal, JMD, BLS International services Ltd Like in all other parts of the world, India’s aviation industry was severely affected during the Covid-19 pandemic. With the world shutting down for months, many airlines saw their bottom lines plummet - causing them to ground flights and cancel routes.However, national air passenger numbers have slowly recovered since then, now crossing the pre-pandemic numbers.In FY24, airports in Diu, Patnanagar, Agra, and Shillong witnessed a passenger footfall growth of 40-60 per cent, signifying the growing demand for air travel. Tezpur broke all records with an increase of 702 per cent in passenger traffic. It was 4,000 in FY23, and went up to 32,000 in FY24.“The past few years have underscored the sector's resilience and adaptability, and we are optimistic about its potential. Yet, we firmly believe that strategic government support is crucial to fully harnessing this potential,” said BLS’ Aggarwal.The upcoming Union Budget will give an indication of what lies ahead for the government’s flagship UDAN project and India’s aviation sector as a whole.The government has joined hands with the private sector in order to create better flight and airport operations.“We need a cohesive approach that would encompass the public and private sector on one hand, and the government (state and central governments, and local authorities) on the other hand, in order to continue developing world class tourism infrastructure,” Aggarwal said.Another factor on people’s expenditure on travel is tax. With lesser income tax, the common man will have a better disposable income.“The government should bring in changes such as reduction in income tax and related exemptions which could also benefit the sector to a great extent by creating a favourable environment for people to spend their disposable income on travel,” added Aggarwal. .The government, in the Union Budget, must also focus on indigenous production of aeroplane parts to reduce duties and lower the cost of aircraft.""A significant trend in recent budget allocations is the emphasis on modernisation and indigenisation. This development not only promises to elevate passenger experience but also significantly boost tourism and create myriad economic opportunities. We are excited to contribute to this new chapter in India's aviation story, ensuring seamless travel for all,"" said Kapil Bardeja, CEO and Co-Founder, of Vehant Technologies.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/will-udan-finally-get-wings-to-fly-or-will-budget-2024-clip-it-further/articleshow/111903710.cms

Budget 2024 pharmaceutical industry expectations: As India awaits the Union Budget 2024 and announcements that will propel the country towards becoming ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the pharmaceutical industry is also looking forward to fiscal policies and allocations that will make it a US$130 billion-industry by 2030 and US$450 billion by 2047.While the Interim Budget 2024 focused on a healthier future, increasing allocations for Ayushman Bharat (PMAB-Health Infrastructure Mission and the PM Jan Arogya Yojana), it is imperative that higher allocations towards public health continue. The National Health Policy 2017 had recommended the target of 2.5% of GDP by 2025.The industry, therefore, has some key expectations from the Union Budget 2024, which will provide further impetus to this sunrise sector and contribute to the nation’s future.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income Tax changes, record capex for roads and railways expected from FM Nirmala Sitharaman Innovation is key if India is to continue being the world’s pharmacy as also to meet our domestic needs. As per the Department of Pharmaceuticals, 62research papers have been published in May 2024, which clearly indicates India’s potential in R&D. However, R&D not only requires great intellectual prowess but also substantial financial investment.The Indian pharma industry spends about 8.4% of total sales value on R&D against 11%-12% globally, according to a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce. To lower the financial barriers to investing in R&D, in addition to increasing the budget allocation towards R&D, a tax holiday can be provided and weighted tax deduction on R&D expenditure can be restored.At present, 32 approvals are needed to commercialize an emerging product. Simplifying the process of regulatory approvals will reduce the time to market and enhance the industry’s competitiveness.The existing Patent Box Regime (PBR) promotes innovation as the resident inventor gets tax concessions on royalty income at the rate of 10% plus surcharge and cess as applicable. However, amending some of its provisions will maintain a fair and sustainable tax system. There is a need to specifically include patents developed in India and registered in a foreign country for PBR benefits. For instance, PBR benefits on royalty attributable to patents developed in India but registered in the US or registered in both the countries.Similarly, clarification is needed for the term 'Eligible Assessee’ to include a patentee/inventor who is resident in India and controls R&D activity outsourced in India or outside India. Further, special incentives such as subsidies or weighted deduction for R&D expenditure can also help companies that undertake R&D on rare diseases. There are 7,000–8,000 rare diseases, but less than 5% have therapies available to treat them. Due to their low prevalence, these diseases have historically received less attention in terms of R&D.The Indian pharmaceutical industry ranks thirdglobally in production by volume. But the scarcity of medicines for some period during the pandemic put our dependence on imports in focus. Allocating more funds to establish Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) parks and promote domestic manufacturing will support an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and ‘Make in India’ initiatives. For the industry to build a resilient and globally competitive manufacturing ecosystem, export and other incentives are a major factor. For example, extension of profit linked tax benefits for a longer duration for specific states and reduced tax rate of 15% to new manufacturing units of existing companies. Policy measures can boost domestic manufacturing through public procurement orders and phased manufacturing programmes.Despite India being one of the lead exporters of generic medicines, the majority of our population lacks sufficient access to affordable medicines. There is a need to allocate more funds to make quality medications available at affordable prices. The scope of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) can also be expanded, and the number of Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) can be increased to cater to a larger population.In the pharma industry, ease of doing business (India ranked 63 in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report 2020) can be improved in several cases. Globally, healthcare practitioners provide free physician samples to demonstrate drug efficacy and gain experience regarding the drugs. In India as well, free medical samples distributed by pharma companies to healthcare practitioners for testing/ acquiring experience can be excluded from the ambit of Section 194R, which requires a person to deduct tax on benefit or perquisite arising from business or profession, to bring it in line with the prevailing trade practices. Similarly, Input Tax Credit (ITC) on free samples and on destruction of expired goods can be allowed.Further, there is an additional compliance burden on taxpayers as the tax department collects information in terms of TCS at the time of sale of goods under Section 206C(1H) as well as TDS under Section 194Q at the time of purchase of goods. The TCS compliance can be removed, since the tax department would already have the details based on TDS.The Indian healthcare sector is the seventh biggest emitter of climate footprint globally. Therefore, a shift towards sustainability must go hand in hand with ‘Make in India’ initiatives.

Ahead of the Union Budget child rights activists and organisations have urged the government to put children at the centre of the development discourse and increase funding for their education healthcare , and protection services.Child rights activists expressed hope that the government will heed their calls for a child-centric approach, ensuring the nation's youngest citizens receive the resources and protection they need to thrive.The Union Budget will be tabled on Tuesday.Puja Marwaha, CEO of CRY - Child Rights and You, stressed the significance of putting children at the centre of the development discourse.""Children constitute more than one-third of the overall Indian population, and investing in them can foster social equity and break the cycle of poverty,"" she said.Marwaha called for increased allocations for health and nutrition programs, such as the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, especially for children belonging to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).In the realm of education, Marwaha pointed out to the setbacks caused by the Covid pandemic, which led to increased school dropouts and significant educational loss.She urged the government to increase public expenditure on education, in line with the commitments of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.""We have seen a positive move with the increase in allocation for school education by Rs 5,356 crore from 2022-23 to 2023-24, but more resources are needed for initiatives like the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA),"" she added.Furthermore, Marwaha pointed to the importance of initiatives like the Mission Vatsalya and Mission Shakti.""The Union Government's Mission Vatsalya requires matching investment to ensure the well-being of children and reduce vulnerabilities to abuse, neglect, and exploitation,"" she said.She also advocated for increased investment under Mission Shakti, focusing on components like ""Beti Bachao Beti Padhao"".Sudarshan Suchi, CEO of Bal Raksha Bharat, emphasised the need for a substantial increase in funding for education, healthcare, and child protection services.""A focused and comprehensive investment in these areas is crucial to ensuring every child in India has the opportunity to thrive and contribute to the nation's future,"" he stated.Suchi also highlighted the importance of vocational training programs to build a skilled workforce that meets modern industry demands.Bhuwan Ribhu, founder of Child Marriage Free India, called for an increase in budgetary allocation to end child marriage and prevent child sexual abuse.""To translate the dream of child protection into reality, the government needs to allocate a supplementary amount of Rs 19,979 crore annually, an increase of merely 0.4 percent compared to the 2023-24 Union Budget,"" Ribhu emphasised.He also highlighted the need to augment the capacity of police, increase the number of courts, and fast-track the delivery of justice in crimes against women and children.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/budget-2024-child-rights-activists-seek-increased-funding/articleshow/111900507.cms

Budget can help India’s EV biz match up with China

A new boost to India’s EV industry



The upcoming Union Budget 2024 is likely to draw the roadmap to accelerate India’s electric vehicle ambitions, with the Narendra Modi government targetting 30 per cent of auto sales shares by 2030 to be that of electric variety.From allocating a higher budget for EVs’ expansion to extending related subsidy schemes, the Modi government is expected to undertake several initiatives to see its EV goal through, as per experts.India’s EV acceleration has been backed by the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) policy for electric two, three, and four-wheelers, which could receive a budgetary allocation of about Rs 10,000 crore, people familiar with the deliberations told ET.The Ministry of Heavy Industry, which administers the scheme, has already sent a plan for vetting to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). A final call on the proposal, however, will be taken closer to the budget, keeping the fiscal situation in view, reported ET quoting its sources.Read more: What Modi govt can do in Budget 2024 to fix India's skilling-led unemployment crisis Industry players were expecting Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to elaborate on the FAME-III policy come July 23, however, Union Minister HD Kumaraswamy recently said that policy formulation is in the last stages and might not find a mention during the Budget announcement.The new coalition government is likely considering allocating a larger fund for faster adoption of EVs in the main budget in July 2024, ET recently reported citing people in the know.Recently, the stakeholders of the EV Industry and the Ministry of Heavy Industries proposed the extension of the EV subsidy scheme with a focus on public electric transportation and the expansion of charging stations.Stakeholders and experts have sought incentivising capital expenditure on EVs, increasing depreciation rates on plant and machinery and rationalising GST rates on EVs and its components, ahead of the upcoming Budget 2024-25.Read More: Union Budget: Defence awaits budget ammo, roadmap to 2030 as India guns for ambitious export target ""ACMA is looking forward to a growth-oriented budget with continued thrust on reforms and infrastructure development. Schemes such as the PLI have been of great support to the automotive industry, and we are hopeful that such measures will be continued,” said ACMA President & CMD Subros Ltd , Shradha Suri Marwah.Despite nascent developments in India’s EV infrastructure, there has been a positive reciprocation for the electric variety.The overall sales of electric passenger vehicles jumped 91 per cent year-on-year to 90,996 units in FY24, while the retail sales of electric commercial vehicles rose three-fold in the same time, according to automotive dealers' body FADA.However, for the users in India to adopt EVs widely in the country on a sustainable and long-term basis, there is a need to address the infrastructural cost.“The fundamental problem of charging infrastructure needs to be addressed. The government should classify charging infrastructure under the infrastructure industry,” said Ashish Bagadia, Partner, Corporate Finance and Investment Banking at BDO India.“The main cost of EV charging setup requires three elements: electricity, real estate, and financing. While the government cannot control electricity and real estate charges, it should work on reducing the cost of financing. By classifying charge point operators under priority sector lending, the financing cost can be reduced,” Bagadia added.The company with the biggest share in India’s evolving EV industry, Tata Motors , expects policy continuity to make the EV industry self-sufficient, in the forthcoming Union Budget.Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Motors Electric Mobility said, ""As far as the budget expectation is concerned, the government has been crystal clear and supportive of accelerated penetration of electric mobility in the country. We have schemes such as GST and PLI, among others.”Read More: Budget 2024: With China's real estate reforms in place, is it time for India to up the ante too in Budget? He further advised that the government policy on EVs should continue until 15-20 per cent penetration level is reached in the electric vehicle space. ""So what we would expect (in the Union Budget) is that the policy continues till this (electric vehicle) industry becomes self-sufficient,"" Chandra noted.Chandra added that there should be a stronger focus on policy support towards charging infrastructure, which is one of the "" barriers"" for electric vehicle penetration.In addition, the success of EV penetration in India is incumbent on infrastructure. With sparse charging stations, EV holders may find themselves in a tight spot as soon as their battery depletes.“Batteries constitute 40 per cent of the cost of EVs. The government has helped battery makers through PLI and other schemes and it should allow these measures to deliver results. Accelerated depreciation benefits or tax exemptions would be beneficial in reducing the total cost of ownership. Some of these measures will also help pace the fund outflow from the government exchequer,” said Bagadia.India is currently not a hub for EV battery manufacturing unlike China, which dominates the sector globally. To address the persisting issue, the government has implemented policy initiatives and joint collaborations between Indian and international firms among others to set up production facilities.“Despite creating a market for EVs and thus battery demand, these policies can only go so far in promoting adoption and growth. Therefore, there is a need for long-term policy and regulatory support. This support should focus on streamlining the establishment and operation of battery manufacturing facilities while ensuring that environmental regulations strike a balance between sustainability and industrial growth,” said Thirumalai NC, Sector Head – Strategic Studies at Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP).Read More: Budget 2024: Will Sitharaman give a higher dose of allocation for healthcare this time around? The Ministry of Heavy Industry recently informed the Rajya Sabha that the entire budgeted allocation under FAME II was used up in the first three years, beginning from 2019-20, falling marginally in 2022-23. Despite being a vote on account budget, there was a 44 per cent slash in the budget allocation for FAME-III.FM Sitharaman in February 2024 during the Interim budget announcement allocated nearly Rs 2,671 crore for its flagship FAME scheme but details of it are likely to be announced by the newly-formed government in the main budget in July 2024, experts are hoping.Recently, the government announced the Rs 500 crore Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) 2024 plan to subsidise two and three-wheelers. The EMPS scheme extended incentives of up to Rs 10,000 per electric two-wheeler, and up to Rs 50,000 per electric three-wheeler.In addition, per unit subsidies under both these categories have been scaled down to less than half of what was being offered under FAME-II.EMPS sops were available only to companies with an established local manufacturing capacity in India. This was a deviation from FAME-II, which hinged on a phased manufacturing programme (PMP) to progressively increase local EV-making capabilities.In addition to these, the EMPS was extended only to those vehicles fitted with advanced batteries to prevent mishaps.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/union-budget-2024-can-draw-a-roadmap-to-spark-indias-electric-vehicle-revolution/articleshow/111903441.cms

As India prepares to unveil its Union Budget for 2024-25, expectations are high for measures that will stimulate economic growth and attract foreign investment. Businesses are waiting with bated breath to see what reforms and reliefs are introduced for the financial year ahead. It is expected that Union Budget would be an agent of change in ushering India towards the long-enumerated feat of realizing $5 trillion economy by the government.This budget is poised to be a crucial step in India's journey towards becoming a major global economic player, with several key areas in focus specifically Foreign Direct Investment FDI ) being at the forefront for budgetary considerations. Recent years have seen the once-roaring river of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) slow to a trickle, a trend that has set alarm bells ringing in the corridors of power. It is expected that upcoming budget may relax regulations for critical sectors such as defense, insurance, and plantations thereby attracting more investments. These changes would streamline processes and make India a more attractive destination for foreign capital, aligning with the country's goals of ""Atmanirbhar Bharat"" and ""Viksit Bharat” by 2047.As the budget approaches, there are expectations for meaningful policy changes to address these issues. Stakeholders anticipate reforms that will not only halt the decline but also enhance India's appeal as a global investment destination. The 2024 Budget presents an opportunity to refine India's FDI strategy, streamline regulations, and create a more inviting environment for foreign investors. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, central to India's manufacturing revival strategy, is set for a significant boost. In the recently concluded interim budget, the Indian government has increased the allocation by 33% increase for the PLI schemes for FY25, raising it to ₹6,200 crore from ₹4,645 crore the previous year. This enhancement is expected to bolster manufacturing across 14 key sectors, including mobile phones, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and electronics. Industry experts anticipate an expansion of the PLI scheme into new sectors such as toys, textiles, apparel, and commercial aircraft manufacturing, with a focus on increasing domestic value addition and creating employment opportunities.The forthcoming Union Budget holds high expectations for measures to enhance ease of doing business, with a strong focus on rationalizing regulations to attract inbound investments. Key proposals anticipated include streamlining tax policies and simplifying compliance requirements to foster a conducive environment for private equity investments. By creating a robust ecosystem that supports increased influx of funds, India can strengthen investor confidence. Enhancing the tax and regulatory landscape is critical, as it directly impacts investment decisions. These reforms are expected to not only accelerate economic growth but also position India as a premier destination for global investors, driving sustainable development and innovation.Recent statistics highlight the pressing need for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) reforms in India. In 2023, India experienced a significant 43% decrease in FDI inflows, with the figure dropping to $28 billion. This decline occurred against a backdrop of modest 2% global reduction, emphasizing India's challenges in attracting foreign investment. The impact of this downturn is evident in India's global FDI rankings. The country's position fell from 8th in 2022 to 15th in 2023, signaling a need for immediate policy recalibration. This recent performance contrasts sharply with the previous year, i.e. 2022, wherein India saw a 10% increase in FDI inflows, reaching $49 billion. The reversal underscores the volatility of global investment trends and the importance of maintaining a competitive investment environment.For the upcoming union budget, facilitative and business-friendly tax reforms will also be at the forefront of the government's agenda. Expectations from Indian Inc include an extension of the sunset date for the 15% tax regime for new manufacturing entities. This regime has been instrumental in enhancing India's appeal as an investment destination for both domestic and global investors, spurring increased production and job creation. The grapevine is abuzz with speculation about doubling the long-term capital gains exemption threshold. Such a bold step could inject a fresh dose of confidence into the veins of the investor community, potentially unleashing a tidal wave of capital market investments and foreign inflows.To sustain the momentum of GDP growth and ensure its replication with manifold impact in the coming times, key budget expectations include a further reduction in corporate tax rates to align with global standards, thereby encouraging both domestic and foreign companies to invest in India. Streamlining and simplifying tax compliance procedures is crucial to reducing the administrative burden on businesses, making it easier for companies to operate in the country. Additionally, introducing tax incentives for investments in renewable energy, green technologies, and sustainable business practices will attract environmentally conscious investors. Offering tax reliefs and incentives for key sectors such as technology, healthcare, and agriculture is expected to attract sector-specific investments.Providing additional tax benefits and incentives for research and development activities will encourage innovation and attract high-tech industries. Implementing favorable tax policies and incentives for startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) is essential to fostering entrepreneurship and attracting venture capital. Expanding and renegotiating tax treaties with other countries will help prevent double taxation and provide certainty to international investors, thereby making India a more attractive destination for inbound investments. Finally, further reforms to improve the ease of doing business in India, including faster regulatory approvals, better protection of intellectual property rights, and enhanced dispute resolution mechanisms, may result in a more conducive investment environment.As the D-Day approaches, the 2024-25 Union Budget looms as a watershed moment in India's economic journey. With its strategic focus on attracting foreign investments, supercharging manufacturing through the PLI scheme, offering enticing tax reforms, and addressing structural issues, this budget holds the potential to unlock India's economic prowess. The global community watches intently as India's policymakers undertake the formidable task of crafting a budget that can truly catalyze change, potentially propelling the nation into the upper echelons of global economic players.This budget represents more than just fiscal planning; it embodies India's ambition to redefine its economic landscape and solidify its position on the world stage. The success of these initiatives could not only accelerate India's growth trajectory but also establish it as the preferred destination for global investors in the years to come. As former Indian president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam aptly said, 'The country doesn't deserve anything less than success from us. Let us aim for success.' Giving these thoughts a reminder, the India Inc expectations continue to circle from lawmakers for a budget that fuel the economic mileage and generate dividends of prosperity thereby acting as a yardstick in determining the effectiveness of government's policy reforms.Krishan Arora is Partner and Devika Dixit is Director, Grant Thornton Bharat LLP",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/what-budget-2024-can-do-to-get-foreign-investors-to-bet-on-india/articleshow/111898991.cms

Fiscal Deficit: The budgeted fiscal deficit, which is the difference between the government expenditure and income, for the current fiscal is 5.1 per cent as projected in the Interim Budget in February, against 5.8 per cent in the last fiscal year. The full Budget is expected to provide better-than-earlier projections as there has been tax buoyancy. The government has projected fiscal deficit at 4.5 per cent of the GDP in FY26.



Capital Expenditure: The government's planned capital expenditure for this fiscal year is budgeted at Rs 11.1 lakh crore, higher than Rs 9.5 lakh crore in the last fiscal year. The government has been pushing infrastructure creation and also incentivising states to step up capex.



Tax Revenue: The Interim Budget had pegged gross tax revenue at Rs 38.31 lakh crore for 2024-25, an 11.46 per cent growth over the last fiscal. This includes Rs 21.99 lakh crore estimated to come from direct taxes (personal income tax + corporate tax), and Rs 16.22 lakh crore from indirect taxes (customs + excise duty + GST).



GST: Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection in 2024-25 is estimated to rise to Rs 10.68 lakh crore, an increase of 11.6 per cent. The tax revenue figures will have to be watched out for in the final Budget for the 2024-25 fiscal year.



Borrowing: The government's gross borrowing Budget was Rs 14.13 lakh crore in the current financial year as per the Interim Budget. The government borrows from the market to fund its fiscal deficit. The borrowing number will be watched by the market, especially on the back of more-than-expected dividend from the RBI and financial institutions.



Nominal GDP: India's nominal GDP growth (real GDP plus inflation) in the current fiscal year is estimated to be 10.5 per cent to Rs 327.7 trillion as per the Interim Budget. In view of expected normal monsoon, improvement in revenue collections and pick up in rural consumption, is expected that there could be upward revision in growth estimate. Real GDP growth in current fiscal is projected at 7.2 per cent, as per the RBI.



Dividend: The interim Budget had projected Rs 1.02 lakh crore from RBI and financial institutions. This will be revised upwards as the RBI has already made surplus transfer of Rs 2.11 lakh crore earlier in May. At the same time, Rs 43,000 crore expected to be garnered from CPSEs.

Spotlight would also be on spending on key schemes, like NREGA, as well as key sectors like health and education.

Ahead of the budget 2024 , tech company executives have voiced their expectations, seeking a boost in India’s technology development ecosystem . According to Manoj Nair, head of global delivery centres at Fujitsu, India must take step to bolster digital literacy, emphasis on R&D and establish centres of excellence for innovation.“With close to 25% of the global workforce coming from India over the next decade, skill development and empowerment should be a strategic imperative.A skilled workforce is crucial for economic development. As technology rapidly advances, we need to prepare young people with a mix of education and skills to help meet the future needs of our economy,” Nair said.“Now is the time to bolster digital literacy by establishing dedicated centres of excellence. Looking ahead to Budget 2024, another area that calls for a greater emphasis is research and development (R&D) initiatives to enhance our competitiveness especially in AI. I remain optimistic that the government will introduce more ground-breaking and transformative initiatives, thus elevating AI use cases and intellectual property creation. By accelerating AI innovation, we can enhance the country’s technology development ecosystem and provide a major boost to sectors including healthcare and automotive among others,” he added.“In addition to AI, we must also elevate the country’s technology development ecosystem by strengthening the semiconductor space, which can provide a greater boost to sectors including healthcare and consumer electronics among others.

indiatimes.com,Towards Jan Samriddhi: How Union Budget 2024 can advance women-centric financial inclusion,"

Budget Expectations: During the G20 discussions last year, the world took note of the strides in financial inclusion made possible by the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) by ensuring women’s access to bank accounts through direct benefit transfers. Today, as of July 2024, over 290 million women are PMJDY bank account holders. In March this year, RBI’s Financial Inclusion Index rose to 64.2, up from 60.1 last year, reflecting increased access and usage. To sustain this growth, the Union Budget 2024 holds a fantastic opportunity to introduce bold and innovative measures focused towards expanding usage, and enhancing quality and choice of financial products for crores of Indian women.The current government is prioritizing women's economic empowerment, recognizing its multi-dimensional and integrated nature. Efforts are underway to expand the economic assets, participation, and influence of low-income women and their households by improving their access to financial services, knowledge, and markets. It is anticipated that the 2024 Union Budget will place a strong emphasis on 'Naari Shakti', particularly in terms of financial inclusion initiatives. This will be done by leveraging India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), through inter-ministerial convergence, with the focus on bringing women at the edge of finance into the formal and digital financial services’ fold.We can anticipate measure to catalyse industry-wide collaborations between public and private entities to bring in innovation at scale; creating a large cadre of women agents; investments towards building financial and digital capabilities; and ensuring gender-disaggregated data is used to make informed decisions.Central to this strategy is a network of women-centric financial agents (largely women) who will play a pivotal role in delivering accessible and personalised financial services to underserved regions. This transformative approach empowers women as ambassadors of digital and financial literacy, fostering trust and familiarity among traditionally underserved communities. Gender-sensitive training for such agents will help them deliver targeted customer education to women, particularly in promoting products vital to financial security, such as insurance. We may witness budgetary support, such as soft loans or seed capital, especially for women agents as they establish their banking businesses. Additionally, there could be reductions in GST rates for agents and investments in capacity building through financial training institutes.As an extension to this, we anticipate budgetary allocations towards achieving Insurance for all by 2047. To ensure universal, affordable, and adequate insurance coverage for all, we can anticipate a push towards creation of an alternate vehicle for rural micro-insurance, similar to the regional rural banks and public sector banks. This will attract differential costing and taxation to be profitable. For Bima Sugam to scale inclusively, we can anticipate benefits for the insure-tech industry for innovation, public-private partnerships to increase coverage. We could also see positive policies for recruitment and functioning of women Bima Vahaks.Given the immense focus on financial inclusion, innovations in DPI could enable a consolidated economic empowerment program uniting transformational and embedded financial services under a single umbrella. We can anticipate Jan Dhan, Jan Suraksha, affordable collateral-free credit, micro-insurance, digital payments, and other such products designed for women’s lifecycle needs converging into a program on improved financial health (it could be called Jan Samriddhi). This holistic convergence could be a game-changer as interministerial programs and missions come together.There is a growing push towards increasing women’s participation in the MSME segment, agriculture, and gig work while recognising that women are good borrowers. In India, women-owned businesses as a share of all MSMEs has grown by 50% in the past decade. Non-performing assets are lower for women-owned MSMEs, indicating women are better at repaying their loans. And yet the financing need of an estimated 70% of women-owned businesses' goes unmet. We may see a shift towards ensuring active accessibility of affordable, collateral-free loans for deserving women entrepreneurs, building upon initiatives led by SIDBI and select public sector banks. This proactive stance involves a multifaceted strategy wherein Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), LendTech, and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) will be encouraged to lower interest rates and will be able to avail credit guarantees. Nationwide collaborations between lenders, State Rural Livelihoods Missions, and established non-profit organizations are poised to support and amplify access to financial resources for the missing-middle and thin-file women entrepreneurs across underserved regions.As India emerges as a frontrunner in financial inclusion, it must lead by example for other Global South nations by championing innovative gender-sensitive economic policies. This can be achieved by the committing to an index that tracks women’s economic empowerment. It could also become part of RBI’s Financial Inclusion Index. This potential Index, grounded in the utilization of gender-disaggregated data collected from DPI systems, would mark a significant leap forward in using data to assess and address the unique challenges and opportunities faced by women as well as look at underserved and untapped customer segments. By aligning with global standards and acknowledging the importance of data-driven insights, such an Index could become a powerful instrument for policymakers, businesses, and stakeholders. It can help build a nuanced understanding of the economic landscape from a gender perspective, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.Finally, this year, the budget highlights the need for intensified efforts towards financial resilience from climate shocks, focusing on vulnerable groups and women. Low-income women face disproportionate impact from climate change but have fewer financial tools to manage their risks. To build climate resilience for such women, we may witness the announcement of gender-transformative financial products such as climate-linked microinsurance policies, weather-indexed savings accounts, green microloans, women-centred agricultural credit, renewable energy financing, community-based climate savings groups, disaster-linked cash transfers, and eco-friendly housing microfinance.The Union Budget 2024 presents a pivotal moment for India to strengthen its dedication to women-centric financial inclusion. By focusing on innovative measures that empower women to exercise economic agency, India can ensure that no woman is left behind on the journey towards Viksit Bharat.(The author is Regional Head - South Asia, Women’s World Banking)",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-towards-jan-samriddhi-how-union-budget-2024-can-advance-women-centric-financial-inclusion/articleshow/111885584.cms

Ahead of the budget, experts from the healthcare sector have emphasized the need for increased government spending, improved infrastructure, and enhanced innovation to build a robust healthcare system in India. Apart from that, the Indian healthcare industry holds greater expectations from the budget, right from affordability and accessibility to quality enhancements and more research and development.Expressing his views, Dr Girdhar Gyani, director general of Association of Healthcare Providers - India (AHPI), said, ""Increased government spending is necessary to address emerging health threats and achieve universal health coverage.""He said the government should prioritise a comprehensive approach to building a 'Healthy India,' focusing on sanitation, clean drinking water, and nutrition.""Public health institutes should be professionalised under autonomous state boards, and the Ayushman Bharat Yojana needs restructuring to include all SECC-2011 beneficiaries. Encouraging the private sector to establish tertiary care hospitals in tier-III towns and opening exclusive PG colleges will address infrastructure shortages. Additionally, promoting the indigenization of high-tech medical equipment and advancing the National Digital Health Mission is also crucial,"" he stated.Suneeta Reddy, managing director of Apollo Hospitals Group, said it is crucial to acknowledge the vital connection between our nation's economic health and its healthcare infrastructure as India approaches another Union Budget The pandemic exposed our healthcare system's vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for significant investments. To achieve the 5 trillion dollar economy goal, a robust healthcare sector must be central to our strategy, Reddy said.""Granting the healthcare sector 'national priority' status, similar to the IT sector in the 1990s, can spur this transformation. Boosting domestic manufacturing of medical devices through tax incentives and regulatory support will reduce dependency on imports, enhancing affordability and accessibility,"" she said.Probal Ghosal, chairman and director of Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, urged the government to increase healthcare spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP, focusing on rural areas.""Rationalizing the GST framework and prioritizing capacity building and training for healthcare professionals is vital. Enhancing healthcare infrastructure in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and encouraging private investment in medical colleges and healthcare facilities are essential.Encouraging private investment in medical colleges through land allotments, subsidies, and loan moratoriums, along with mandating doctor rotations and incentivizing specialists in smaller cities, will ensure equitable expertise distribution.Additionally, increasing budgetary allocations for primary care and expanding primary health centres (PHCs) through public-private partnerships (PPPs) is essential,"" Ghoshal said.IMA president Dr R V Asokan pointed out that the ""the allocation varying from 1.1 to 1.6 per cent GDP together by the various governments is one of the lowest in the world"".Moreover, the expenditure incurred on health determinants like drinking water, sanitation should be provided for separately.""Thus, the minimum allocation for health alone should be around 2.5 per cent of the GDP. Despite numerous policy pronouncements prioritizing health, the governments in India at the Centre and state levels have historically underfunded the public health sector, resulting in poor health outcomes and rising inequity in access to health care,"" he said.India's overall health spending (public and private) is currently estimated to be 3.8 per cent of its GDP, lower than the LMIC average of health spending share of GDP of around 5.2 per cent. India's health system is overwhelmingly financed by out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures incurred by households,"" he said.The IMA has also written a letter to the Union finance minister flagging its demands ahead of the budget.Dr Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, CEO and MD of Fortis Healthcare , echoed silimar demands of prioritizing healthcare infrastructure by increasing GDP spending to 2.5 per cent.""We urge the government to designate healthcare as a national priority and implement transformative measures to establish India as a global healthcare powerhouse.

The crypto community in India has high hopes from the Union Budget 2024-25 for several key changes that could significantly impact the industry. These proposals aim to create a more favorable environment for cryptocurrency trading and blockchain technology adoption. Here are the main points on the community's wishlist:One of the primary requests is to reduce the rate of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on the transfer of Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) under section 194S to 0.01%. Currently, the higher rate of TDS at 1% acts as a deterrent for investors, leading to reduced market liquidity and participation. A lower TDS rate would encourage more transactions and foster a healthier trading ecosystem. Additionally, it is suggested to revisit the threshold limit for tax deduction under Section 194S, increasing it from Rs 50,000 to Rs 5,00,000.The crypto community is advocating for the ability to set off and carry forward losses, similar to other sectors. Presently, losses incurred from trading VDAs cannot be carried forward to offset future gains from VDAs or any other income sources, which discourages long-term investment and strategic trading. Allowing this flexibility would align the crypto market with other financial markets, promoting a more stable and investor-friendly environment.Treating income from the transfer of VDAs at par with existing income sources is another significant demand. This means recognizing and taxing crypto income similarly to traditional forms of income, such as that from stocks or mutual funds. This change would not only simplify tax compliance for crypto investors but also legitimize cryptocurrency as a mainstream asset class. An amendment to Section 115BBH to reduce the tax rate from 30 percent to a rate comparable with assets in other industries would be a welcome change.In addition to the above-mentioned financial adjustments, there is a growing call for establishing a dedicated regulatory body to govern crypto transactions. Such an institution would ensure transparency, protect investors, and provide clear guidelines for compliance, thus fostering trust and stability in the market.While the industry welcomed the definition and inclusion of VDAs in the Income Tax Act, certain provisions, such as the high TDS rate and the lack of offset, have led many Indian VDA users to move to non-compliant foreign exchanges to trade. This puts them at risk of losing their investment and breaking the law, resulting in lesser tax revenues for the exchequer.The RBI's recent June 2024 Financial Stability Report (FSR) highlighted Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and its implications for financial stability. This mirrors global regulatory efforts to ensure a secure and stable environment for digital assets. As the Union Budget approaches, integrating these insights by establishing a robust regulatory framework under SEBI or RBI can help mitigate stability risks in the DeFi and digital asset space, ensuring that India remains competitive in this evolving global market.The crypto community remains hopeful that the Ministry of Finance will consider these proposals, leading to positive outcomes in the Union Budget 2024-25. Implementing these changes, particularly in reducing TDS and allowing the setoff and carry forward of losses, would encourage broader participation in the crypto market. A supportive regulatory environment is crucial for stimulating innovation, as it empowers the industry to transform existing businesses through the integration of blockchain technology.(The author is VP, WazirX): Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Prioritising tax reforms for a more business-friendly environment,"As the global economy evolves, countries must constantly reevaluate their economic policies to ensure competitiveness and sustainability. In this context, the budget for 2024 is an opportunity for our policymakers to prioritise tax reforms that will foster a more business-friendly environment. Implementing strategic changes to the tax system and procedures can stimulate economic growth, attract investment, and enhance the overall business climate in India.The way taxes are structured has a significant impact on how both businesses and individuals operate. Tax policies affect decisions about investments, business growth, job opportunities, and the overall performance of the economy. Because of this, the 2024 Budget needs to focus on making specific changes to the tax system that will encourage innovation, entrepreneurship, and long-term economic success.In the Budget 2024 , one of the critical areas that need attention is the corporate tax structure. Having a competitive corporate tax rate will encourage entrepreneurial investments, while making India a more central destination for multinational corporations and encouraging established enterprises to expand their operations. Lowering the corporate tax rate will incentivize businesses to invest in new ventures, research and development activities, and create employment opportunities.In addition to the corporate tax rate, the Budget for 2024 should consider introducing tax incentives and credits to promote investment in key industries such as technology, renewable energy, and infrastructure development. Targeted tax benefits for companies involved in these sectors will pave the way for sustainable growth in high-potential areas.Needless to say, the focus of tax reforms in the Budget 2024 should be on creating a business-friendly environment while also ensuring fiscal sustainability. While doing business has been greatly simplified since I started Unicel, my first company, in 2003, there is still some way to go.So, the biggest item on my Budget 2024 wishlist, though, is to simplify the tax compliance process for businesses. Complicated tax regulations and administrative procedures are a significant burden for companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. By simplifying the tax code and reducing compliance costs, we can ease the administrative burden on businesses, freeing up resources that can be deployed for more productive activities. A more efficient and transparent tax system will not only benefit businesses but also improve overall tax compliance and revenue collection. The tax reforms should be fair and balanced, with the aim of supporting business growth and job creation, stimulating investment, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the economy.I would also like to see measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which play a crucial role in driving broad-based economic growth and employment. Introducing tax relief programs such as tax credits for hiring new employees or investing in technology upgrades, can offer much-needed support to these businesses. By strengthening the resilience and competitiveness of SMEs, the government can contribute to a more diverse and dynamic business environment. This, in turn, can help boost economic growth and create more jobs, while also protecting local businesses from foreign competition.Another important aspect of tax reform in the Budget 2024 is related to international tax policies. With the growing globalisation of business operations, it is essential to review tax treaties and agreements to avoid double taxation and ensure fair treatment of cross-border transactions. By updating international tax rules and promoting cooperation with other countries, the government can enhance investor confidence and facilitate smoother cross-border trade and investment.Strategic tax reforms must be accompanied by responsible fiscal management to maintain overall economic stability. It's important to consult extensively with stakeholders, including businesses, industry associations, and tax experts, to gather diverse perspectives and insights for the design and implementation of effective tax policies. The government should strive to maintain fair and equitable tax policies while avoiding unintended consequences, and also ensure that the public is well-informed about the purpose and implications of the tax policies.As an individual, in light of the current high inflation rate and increasing GST base, I would also like to see the budget put money back into the hands of individuals, either through lowered rates or increasing the slabs. In my view, this would be a better approach than incentivising certain forms of investments, such as ELSS or PF or home loan repayments, to get tax breaks.In conclusion, the Budget 2024 is an important opportunity to prioritise tax reforms aimed at creating a better environment for businesses to succeed. By addressing key issues such as corporate tax rates, targeted incentives, simplifying tax compliance, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), modernizing international tax policies, policymakers can lay the groundwork for sustained economic growth, job creation, and enhanced competitiveness. The decisions made in the Budget 2024 can also be continued and tweaked over the next 4 budgets, enabling consistency and certainty. Therefore, the Budget 2024 must include a comprehensive set of tax reforms to ensure the long-term success of the economy.The writer is Founder and CEO of Hubler.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/policy-trends/budget-2024-prioritising-tax-reforms-for-a-more-business-friendly-environment/articleshow/111877642.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Reduction in GST rates for LED TVs larger than 32 inches expected,"Here’s what Avneet Singh Marwah said

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024-25 in Parliament on July 23. Ahead of the budget, Avneet Singh Marwah , CEO of Super Plastronics Pvt Ltd (SPPL), has sought a reduction in Goods and Services Tax (GST) for LED TVs larger than 32 inches.Marwah, who has played a pivotal role in SPPL's growth as a leading made-in-India consumer durable and appliances company, said that the reduction in GST will help strengthen its global economic standing.SPPL has essentially brought several renowned brands such as Kodak, Thomson, Blaupunkt, Westinghouse and White-Westinghouse, in the country.“The Union Budget of 2024 holds a critical role in ensuring India maintains its status as the world's third-largest economy.

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024 should allow professionals to switch between new and old tax regimes annually like individual taxpayers: Expert view,"Budget 2024 expectations: Professionals should also be given the option to switch tax regime every year

Budget 2024 expectations: Reduction in income tax rate for partnership firms and LLPs with small businesses

Budget 2024 expectations: Rationalisation of TDS rates for start-ups, small businesses

Budget 2024 expectations: To address issue of non-grant of full TDS credit appearing in Form 26AS

To boost small and medium businesses in India, the government should consider rationalising certain income-tax provisions for MSMEs and professionals in Budget 2024 Individual and HUF taxpayers have the option of choosing between the old and the new tax regime on an year-on-year basis. However, a person deriving income from business or profession who has opted out of the prevalent new tax regime u/s 115 BAC can exercise the option of returning to the new tax regime only once. This restriction on switching of the tax regime is a handicap for diligent and compliant professionals. It is expected that the Union Budget 2024 would provide flexibility for professionals to switch between the old and new tax regimes on an yearly basis.Professionals and small businesses are often incorporated as partnership firms or LLPs as compared to corporates due to ease of formation, low cost of operation, reduced compliance burden etc.. As per the present law, partnership firms and LLPs are taxed at flat 30% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) resulting in an effective tax rate of 34.94% in most cases. However, those businesses set up and operating as private limited companies are given the benefit of reduced effective tax rates such as 25.17% or 17.16%, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions.A significant percentage of small and medium businesses operate either as partnership firms or LLPs and pay tax at a much higher rate. Further, they do not have any option to pay tax at a concessional rate. Thus, in order to promote entrepreneurship and economic growth , there is a need to reduce tax rates for partnership firms and LLPs. Alternatively, introduction of a concessional regime for partnership firms and LLPs having turnover up to a certain limit can be considered in Budget 2024 so as to bring them at par with the corporates.Certain sections of the Income Tax Act provide a nominal TDS rate (for instance, Section 194C – applicable for contracts imposes a TDS rate @ 1%/2% depending upon the nature of tax deductee whereas section 194H- applicable for commissions imposes a TDS rate of 5%) whereas the TDS rates in certain other sections (Section 194J – applicable to professional services) is 10%.Subjecting small businesses and start-ups to withholding requirements restricts their liquidity which is a vital factor for smooth functioning of the business. Thus, it is expected that these TDS rates will be rationalized and reduced from 10% to 5% under section 194J.As per the existing income tax return (ITR) processing mechanism, small businesses and professionals are not granted full TDS credit appearing in Form 26AS in cases where the income offered in the ITR form (as per books) is lower than that reflecting in Form 26AS.It is important to note that the receipts as appearing in Form 26AS may be pertaining to income already offered to tax in preceding financial years or may be receipt of advance income and appearing in current year’s Form 26AS due to difference in method of accounting followed by the deductor and the taxpayer.The result is non-grant of TDS credit to the taxpayer either in the preceding financial year in which income has been offered (as TDS credit does not appear in Form 26AS for that financial year) or in the subsequent year in which it is appearing in Form 26AS (as the income as per books is lower than gross receipts appearing in Form 26AS), resulting in loss of TDS credit to the taxpayer.Therefore, in such cases, it is recommended that the government modifies the ITR processing mechanism procedure to allow TDS credit in the year in which it is appearing in Form 26AS even if gross receipts as per Form 26AS are higher than income as offered in the ITR.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/budget-2024-should-allow-professionals-to-switch-between-new-and-old-tax-regimes-annually-like-other-individual-tax-payers-expert-view/articleshow/111881404.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: India’s logistics sector eyes multimodal boost to combat Red Sea disruptions,"The logistics sector wants the government to use the budget to strengthen multimodal networks and inland waterways . This is crucial to combat the escalation in costs because of the Red Sea crisis, say industry stakeholders.K K Agarwal, Chairman and Managing Director of CJ Darcl Logistics Ltd, says severe disruptions in global supply chains have made shipping expenses hit an all-time high. The upcoming budget presents a crucial opportunity to mitigate this rise by introducing schemes related to multimodal connectivity and inland waterways. “Linking inland waterways to the Dedicated Freight Corridors project will enhance utilisation and create robust linkages. Measures like establishing port connectivity corridors, high traffic density corridors and commodity corridors can improve supply chain efficiencies and boost trade,” Agarwal says.The success of these plans is linked to the growth of the government’s Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) plan, coupled with enhanced funds allocation for ports, railways and road infrastructure, he states.The logistics sector has been grappling with escalating costs and disruptions caused by the tensions in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, two of the world’s most strategically important waterways. This has significantly disrupted marine traffic and global supply chains. The ongoing crisis, which started in November last year when Yemen’s Houthis started attacking cargo ships around the Red Sea area, has exposed the perils of over-reliance on traditional shipping routes. The development has compelled industry leaders to advocate for a robust multimodal network and the development of inland waterways.The logistics sector is hoping the budget to have a strong focus on multimodal networks and inland waterways, says Homyar Desai, Director of Sea Freight at Jeena & Company. “With the Red Sea crisis disrupting traditional shipping routes and increasing freight costs, leveraging our inland waterways can provide a reliable and economical solution for businesses,” Desai says.The industry needs innovative solutions to maintain efficiency and control expenses. “Developing inland waterways and strengthening multimodal connectivity will create a resilient supply chain that will be able to bear global shipping roadblocks. This approach would not only address immediate concerns but also strengthen India’s position in the global logistics landscape,” Desai adds.Jitendra Srivastava, CEO of Triton Logistics & Maritime Pvt Ltd, points out that integrating various transportation modes — rail, road, air and waterways — can streamline logistics operations, reduce congestion and optimise routes. “Government policies that support multimodal transport can encourage private sector investment and participation. Increasing the number of vessels boosts the capacity to handle and transport cargo, reducing the backlog of goods awaiting shipment or offloading. This also allows for more frequent shipments, resulting in more regular and predictable schedules, and quicker turnaround times for cargo at ports,” he adds.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-indias-logistics-sector-eyes-multimodal-boost-to-combat-red-sea-disruptions/articleshow/111858622.cms

“India's path to 'Viksit Bharat' hinges on nurturing technology breakthroughs through deep tech entrepreneurship. A Nasscom-Zinnov report shows that 14% of startup funding in the last five years has gone to deep-tech startups. It is crucial for the new government to establish a strong regulatory framework to support the startup ecosystem and ensure efficient fund allocation to encourage strategic R&D efforts. Some improvisation in the National Policy on Electronics (NPE) can boost manufacturing by strengthening local smart wearable production and enhancing India's global presence.

Guided by Aatmanirbhar Bharat, we additionally seek government support for extensively localizing component production, fostering a lucrative environment where homegrown brands can lead globally. Incentivizing domestic production through tax breaks, subsidies, and R&D funding will enhance India's manufacturing capabilities.

What Boult co-founder Varun Gupta expects from Union Budget 2024



As we look forward to the upcoming budget, I am filled with hope and anticipation. I believe that extending support for the (PLI) scheme is crucial for nurturing an entrepreneur-friendly ecosystem within the wearables segment.

We've seen remarkable success in the semiconductor sector, which inspires us to achieve similar milestones in our industry. Major tech firms are increasingly choosing to relocate their manufacturing to India, drawn by our nation's supportive policies. This shift has allowed us to reclaim nearly half of the market share previously held by global competitors. We at BOULT, aim to strengthen the entire electronics value chain and reduce our reliance on PCB and other components sourced from China.

Moreover, I am also excited about the potential influx of foreign capital, which we believe will catalyze significant growth within the startup sector. I am optimistic that with continued support, our industry can thrive, contributing to a vibrant and self-reliant economy. We look forward to collaborating with the government to make this vision a reality.”

On July 23, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will unveil the Union Budget 2024 in Parliament, an event eagerly anticipated by a diverse array of stakeholders. This budget is expected to address the aspirations and needs of common taxpayers, investors, various industries, farmers, women, and key sectors such as FMCG, real estate, and technology. Leaders in the hospitality sector, in particular, are watching closely, hopeful for policies that will promote sustainable tourism and drive economic growth.Amit Jaipuria , Founder and CEO of Postcard Travel Club , has shared his expectations from the upcoming budget, emphasizing the importance of making sustainable tourism a national priority. He stated, ""The government ’s intention to make sustainable tourism a national priority for revenue and employment in its third term is a great signal for the travel industry. Policy incentives for making tourism more sustainable should be put in place, and the use of storytelling to showcase regions and cultures should be further emphasized.""He highlighted the need for the government to consult with leading voices in sustainable tourism for infrastructure development that respects the environment and empowers local communities. ""The government should also consult with the leading voices in sustainable tourism such as the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, Transformational Travel Council, The Long Run, and Rare India for infrastructure development that respects the environment and empowers local communities,"" Amit Jaipuria added.One of the key measures Amit Jaipuria advocates for is providing tax relief and subsidies to properties following sustainable practices. He believes this will create a conducive environment for responsible properties to emerge in India, promoting inbound tourism.

indiatimes.com,Start 30% tax slab at Rs 30 lakh in Budget 2024 to give inflation-relief to middle class: Expert view,"Budget 2024: Rationalisation of tax slabs under new tax regime

Total Income (In Rs) Rate of Tax* Up to 3,00,000 0% 3,00,001 to 6,00,000 5% 6,00,001 to 9,00,000 10% 9,00,001 to 12,00,000 15% 12,00,001 to 15,00,000 20% Above Rs. 15,00,000 30%

Increase in Section 80C deduction limit and allowing it in new tax regime

Hike standard deduction limit in Union Budget 2024

Currently taxpayers have to choose between the old income tax regime, with its deductions and exemptions and the concessional tax regime, which offers lower tax rates but limits tax-saving options. While the concessional tax regime offers lower tax rates for most taxpayers, those earning above Rs 15 lakh face significant challenges.Currently, income above Rs 15 lakh attracts a tax rate of 30% under both regimes. This, coupled with the removal of most exemptions and deductions in the new regime, results in a higher effective tax burden for this segment of taxpayers. As such, there is a growing consensus among taxpayers in this bracket that the current tax rates do not adequately reflect the complexities and expenses associated with inflation and higher incomes.Also read: Poor middle class is getting taxed more: The gold standard demands 10% tax slab to start from Rs 10 lakh today Consequently, taxpayers have the following expectations from the coming budget 2024 on July 23, 2024.The Finance Act 2023 increased the basic exemption limit in the new tax regime from Rs. 2,50,000 to Rs 3,00,000 reducing the number of slabs to five from six, eliminating the tax rate of 25%. Accordingly, the existing tax structure under the concessional tax regime is as under:* Excluding surcharge and cessDue to imposition of surcharge and cess, the effective tax rate can be as high as 35.88% where taxable income exceeds Rs 2 crore and 39% where taxable income exceeds Rs 5 crore in new tax regime.The basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh in the new tax regime is still very low and there is a widespread expectation that the same would be increased to Rs 3.50 lakh.The tax rate of 30% for income exceeding Rs 15 lakh in this regime is very steep and should be made applicable only for income exceeding Rs 30 lakh. This will widen the tax slab of 20% ensuring that most personal taxpayers in the mid-income group get relief which would also propel higher consumption and savings.There is a case for eliminating the highest effective tax rate of 39% (due to surcharge and cess) as this is very steep and covers very few taxpayers. The same should be capped at 35.88% [{30% tax rate plus 15% surcharge thereon} plus 4% cess thereon]. This would create a more gradual progression in tax rates for higher incomes, thereby reducing the overall tax burden. A more progressive tax structure would incentivize greater compliance and economic participation.Section 80C of the IT Act is an umbrella section which provides a cumulative deduction limit of Rs 1.5 lakh for a basket of investment/expenditure-linked tax saving options. These options include payment of life insurance premium, investment in ELSS, PPF, , senior citizen saving scheme, 5-year fixed deposits, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana among others.. Section 80C benefit can also be claimed for expenditure for specified purposes such as children's tuition fees, principal repayment of home loan, etc.The Section 80C limit was last revised in Budget 2014. As such, individual taxpayers are seeking an upward revision of this limit as the existing threshold limit of Rs 1,50,000 is very low in view of the wide range of investment/expenditure options. Thus, to ensure parity of the 80C deduction limit with the annual inflation ranging between 4-5%, it is expected that this limit be increased to at least Rs 2,50,000. Such increase would benefit a majority of the taxpayers and has been long overdue.The Section 80C deduction has been a longstanding provision in the Indian tax system, aimed at promoting savings and channelling funds into specified avenues beneficial for the economy. Therefore, excluding this benefit from the concessional regime is not justified. Thus, extending this benefit to the default (concessional regime) would encourage taxpayers to continue these investments and also further encourage adoption of the new default concessional tax regime.Currently the limit for claiming standard deduction from salary is Rs 50,000 or the amount of salary (whichever is lower). This deduction is provided to cover expenses incurred during employment, excluding professional tax. It is pertinent to note that several expenses incurred by employees during the course of their jobs are not deductible under current provisions. Additionally, the exemptions available to the salaried u/s 10 are capped at outdated limits that fail to account for inflation, rendering them ineffective. Thus, in order to address this, it is expected that such standard deduction limit be increased to Rs 60,000 and should be adjusted annually in line with the Cost Inflation Index (CII). This would ease the tax burden on salaried individuals and maintain their purchasing power amidst inflationary pressures.(The author is Practising Chartered Accountant.)",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/start-30-tax-slab-at-rs-30-lakh-in-budget-2024-to-give-inflation-relief-to-middle-class-expert-view/articleshow/111853278.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024 expectations: Robust infrastructure framework can reduce overall logistics cost of transportation,"By Neetu Vinayek

Inland Cruise Shipping: Growth Opportunities and Policy Impetus

(The author is Partner (Infrastructure), EY India. Jasdeep Sahni, Director, EY India also contributed to the article. Views are personal)

Budget 2024 expectations for infrastructure: As India marches towards becoming an economic powerhouse, given the significant allocation of Rs 11.11 lakh crore (representing 3.4% of the GDP) in the interim budget for 2024, the infrastructure sector being a cornerstone of India's growth narrative, is expected to continue receiving considerable attention.While much of the attention was earlier focused on highways, a holistic approach to the infrastructure sector will not only facilitate efficient connectivity but also play a vital role in job creation and improving the standard of living. A robust infrastructure framework can also reduce the overall logistics cost of transportation, which is one of the key objectives of the National Logistics Policy, 2022. With the shipping sector being a major emitter, green shipping initiatives are gaining momentum as India seeks to align with global standards and contribute to the fight against climate change.The Indian government has launched the National Maritime Development Programme , which includes provisions for eco-friendly shipbuilding and recycling. Since vessels running on clean fuel require higher capex, the upcoming Budget should consider incentivising ship buyers to invest in green vessels, which would facilitate the maritime industry's shift towards more environmentally friendly operations.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Will FM Nirmala Sitharaman give income tax relief, bring changes in new tax regime? In addition, the Maritime Amrit Kaal vision underscores the government's commitment to establishing green hydrogen hub facilities at all Indian ports. By extending the sunset clause for production of sustainable fuels and manufacturing of hydrogen fuel cells, India can simultaneously attract investment in green shipping technologies and make strides towards its ambitious net-zero emissions target. Such policy measures would not only foster innovation in the maritime sector but also contribute to the global movement towards a sustainable and resilient shipping industry.The burgeoning inland cruise shipping sector also presents an opportunity for growth as there is a need to develop ports to accommodate large cruise vessels and build terminals with modern infrastructure to enhance passenger experience. While the Cruise Shipping Policy of 2008 aims to make India an attractive cruise tourism destination, significant funds are needed to develop infrastructural facilities at various ports of the country. Further, permitting companies to carry out ‘domestic cruising’ from the GIFT City and extending the benefit of 10 years’ tax holiday may encourage cruising companies to register their units in the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). This strategic move would stimulate the domestic cruising industry, leading to increased tourism revenue and broader economic benefits.The National Rail Plan is a step towards building a state-of-the-art railway system and increasing the share of freight traffic to 45% by 2030. In the 2024 interim Budget, the Finance Minister had announced implementation of economic corridor programmes aimed at fostering multi-modal connectivity, improving logistics efficiency and accelerating GDP growth. The upcoming Budget is expected to build on this momentum, with industry experts anticipating weighted tax deductions in connection with research & development activities. These tax deductions, if announced, would be in line with the Indian Railway Innovation Policy and are likely to stimulate investment in critical areas such as safety equipment, rail infrastructure enhancement, and the integration of cutting-edge technologies.Also Read | Union Budget 2024: What Modi government can do to promote sustainable & affordable living through green housing Another major segment of infrastructure development in India is aviation, which is currently experiencing a significant upswing, as demonstrated by the remarkable order of over 1,100 aircraft by Indian carriers within a mere 15-month period, all slated for delivery within the next five years. This surge in acquisitions underscores the rapid advancement of the industry. To sustain and amplify this growth, it is imperative that the government fortifies the necessary ecosystem and infrastructure. A key component to support this expansion is the development of comprehensive Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facilities within the country. Enhanced MRO capabilities will ensure minimal aircraft downtime, thereby optimizing operational efficiency. Considering these developments, the government should consider introducing fiscal incentives to encourage the establishment of state-of-the-art MRO services capable of accommodating large aircraft fleets in India.While the upcoming Budget is an opportunity for the government to reaffirm its commitment towards infrastructure development, the anticipation surrounding the Budget is palpable among various stakeholders, who are eager to see a continuation and expansion of supportive measures. In addition to incentive-based programmes like the PLI scheme and reduction in corporate tax rates, the Budget strategy must continue to focus on financial and regulatory incentives including substantial investments in infrastructure.With continued investment in infrastructure, policy reforms, digitalization, skill development, and green logistics, governments and businesses can further enhance the resilience and competitiveness of the sector. The above is a wish list of expectations which if accepted shall have the potential to significantly provide further impetus to the infrastructure sector. The right mix of financial allocations and policy reforms can help unlock the sector’s potential and drive the nation towards the vision of Viksit Bharat.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-expectations-robust-infrastructure-framework-can-reduce-overall-logistics-cost-of-transportation/articleshow/111861255.cms
indiatimes.com,"Union Budget 2024: Incentives for sectors, customs reforms expected","By Bipin Sapra and Smritikona Dutta, Tax Partner, EY India

(The authors, Bipin Sapra and Smritikona Dutta, are Tax Partners at EY India)

Budget 2024 expectations : The inaugural Budget by the new NDA administration led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to continue the focus on manufacturing and self-reliance that were outlined in the Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat programmes, while also ensuring that climate goals are not short changed and emission reduction targets are met.India will almost certainly become the third-largest economy before the end of this decade and Prime Minister Modi has set the goal for India to join the ranks of developed nations by 2047. In addition to incentivising investments and implementing PLI schemes to drive ‘local value addition’ in the manufacturing ecosystem across supply chains, a comprehensive revamp of import tariffs will have a deep impact on India’s manufacturing capabilities and overall competitiveness.Also See: Income Tax Slab 2024-25 Following the success of PLI schemes, there is a need to introduce sectoral incentives on a continuous basis. We may see the government move away from the traditional PLIs and bring in incentives for specific sectors where domestic production and value addition are imperative to make them a part of global value chains. We may also see other types of incentives – such as design based incentives linked to R&D and design in the country. StreamliningCustoms duties and tariffs will also go a long way in supporting manufacturing. Given the multiple exemptions and effective tariff rates of various goods, coupled with the various Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), the structure of Customs duty has got distorted, with an increasing number of cases of inverted duty structures. Similarly, rationalising import tariffs on specific inputs will also support ‘Make in India’ in different sectors.A strategic roadmap is needed to shift duty slabs to competitive levels such as maintaining low or nil duty on raw materials, lower slabs for intermediates, and standard slabs for final products. Additionally, the current tariff framework requires importers to navigate both the Customs tariff and numerous exemption notifications for duty rates – and these need to be rationalised and harmonised so that importers do not have to spend excess time in availing these benefits. These steps would be in line with what has been a key agenda for the government – pruning the list of existing Customs exemption notifications and simplifying the tax structure.Ease of doing business has always been of high priority for the government and, though strictly not a part of the Budget exercise, along with the tax rationalisation in imports can have a significant impact on the manufacturing sector. Two other issues – again not strictly a part of the Union Budget – can help significantly boost the manufacturing sector and Finance Minister can look at them as well. The first is an announcement about a policy or proposal to reduce the large number of pending litigation cases pertaining to Customs and allied Acts. An amnesty scheme or any other step to settle many of the ongoing disputes will reduce the backlog of cases and improve the overall ease of doing business in the country. Reducing pending litigations in other corporate tax disputes will also have a big impact.Also Read | Union Budget 2024: What Modi government can do to promote sustainable & affordable living through green housing It would be useful to devise a roadmap of different measures that improve doing business. Among other steps, it could include digitization and auto-renewal of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status, which is an international mark of quality and compliant Customs. Time-bound completion of Special Valuation Branch processes (for related party imports) and online modules for Bill of Entry amendments, which includes procedural errors when goods are first imported, could also be included. Similarly, issues arising on account of determining rules of origin of goods to ascertain the right Customs duty can be resolved to avoid unnecessary delays at the ports/ airports.Similarly, while GST is not part of Union Budget, the Union Finance Minister has a significant voice in the GST Council. Therefore, it makes sense to mention GST here. The proposed introduction of Section 65A to the Customs Act, 1962, which mandates IGST payment on goods imported into MOOWR units including special warehouse units (in-bond manufacturing in warehouses, under Manufacturing and Other Operations in Warehouse Regulations) would impact the working capital of taxpayers thus reducing the scheme’s viability.The Finance Minister can also propose GST-related changes in the Budget speech, though most decisions regarding GST are announced post the GST Council meetings. The 53rd GST Council meeting has brought in a new Section to give benefits to as-is-where-is practices in the industry. Section 11A empowers the government to regularize non/short levies due to industry practices. A similar Section existed in the Central Excise and Service Tax laws but was not introduced in the GST Acts. Accordingly, given the new law with its own complexities, the GST Council has been promising as-is-where-is basis benefits to industry in a number of cases. However, those decisions lack legal backing. If the Parliament and state governments pass the amendment, Section 11A will empower the Council to debate and consciously allow such benefits in the law.Also Read | Budget 2024 expectations: Power sector decarbonisation hinges on renewables Another significant amendment is expected in Section 16(4) of the CGST Act to extend the time limits for claiming input tax credit for the initial years of GST implementation, providing substantial relief to taxpayers.Boosting manufacturing is an imperative for India, and so is meeting climate goals. India has set ambitious targets for reducing carbon footprint and finance and taxation also play a major role in meeting these targets. With EU introducing the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), it is time India looks at its internal explicit carbon pricing mechanisms to counter the impact of tariff barriers which may get created by other countries to prevent leakage while pricing carbon. The industry is looking forward to measures that bring in explicit carbon pricing mechanisms or initiate the debate on taxing carbon footprint to allow India’s exports to remain competitive.The government has always supported the Indian industry in the past and is confident that this government will table a cogent and enabling Budget in the Parliament, laying down policy imperatives as well as a blueprint for the future.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2024-incentives-for-sectors-customs-reforms-expected/articleshow/111860322.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Need to strengthen India’s supply chain through digital technologies,"India strides to become a global manufacturing hub providing resilient supply chain options for leading manufacturers across industry sectors. Technology enablement is critical to enable efficient and reliable supply chain operations and it is imperative for the government of India to strengthen nation’s digital backbone. The G20 summit in 2023 raised significant concerns on the efficacy of global supply chains that break down during critical times and the need for immediate solutions including supply chain de-risking and diversification. The government of India emphasised India's crucial role in creating a reliable and efficient global supply chain and called on businesses to collaborate with India. In line with this, the upcoming union budget 2024 presents an opportunity to address existing challenges and position India as the reliable supply chain node for the world.Technology is revolutionising India's manufacturing sector, with a key focus on improving supply chain logistics. The surge in e-commerce and the need for efficient supply chains are pushing logistics companies to adopt advanced technologies. India’s ambition of increasing its participation in global value chains (GVC) from the current level of ~40% to ~50% will require building manufacturing competency and supply chain efficiency. Considering these challenges, the upcoming budget need to enable investments in digital infrastructure, scaling of e-commerce, and adaption of smart logistics to strengthen supply chains in key focus areas:The biggest impetus should be given to creating an improved ecosystem for the digital supply chains of the future. Promoting investment in robust digital infrastructure, including high-speed internet connectivity, data centres and cloud computing facilities will elevate the infrastructure critical for supply chain operations and its sustainability. These investments will also enable IT sector and Global Capability Centres (GCC) in India . The Indian data center market is estimated to reach 2 GW in 2024 and projected to reach ~5GW by 2030 growing at a CAGR of ~18%. Impetus to data center sector is critical to drive digital supply chain enablement and expansion of digital economy. In addition, investment towards expanding broadband access across the country is critical to ensure nationwide digital connectivity.Measures to support the development and scaling of e-commerce platforms to facilitate seamless online transactions and better integration with suppliers and customers is necessary enhance the reach and reliability of the supply chain. Currently valued at approximately $70 billion, India's e-commerce platforms make up approximately 7% of the country's total retail market, presenting a huge opportunity for growth. With a staggering ~58% internet penetration, India boasts the world's second-largest internet user base, positioning itself to emerge as the third-largest online retail market by 2030. Integration of critical value chain players including MSMEs into e-commerce platforms such as ONDC and adoption of digital technologies is critical for the realisation of the online market potential. Targeted interventions would be necessary to expedite value chain integration and digital adoption.Encourage the adoption of smart logistics solutions and automation technologies in warehouses, distribution centres, and transportation networks. These technologies can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and minimise errors in the supply chain. The Indian freight and logistics market is estimated to grow at ~9% annually to $480 billion by 2029 from the current base of $315 billion, with technological advancements being a major enabler. The integration of cutting-edge technologies and advancements in intralogistics, automation, warehousing, and transportation management heralds a transformative era for the logistics sector in India. Leveraging robotics, automation, AI, and other cutting-edge solutions, logistics companies can streamline processes, reduce costs, and stay ahead of the competition from other major economies. Incentivising this sector for the adoption of digital technologies to improve transparency and predictability will help India reduce the loss of GDP due to logistics inefficiency, currently estimated to be at ~13%.In the upcoming budget, it is expected that the central government would focus on policy push to strengthen India's supply chain prowess through the adoption of digital technologies. With investments in technology adoption and enabling right policies for digital ecosystem, India can create a robust digital ecosystem that supports efficient and resilient supply chains, driving economic growth and competitiveness.The writer is Partner, Consulting at Deloitte India.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-need-to-strengthen-indias-supply-chain-through-digital-technologies/articleshow/111852700.cms

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: R&D boost, Indian shipping line will give an impetus to exports, says industry","Research and development and innovation are key to sustain exports in the long run and so the government should announce measures in this regard in the budget, says Ashwani Kumar, President, Federation of Indian Export Organisations ( FIEO ).“R&D is incentivised across the world. As many as 35 out of 38 OECD countries provide either lower tax or higher deduction on R&D expenditure. The weighted tax deduction under Section 35(2AB) may be increased to 250-300% and the benefit under Section 35(2AB) should also be extended to limited liability partnerships, partnership firms and proprietary firms, as MSME units largely fall in these categories,” he says.With India’s target of achieving $1 trillion in exports by 2030, making conducive policies that encourage exports is important, say experts.Exports contribute approximately 23% to India’s GDP, up from 19% in 2020, according to a DHL report. In FY24, India registered exports of $778 billion. While services exports increased from $325.3 billion to $341.1 billion, merchandise exports saw a dip from $451.1 billion to $437.1 billion.Listing out the request of exporters on what the budget should focus on, Kumar says there is a need to set up an Indian shipping line and make it an entity that is globally competitive. This can help to reduce the arm-twisting practices of foreign shipping lines, which will be particularly helpful for MSMEs . “India’s outward remittance on transport services is increasing with rising exports. We remitted over $109 billion as transport service charge in 2022. As the country moves towards the goal of $1 trillion, this will touch $200 billion by 2030. A 25% share by an Indian shipping line can save us $50 billion on a year-on-year basis.”On the marketing support provided through the market access initiative (MAI), he says the corpus of Rs 200 crore is inadequate. More support can accelerate the country’s exports growth. “We request that a recurring budget of Rs 500 crore annually be provided to the Department of Commerce so that our products and services are showcased at global platforms,” he says.Other industry experts point out that interest subvention for the manufacturing sector is key to make India compete in the world market. Puran Dawar , President, Agra Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Chamber (AFMEC), says that investment allowance, instead of cash subsidies, will help to boost investment in industry. “Investment allowance for select make-in-India labour-oriented industries for a minimum period of five years will grow the industry multifold. Profits will be invested in industry and will not migrate to real estate. After 5 years, the government will get more taxes,” he states.For the footwear and leather industry, Dawar says all raw materials for value addition should be put under a zero-duty structure for five years. “Within these five years, such industries should be promoted in India. This will give a boost to footwear exports,” he adds.Susanne Pulverer, CEO and CSO, IKEA India, expects the budget to step up with schemes on the “Make in India” initiative to help cater to both domestic and export markets; provisions that promote sustainable practices, including incentives for eco-friendly materials; and green manufacturing.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/trade/exports/insights/budget-2024-rd-boost-indian-shipping-line-will-give-an-impetus-to-exports-says-industry/articleshow/111852419.cms

: The Modi government, in its first Budget of the third term, is expected to stick to the disinvestment target set for this fiscal year in the interim Budget. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman set the target for 2024-25 at Rs 50,000 crore. However, in the Interim Budget tabled in February, the 2023-24 disinvestment estimate was revised downward to Rs 30,000 crore from the previously budgeted Rs 51,000 crore.Ahead of the full Budget for 2024-25, scheduled for July 23, SBI Research has suggested that the government may take a clear stance on the disinvestment of public sector banks (PSBs). The report, led by Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser at SBI, emphasised the need for a concrete roadmap to attract capital and boost confidence in financial institutions.A recent CareEdge Ratings report noted a total disinvestment potential of approximately Rs 11.5 trillion at current market capitalization, assuming the government retains at least a 51 per cent stake in these public enterprises. Public sector enterprises could contribute around Rs 5 trillion, while public sector banks and insurance firms could potentially add another Rs 6.5 trillion.The government's disinvestment proceeds totalled Rs 16,507 crore and asset monetisation fetched around Rs 16,000 crore, beating the combined revised target of Rs 30,000 crore for FY24.Dividend collections from the central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and other entities also rose to a fresh peak of Rs 63,749 crore in FY24, according to the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) data. The FY24 dividend revenue was about 27.5 per cent higher than the revised estimate of Rs 50,000 crore, suggesting strong performance by state-run firms across sectors.As for this fiscal, the government has raked in Rs 4,918 crore in such dividends so far. It now expects to conclude the privatisation of IDBI Bank and divest stake in Shipping Corporation of India and NMDC Steel, among others, in FY25. This will help it boost its divestment revenue.In a report, analysts at CareEdge Ratings said: ""With a bumper dividend from the RBI (Rs 2.11 lakh crore), the central government's fiscal position remains comfortable, which may limit the urgency to push hard on divestments"". As such, the combined divestment and asset monetisation target accounts for just 1.6 per cent of the government's budgeted non-debt receipts for FY25. It signals the government's diminishing reliance on such revenue to finance its fiscal deficit.The CareEdge analysts have, however, estimated a huge disinvestment potential of about Rs 11.5 lakh crore at current market capitalisation, assuming the government maintains at least a 51 per cent stake in public firms and offloads excess shares.DIPAM secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey had earlier told ET that setting a high annual disinvestment target would potentially create an ""overhang in the market"" and could be detrimental to the value creation strategy of the CPSEs concerned. So, the government would follow a ""calibrated disinvestment strategy"", he said.The Modi government, which returned to power for a third term, but failed to get a majority on its own, has to rely on allies to push through with their plans. These allies in turn are likely to flex their political muscle and wrest their pound of flesh from the Centre.Nonetheless, the signals emanating from the Modi government are clear that coalition pressures won’t influence key policy decisions and there will be a continuity as India treads on the path of ‘Viksit Bharat’.Strategic sale is a key policy decision and is unlikely to be put on the back burner. The government has been slow in selling stake in IDBI Bank and had shelved plans for BPCL . Experts believe that the IDBI Bank stake sale is likely to be completed in the current fiscal. It won’t bail out on its promise to limit itself to a few strategically important sectors and exit from the rest.The SBI Research report expects the government to clarify the possible stake sale by LIC and the Centre in IDBI Bank during the upcoming Budget.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given its 'fit and proper' approval to bidders for IDBI Bank, according to a Times of India report. This approval comes ahead of the Budget, marking a significant step in the government's plan to divest its stake in the bank.The Modi government initiated the divestment process in May 2021, awaiting the RBI's assessment of the bidders' compliance with regulations. The central bank has reviewed all but one bidder, a foreign participant that did not provide necessary information and whose regulator has not shared data.With IDBI Bank's market cap nearing Rs 95,000 crore, the government could potentially realize around Rs 29,000 crore from this disinvestment. However, some observers believe the transaction terms are not very attractive.The government and Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) collectively own 94.72 per cent of IDBI Bank, with LIC holding 49.24 per cent and the government 45.48 per cent. Public shareholders hold the remaining 5.28 per cent. The Centre plans to sell a 60.7 per cent stake, comprising 30.5 per cent of its own and 30.2 per cent of LIC's.Market observers see IDBI Bank as a straightforward divestment candidate since it operates as a private lender, with government stake increasing due to capital infusions to manage bad debt losses.Given recent disappointments in the divestment sphere, the Modi government might reconsider its privatization agenda, according to a Reuters report. Instead, the focus could shift to overhauling state-run firms. In a recent interim budget, the government did not disclose figures on stake sales for the first time in over a decade.The 2021 announcement to privatize most state-run companies included two banks, one insurance company, and firms in the steel, energy, and pharmaceutical sectors. However, only the sale of Air India to the Tata Group has been completed, with some plans reversed and only a 3.5 per cent stake in LIC sold.Disinvestment typically refers to the partial or complete sale of government-owned enterprises. The new Public Sector Enterprises (PSE) policy notified in 2021 aims at minimising the presence of government in all sectors of the economy.Minority stake sale happens through traditional routes like IPOs and FPOs while strategic sale refers to making a clean exit with transfer of management control. Privatisation refers to selling of entire government equity along with transfer of management control to a private strategic buyer.In her Budget for 2021-22, Sitharaman had announced the government’s plans to privatise two state-run banks and one insurance company while presenting the. The agenda is likely to gather steam in FY25.The SBI report highlighted the ongoing reforms and policy support transforming PSBs. It suggested reducing government ownership in these banks, granting greater HR autonomy, investing further in digital and IT infrastructure, and aligning the priority sector lending (PSL) framework with current priorities. Collaboration with global peers should also be scaled up, the report said.“The best course of action is to privatise all the PSBs, other than SBI and at best one more PSB. Consolidation is an intermediate solution. The 11 PSBs, other than SBI, can be consolidated in 3-4 banks, before they are privatised,” said former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg.Speaking on the issue of consolidation in the banking space, Vivek Iyer, partner, Grant Thornton Bharat, said, “There is still room for consolidation with the public sector banks to bring about greater efficiencies. This will also help us create large banks from an India standpoint, that can look at playing a larger role at a global level. We cannot build global supranational banks from India without consolidation.“Garg feels that the slow privatisation process of banks is due to the loss of conviction on part of PM Modi and the BJP. He doesn’t think that the allies have any anti-privatisation stand.The disinvestments of state-run Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) and NMDC Steel are also expected to gather traction now that the general election is over, ET bureau had earlier reported.Sources close to the development told ET in May that the government is in the process of finalising the composition of the board of Shipping Corporation of India Land and Assets Ltd (SCILAL), created by hiving off the non-core real estate assets of SCI, to comply with regulatory requirements for the entity's listing.The Centre will invite financial bids for its entire 63.75 per cent stake in SCI soon after the demerged entity, SCILAL, is listed. While SCILAL will remain with the government, SCI, with its core assets, will be privatised.Privatisation of other smaller PSUs is likely to follow.Despite the Modi government's ambitious privatisation agenda, targeting public sector companies such as BPCL, CONCOR, BEML, Shipping Corporation, IDBI Bank, state-run lenders, and an insurance company, there has been very limited progress. The privatization efforts have been virtually frozen for the last 18 months due to the upcoming general elections.The Modi government's stance on privatisation is eagerly anticipated, especially as it now depends on coalition partners. The upcoming Union Budget is expected to provide key insights.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-disinvestment-bank-privatisation-will-it-be-curtains-for-strategic-sale-of-public-assets-under-modi-3-0/articleshow/111855412.cms

Budget 2024 expectations for housing: As the world increasingly focuses on environmental conservation and sustainable development, India's budget 2024 is expected to make a strong commitment to promote innovative green housing . With the rapid expansion of cities and loss of green spaces, there is a growing awareness of environmental concerns.In the upcoming 2024 budget, the government is expected to introduce a range of incentives aimed at promoting affordable and sustainable living . These measures will encourage the adoption of eco-friendly technologies within the real estate sector, making green homes and buildings more accessible to a wider population.Budget 2024 is expected to focus on providing financial incentives and subsidies to promote the development and purchase of environment-friendly homes and buildings.This may include offering tax deductions for homeowners who invest in green homes – whether they are building from scratch or investing in energy-efficient upgrades in an existing property. Additionally, grants may be provided for builders and developers who use sustainable materials, and low-interest loans may be offered for green housing projects. These monetary incentives help to offset higher upfront costs associated with green building technologies, making sustainable housing more affordable for consumers.To enhance the efficiency of financing for environment-friendly housing , the budget is expected to expand the existing green home loan programs. This may involve reducing interest rates and extending repayment terms, aiming to incentivize people to opt for eco-friendly housing options. By broadening the scope and reach of these loans, the government hopes to reduce financial barriers and encourage the adoption of green housing.It goes without saying that builders and developers have a substantial role to play in the construction of green housing projects. Budget 2024 is likely to introduce incentives specifically tailored to encourage their involvement in such projects. Possible measures could include tax credits for appropriate use of renewable energy sources, discounts or rebates for integrating sustainable building practices, as well as fast-track approval of green building projects.This year, the budget aims to boost regulatory framework in order to support the development of green housing. This could include implementing stricter energy efficiency standards for new green building projects, allowing the use of sustainable materials and enforcing regulations that promote environmental conservation. By establishing a robust regulatory framework the government can aim towards green housing becoming a standard practice rather than an exception.Also Check | Union Budget 2024: Reintroduce tax holiday for affordable housing with a tweak In response to an ever-increasing awareness for environmental conservation, organisations across sectors have been actively working towards promoting sustainability. One such initiative is the introduction and promotion of green home loans . In order to boost green housing projects, financial institutions and banks have introduced green home loans into their product category.Green home loans are individually designed financing options aimed at promoting the construction of green buildings – whether commercial or residential purposes. These loans usually offer favourable terms such as lower interest rates and longer repayment periods to incentivize eco-friendly practices. Such loans support investments in energy-efficient appliances, renewable energy systems, solar panels and sustainable construction materials. By doing so, they contribute to helping reduce environmental impact and nurturing green living.Green home loans set themselves apart from traditional home loans by offering privileged terms and conditions that encourage eco-friendly upgrades and constructions. Buyers can avail a host of benefits including extended repayment tenure to subsidised interest rates. They prioritise investments in energy-efficient buildings and renewable products that are targeted at promoting reduced environmental impact.When it comes to buyers, they can benefit a lot from green residential spaces. These include substantially reduced utility costs, improved indoor air quality leading to a healthier lifestyle and enhanced comfort. Additionally, they promote long-term financial savings for homeowners.Support for green housing in India has been gaining momentum in recent years with both government and private players prioritising sustainability. This growing trend echoes a strong commitment towards reducing environmental impact, nurturing sustainable development and at the same time ensuring a healthier living environment for our future generations.Discussions regarding the impact of climate change have been intensifying globally for quite some time now.Undoubtedly, in light of the current era where climate change is an undeniable reality, embracing green homes and buildings can serve as a liberating force and contribute to larger causes such as sustainability and energy conservation, ultimately leading to the creation of more resilient communities.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2024-what-modi-government-can-do-to-promote-sustainable-affordable-living-through-green-housing/articleshow/111858874.cms

Anil Bansal, Senior Director – Urban Infrastructure & Tourism, IPE Global lists his Budget 2024 expectations for infrastructure:

In the interim budget in February, it was announced that the outlay for infrastructure has reached 3.4% of GDP at Rs 11.11 lakh crore, topping the previous high of Rs 10 lakh crore during fiscal 2023-24. With the elections behind us and the continuation of the NDA government for its third term, it is now certain that this thrust on infrastructure will continue over the next 5 years, with special emphasis on sustainable cities and sustainable tourism.

We expect substantial budgetary commitments to the urban sector in line with pre-election announcements.

Major allocations to the housing sub-sector shall continue, considering the proposed expansion of the PMAY mission and slum re-developments.

The mobility sub-sector will also receive major outlays. Apart from metro rail and multi-modal transport facility projects, the re-development of several railway stations and provision of e-buses in major cities will require increased financing.

Allocation to the urban water sub-sector is not expected to increase by much. Major initiatives such as AMRUT 2.0, SBM 2.0, NMCG have been progressing steadily over the last few years, and annual fund requirements of states and UTs are already known. As of now, there are no major programmes in pipeline that could necessitate additional budgets.

Apart from this, we expect to witness renewed focus on waste management, especially on managing open dumpsites and landfills, bio-mining, bio-methanation, etc. under the waste-to-wealth mission, all of which ideally requires higher capital commitments.

There was major increase in the tourism sector allocation in the Interim Budget, mainly due to the Swadesh Darshan (SD 2.0) and PRASHAD schemes. We expect similar allocations to reflect in the full budget, since the projects under SD 2.0 are moving towards the implementation stage this year.

With cities being recognized as engines of growth, it is imperative to transform how urban local bodies and other institutional stakeholders function. This is essential to improve management of infrastructure and improve coverage and quality of urban services. In this context, we would like this budget to finally focus also on a comprehensive set of urban reforms. which have been pending for decades, and which are critical for moving towards sustainable urban rejuvenation.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-expectations-live-updates-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-23-july-income-tax-slab/liveblog/111850259.cms

, Chief Economist & Head-Research,, says there is no urgency on the part of the government or the finance ministry to cut down their projected fiscal deficit or the borrowing number at this moment, possibly they can afford to take a call on that at a later date. But in general, with the additional resources, they will start to allocate it in some ratio both for consumption and investment and not focus too much on cutting the fiscal deficit right away.Every Budget needs to deal with so many expectations that by definition it is almost always a tightrope walk. But having said that, I tend to say that the broad performance of the economy is relatively good. Growth is improving, interestingly from the rural side where there was a lot of concern at some point in time, it looks like some of the indicators have started gradually improving.Globally, the concerns around inflation are coming back a bit, but still, in the case of India, it is relatively better managed. The fiscal deficit has steadily come down throughout the last few years, also with the additional buffer that we have seen in the last few months, especially in the form of a decent tax collection or more so from the RBI surplus transfer, I think there is a bit of cushion in the hands of Honourable FM.Now, what will be very interesting to see is whether the particular additional resources that the government or FM enjoys at this moment, will be directed more towards immediate consumption boosting which will give some kind of an immediate boost to growth or they continue with some kind of support to their investment driven programmes. I think at this moment they can choose to go for a mix of both and they have the resources for that, that is the good news.So, I tend to believe that the broad nature of overall improvement in the quality of fiscal spending that we have witnessed throughout the last few years will continue. We are seeing a much higher share of capex in the fiscal maths in the last few years and my sense is that that continues. There is no urgency on the part of the government or the finance ministry to cut down their projected fiscal deficit or the borrowing number at this moment, possibly they can afford to take a call on that at a later date. But in general, with the additional resources, they will start to allocate it in some ratio both for consumption and investment and not focus too much on cutting the fiscal deficit right away.I try to answer it in two parts. One part is in terms of boosting consumption and the other part is tax sops. I am much more confident and hopeful about the first part. The second part we need to figure out. In terms of the first part, I think that the focus is very…, given that the government has done a lot in terms of large ticket capital projects, I sense that there might be a renewed focus on a lot of small ticket items at this moment which touches millions of lives, make a difference at the grassroots level, make a bigger difference in case of the rural economy and provide a little bit of additional support given that that part of the economy has started turning around, it will be very very helpful if we can provide that additional support.I sense that they will try to figure out how exactly they can provide that additional support. Not necessarily in the form of subsidies, I do not think that is the preferred route or there may not be much of a need for that, but some catalyst kind of initiatives, spending, etc, which can crowd in a little bit of additional private sector activity. The same is true in the case of a broader investment spectrum also the last few years we have seen a lot of focus on the part of the government to spend on investment projects, I sense that now they will be focusing a little more if there is any more low-hanging fruit left in terms of spending a little amount of money and spur a little bit of private capex because that is the part in the economy which is lagging and it has been a bit lagging for the last at least four-five years if not longer.So, gradually, there will be a slightly more focus on that. That is my expectation in terms of their spending mix. In terms of the tax sops, it will be a pleasant surprise if we see something meaningful. But a little bit of support here and there is expected given that they want to move the needle to support consumption a little more.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/fm-can-afford-to-go-for-a-mix-of-consumption-boost-capex-in-this-budget-siddhartha-sanyal/articleshow/111803436.cms

With the Union Budget 2024 around the corner, India’s electric vehicle (EV) industry is bracing for crucial policy announcements. The sector, which has witnessed significant growth in recent years, is now at a juncture where industry leaders believe that the support from the central government will help in maintaining the growth momentum.That said, the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME) India scheme, which has been instrumental in driving EV adoption, concluded on March 31, 2024.While the scheme has provided a much-needed support, challenges such as limited charging infrastructure and high battery costs persist. Later, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) launched the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) to enhance the adoption of two-wheeler and three-wheeler electric vehicles and support EV development and manufacturing in India.The EMPS-2024, with a budget of Rs. 500 crore, is set to expire on July 31, 2024. It offers subsidies of up to Rs 10,000 for two-wheeler EVs, up to Rs 25,000 for small three-wheeler EVs, and up to Rs 50,000 for large three-wheeler EVs. Now, with the Union Budget set to be presented in the parliament on July 23, 2024, let’s take a look at what the budget expectations from the EV industry looks like.Chetan Maini, Co-founder and Chairman of SUN Mobility, highlighted the need for comprehensive support in the upcoming Budget to bolster India's EV ecosystem. He said, “India is paving the way for the EV evolution, with the government taking constructive steps toward clean mobility and adhering to its net-zero emission goals. In the upcoming Budget, the industry seeks a level playing field for all technologies, emphasizing the need to address disparities in GST and subsidies, particularly for swappable batteries,”“Anticipated measures include a comprehensive Battery Swapping Policy, the launch of FAME III, with an increased allocation for e-buses, and proposals to incentivize local production of EV components, all aimed at fortifying India’s EV ecosystem,” he added.Madhumita Agrawal, Founder and CEO of Oben Electric, sees the Budget as a pivotal moment for the EV sector 's growth. She added, “Currently, manufacturers face a significant cash flow squeeze due to the higher GST rates on raw materials (18-28%) compared to the lower GST rate on the final vehicle (5%). We hope the budget will address this disparity to reduce the burden on manufacturers, eventually transferring the cost benefit to the consumer.”Akash Gupta, Co-founder and CEO of Zypp Electric, believes policy continuity is crucial for achieving net-zero carbon emissions. He asserts, “Inclusion in the priority lending scheme and reducing GST for EV services from 18% to 5% will accelerate EV-led delivery adoption. Recognizing last-mile delivery as a distinct sector under logistics policies is essential,”“Establishing industry standards, supporting gig delivery partners with tailored schemes, and implementing standard operating procedures (SOPs) will enhance efficiency and foster growth in this vital but often overlooked segment of the logistics industry. An extension of the existing EMPS scheme will result in better stakeholder sentiment and investor confidence.” he concluded.Niraj Rajmohan, CTO and Co-Founder of Ultraviolette, advocates for robust support in deep tech R&D and innovation. He notes, “The next phase of the sector’s growth will be strongly hinged on our ability to evolve into an independent technology creator. We advocate for initiatives and subsidy structures without segment caps which will in turn foster innovation and growth across multiple segments.”“Recent discussions surrounding the implementation of FAME 3 present a notable opportunity to enhance EV adoption in India. In light of this, any extension of the FAME subsidy and removing all caps on the ex-factory price of EVs will be pivotal in enhancing the position of tech forward companies like Ultraviolette.”Ashwin Bhandari, CEO and Co-founder of iVOOMi, suggests key fiscal measures for sustainable industry growth. He recommends, “In the upcoming budget, we propose a significant integration of GST rates for batteries and scooters, aiming to create a balanced sales taxation system while addressing key factors such as battery technology, supply chain efficiency, and market inventories. This strategic approach is poised to drive sustainable growth within the industry.”",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-ev-sector-seeks-comprehensive-support-and-innovation-boost/articleshow/111838849.cms

5. Inclusive Education and Special Needs Support

6. Reducing GST on Educational Products and Services

7. Focus on Skill Development and Future Readiness

NEW DELHI: The upcoming Union Budget 2024-25 , scheduled for presentation on July 23rd, holds immense significance for the future of school education in India. Experts and stakeholders have high expectations for the government to unveil transformative reforms that address longstanding challenges and propel the system towards greater equity, quality, and future-readiness.Stakeholders in the education sector are voicing their expectations for substantial reforms and increased investments in school education.From addressing infrastructure needs to enhancing digital learning capabilities, the budget holds the promise of shaping a more inclusive and robust education system.Experts and educators are hopeful that the government will prioritize education spending and implement policies that foster innovation, accessibility, and quality in schools. The following key demands and expectations outline the sector's hopes for transformative measures that can propel India's education system forward.A central expectation is a significant increase in budgetary allocation for the Department of School Education and Literacy. This will be crucial for strengthening the foundation of the system. Experts anticipate a renewed focus on key schemes like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS), ensuring better infrastructure, learning materials, and nutritional support for students across the country.Prateek Maheshwari, Co-Founder of PW and Chair of the India EdTech Consortium (IEC), emphasizes the need for GST exemption on educational expenses for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. He argues that students from Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Low Income Group (LIG) families should receive 100% GST exemption on all educational expenses, including test-prep courses and job-oriented skill courses. ""The current 18% GST rate is prohibitive for families with limited resources, hindering access to quality education,"" Maheshwari stated. He calls for a government mechanism to make education more affordable and clear exemptions, particularly concerning student housing.Increased budget allocation for education is a significant expectation. Maheshwari has always maintained that ""the Union budget should serve as a catalyst for education, aiming towards a more optimal allocation of at least 6% of GDP."" Current spending on education has hovered between 2.5% to 3%, which falls short of meeting the sector's growing needs. A higher allocation would support the establishment of new K-12 schools, enhance educational infrastructure, and improve overall educational outcomes across the country. This is crucial for fostering innovation and expanding educational opportunities in underserved communities.Aarul Malaviya, Founder of Zamit, underscores the significance of digital infrastructure in modern education. He asserts that the upcoming budget presents a critical opportunity to bolster digital learning capabilities in schools. Malaviya explains, ""It is imperative to allocate funds for improving internet connectivity, providing modern devices, and equipping teachers and students with essential digital skills."" Enhancing these aspects will enable interactive and personalized learning experiences, leveraging technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Such investments are pivotal for preparing students to thrive in a digital-first world and ensuring equitable access to quality education.Kanak Gupta, Group Director of Seth M. R. Jaipuria Schools, stresses the importance of investing in teacher training and professional development. Comprehensive teacher training programs and continuous professional development are essential for enhancing teaching quality and adapting to evolving educational methodologies. Gupta says, ""The budget should prioritize substantial investments in upgrading digital literacy among educators and fostering innovative teaching practices."" This initiative will empower teachers to effectively integrate technology into classrooms and cater to diverse learning needs, ultimately enhancing educational outcomes nationwide.Shridhar Venkat, CEO of The Akshaya Patra Foundation, highlights the need for inclusive education policies and support for children with special needs. He praises the interim budget's focus on nutrition and education initiatives, including the Sampoornata Abhiyaan and PM POSHAN, and hopes these will be reinforced in the final 2024-25 Budget. Venkat elaborates, ""There is a critical need to expand programs that integrate children with disabilities into mainstream education, providing them with necessary nutrition and educational support to thrive."" The budget should maintain or enhance allocations to ensure comprehensive support for children with special needs, bringing out-of-school children to mainstream education and ensuring no child is left behind due to hunger.Praveen Singh, CEO of AASOKA by MBD Group, advocates for lowering GST rates on educational products and services to enhance affordability. Singh argues, ""Reducing the GST slab from 18% to 5% on educational products and services is crucial for making quality education more accessible to all segments of society."" This reduction will alleviate financial burdens on students and parents, encouraging greater participation in educational programs and enhancing the adoption of modern learning resources. It aligns with the NEP 2020's vision of promoting multi-modal education approaches and fostering a conducive environment for educational innovation.Akshay Munjal, Founder and CEO of Hero Vired, emphasizes the importance of developing a robust tech infrastructure and fostering digital skills. Munjal points out that building a strong tech infrastructure is essential for driving growth and job creation in sectors like AI, cybersecurity, and big data. He believes the budget should prioritize investments in AI hubs, centers of excellence, and regulatory frameworks for the EdTech sector. These initiatives will equip the workforce with essential digital skills, preparing them for future job markets and positioning India as a global leader in technological innovation and education. Munjal states, ""Our policies must equip our workforce with essential digital skills and technologies, enabling India to spearhead global advancements.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2024-25-key-expectations-for-transforming-school-education/articleshow/111834659.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Elderly NGOs seek major revisions in upcoming budget to support senior citizens,"

New Delhi: With the Union Budget announcement approaching, elderly NGOs across India are urging the government to address the pressing needs of the country's senior citizens. Organisations like Agewell Foundation and HelpAge India have outlined comprehensive proposals to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, highlighting the urgent requirement for enhanced financial support, healthcare and social security for the elderly.A significant demand is the revision of the central contribution to the old age pension under the National Social Assistance Program (NSAP).The NGOs advocate increasing the pension amount from the current Rs 200-500 to at least Rs 1,000 per month for those aged over 60 years and Rs 1,500 per month for those aged over 80 years.Combined with the state government contributions, this would set a national minimum pension of Rs 1,500 to Rs 3,000 per month, depending on the state's fiscal capacity.To enhance financial inclusion and livelihoods for older persons in the rural areas, the NGOs propose scaling up the Elder Self-Help Groups (ESHGs) model nationwide. This initiative aims to improve financial, social and digital inclusion for rural elders, with similar support suggested for urban areas through the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM).Agewell Foundation has appealed for several tax-related measures to benefit the senior citizens. These include raising the basic income tax exemption limit for seniors from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, making pensions tax-free for those with annual incomes up to Rs 12 lakh and increasing tax deductions under Sections 80C and 80TTB to Rs 75,000.Additionally, they call for GST exemptions on essential services and products commonly used by the elderly such as adult diapers, medicines and healthcare equipment.Dedicated healthcare services for the elderly are also a priority. The proposals include doorstep healthcare services for immobile seniors, creation of elderly helpdesks at tertiary care hospitals and accelerated implementation of the National Programme for Health Care of Elderly (NPHCE).The NGOs stressed the importance of developing affordable geriatric health insurance products and expanding PMJAY coverage to include older adults aged over 60 years with specific income cutoffs.Encouraging the continued participation of trained and active older workers in the formal workforce is another key recommendation.Agewell Foundation suggested the introduction of a Prime Minister's Self-Employment Scheme for retired people and setting up skill training and retooling centers for seniors to empower them for income generation in old age.Creating an age-friendly environment is essential, the NGO said.This includes ensuring public spaces and services are accessible and accommodating for senior citizens, delivering nutritional kits to elderly from below poverty line (BPL) families and setting up community-based multi-service day care centers with facilities for medical, physical fitness, recreation and reskilling.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-elderly-ngos-seek-major-revisions-in-upcoming-budget-to-support-senior-citizens/articleshow/111833676.cms
indiatimes.com,What income tax changes are coming in first Modi 3.0 Budget — hike in standard deduction or basic exemption limit or both?,"Budget 2024 may hike the standard deduction limit

Budget 2024 may also hike the basic exemption limit in the new income tax regime

Can Budget 2024 hike both the standard deduction limit and basic exemption limit in the new tax regime?

Taxpayers are anticipating much-needed tax breaks from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the first Budget of Modi 3.0. Over 56% of Indians want Sitharaman to reduce the income tax burden in the upcoming Budget 2024 , according to a survey done by the Economic Times. From raising the standard deduction limit to tweaking the tax slabs in the new tax regime, hopes are high that Budget 2024 will make middle-class taxpayers happy. What are the income tax changes that you can expect from Union Budget 2024 ? ET Wealth Online spoke to experts to find out how Budget 2024 could lower your income tax burden.One of the prominent expectations is that Budget 2024 would increase the standard deduction limit. Currently, you get a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 in both new and old income tax regimes. The standard deduction is a flat deduction salaried individuals can claim against taxable salary income without requiring any proof of actual expense incurred. It was last revised in 2019. Considering the rising inflation and the increased living expenses of salaried individuals, the standard deduction limit should be hiked from Rs 50,000, according to many experts. How much hike can you expect in standard deduction from Budget 2024? Shalini Jain, Tax Partner, EY India says, ""Standard deduction may be enhanced to Rs 1 lakh to reduce the taxable income of the taxpayers.""Echoing the same, Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners says, ""Given the increased cost of living and inflationary pressures, the government may consider increasing the limit to Rs 75,000 in Budget 2024, which will benefit all salaried individuals regardless of the tax regime opted for.""Kumarmanglam Vijay, Partner, JSA Advocates & Solicitors says, ""Given the current economic conditions, if the government decides to increase the standard deduction, it is expected to be a moderate hike. A reasonable projection would be an increase up to Rs 1,00,000 as a very optimistic scenario and to Rs 75,000 in a moderate scenario.""However, the hike in the standard deduction could be in the lower range as well. Yogesh Kale, Executive Director, Nangia Andersen LLP says, ""The best estimation may be that the standard deduction is increased by another 10,000 rupees. This increase may not have a major impact on the tax revenue and hence would not be very difficult for the government to accommodate in its fiscal budget.CA Suresh Surana says, ""Standard deduction is provided to cover expenses incurred during employment, excluding professional tax. It is pertinent to note that several expenses incurred by employees during the course of their jobs are not deductible under current provisions. Additionally, the exemptions available to the salaried u/s 10 are capped at outdated limits that fail to account for inflation, rendering them ineffective. Thus, in order to address this, it is expected that such a standard deduction limit be increased to Rs 60,000 in Budget 2024 and should be adjusted annually in line with the Cost Inflation Index (CII). This would ease the tax burden on salaried individuals and maintain their purchasing power amidst inflationary pressures.""Another prominent expectation is raising the basic exemption limit in the new income regime. To make it attractive, the government increased the basic exemption limit to Rs 3 lakh from Rs 2.5 lakh in the new income tax regime in Budget 2023.There is a widespread expectation that Budget 2024 may increase the basic exemption limit by another Rs 50,000 to Rs 3.5 lakh from the existing Rs 3 lakh, says Surana.Some experts believe that it could be increased to up to Rs 5 lakh. Jain says, ""Basic exemption limit under the new tax regime may be enhanced to Rs 5 lakh to make the new tax regime more attractive and give higher disposable income to the individual taxpayers.""Budget 2024 is expected to announce some populist measures for individual taxpayers, believe experts. However, do not expect too many changes, they warn.When asked whether a hike in the standard deduction limit is likely to come or a tweak in the new tax regime, Kale answers, ""There are good chances that the standard deduction would be increased under the new tax regime, to encourage more people to opt for a new tax regime. Moreover, an increase in standard deduction stands a better chance than an increase in the basic exemption limit in view of the fact that a higher basic exemption limit is already provided under the new tax regime.""Kumarmanglam Vijay, Partner, JSA Advocates & Solicitors says, ""The basic exemption limit applies to all individual taxpayers in India that pay tax at the slab rate, regardless of the source of their income—be it from salaries, businesses, etc. Hence an increase in the basic exemption limit would benefit every taxpayer in the country rather than just the salaried shareholders. Further, the basic exemption limit has already been increased recently under the new tax regime. Therefore, another increase in the basic exemption limit again is less probable.""He further adds, ""On the other hand, an increase in the standard deduction, which currently stands at Rs 50,000, specifically benefits salaried individuals. The salaried class is rightly viewed as the most tax-burdened group, carrying a significant portion of the tax load. Standard deduction provides a flat reduction in gross income for salary earners, offering some relief from the overall tax burden. However, given the current economic climate and rising cost of living, the existing standard deduction amount is often seen as insufficient. Given the limited impact and targeted nature of this relief, it seems more likely that FM may opt to increase the standard deduction rather than the basic exemption limit in the forthcoming Budget.""Surana says, ""In the Union Budget 2024, the Finance Minister might prioritise increasing the standard deduction limit over raising the basic exemption limit. This is because increasing the standard deduction directly benefits a large segment of taxpayers, is relatively easier to implement without major revenue loss, and aligns with the government's focus on providing relief to the middle class. However, any decision will ultimately depend on the broader fiscal situation, revenue projections, and economic priorities outlined in the budgetary goals.""Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024. Few more days and you would know whether your tax burden will be lowered from the next financial year.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/budget-2024-hike-in-standard-deduction-or-basic-exemption-limit-or-both-what-tax-changes-coming-in-first-budget-of-modi-3-0/articleshow/111834715.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: ELCINA pushes to curb import dependency through innovation and domestic component design,"Source: Elcina

Source: ELCINA

With Budget 2024 on the horizon, industry body Electronic Industries Association of India ELCINA ) has highlighted the need for policies to boost the country’s electronics component manufacturing The larger goal is to reach $300 billion by 2026 and $500 billion by 2030, says the industry body, highlighting that despite advances in assembly, over 60% of components are imported, mainly from China, creating a strategic risk. To change the status quo, ELCINA asks the finance minister to use the budget to prioritise a transition from import-reliant assembly to value-added component manufacturing. This aligns with the “local goes global” and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives and will position India as a key player in the global electronics supply chain.ELCINA calls for a comprehensive policy to support electronics manufacturing in India. It emphasises the need for a well-defined strategy that addresses the key challenges faced by the electronics industry, such as high import dependence, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of skilled labour. The association says a robust policy framework will not only attract domestic and foreign investments but also enable the growth of the electronics sector, leading to job creation, technological advancement and increased exports.ELCINA further recommends measures such as tax incentives, easier access to finance, streamlined regulatory procedures, and increased focus on research and development to foster a favourable ecosystem for electronics manufacturing in India.Atul Lal, CEO of Dixon Technologies and President of ELCINA, says the importance of focussing on high-potential components cannot be overlooked in strengthening India’s role in the global value chain. Strengthening the component ecosystem will drive sustainable growth, competitiveness and resilience, he says. For this, ELCINA proposes a $10 billion incentive package from 2024 to 2030 for non-semiconductor components.“We also recommend including components and modules in the component policy. There must be a detailed categorisation across high-priority and regular-priority components, focusing on passive components, electromechanical components, wound & magnetic components, active components, other modules/sub-assemblies, and its raw materials,” he says.The industry body also wants enhanced government-industry collaboration to stimulate an electronics manufacturing boom nationwide.Vinod Sharma, MD of Deki Electronics and past president of ELCINA, says there is a need for investments from large, medium and small industries. “We propose establishing 10 world-class electronics manufacturing clusters (EMCs) to support specialised component manufacturing. These clusters will offer plug-and-play infrastructure, ensuring globally competitive operations in collaboration with state governments,” Sharma says.Another aspect that electronic manufacturers want the upcoming budget to focus on is export promotion and tax benefits to help the sector reach $20 billion in exports of electronic components and modules by 2026. This ambitious goal could be made possible through interest subventions, export credits, and improved market outreach initiatives.Rajoo Goel, Secretary General of ELCINA, says the government must focus on components, parts, modules and value-added manufacturing. ""The growth in equipment assembly will be sustainable only with strong technology acquisition, innovation and component design. This is essential to reduce dependency on imports. Extension of concessional corporate income tax rates for manufacturing firms to attract investments, especially in high-capital-output sectors like component manufacturing, is needed,"" he says.The demand for electronics components in India is projected to hit $180 billion by 2026 and $300 billion by 2030. ELCINA’s measures aim to narrow the gap between demand and production, estimated to be $248 billion by 2030. The goal is to reduce this gap to $100 billion by increasing manufacturing capacity. These expansions are expected to create a million direct jobs by 2026 and up to 5 million by 2030.To help the nation realise the aforementioned goals, the Delhi-based industry body’s ambitious policy plan proposes a support package of $8.57 billion, including $2.14 billion for capital investment incentives and $6.43 billion for PLI schemes. The incentives include 40% capex and a 7-year PLI for high-priority components, and 25% capex and a 5-year PLI for regular-priority components, contingent on meeting production thresholds.For the semiconductor industry, ELCINA advocates increasing budget allocation under the India SemiConductor Mission (ISM) to support expansion and meet a projected $100 billion demand by 2030. It also proposes workforce development initiatives, including industry-oriented Centers of Excellence (CoE) for semiconductor workforce training and skill development across strategic locations.The country’s MSME electronic firms call for a strategic shift from import reliance to value-added manufacturing. They urge prioritising domestic manufacturing for Atmanirbhar Bharat goals and policies to boost homegrown innovation and R&D.Mandeep Arora, MD & Co-founder of UBON, says, “We are optimistic this budget will foster innovation. We need measures to support digital infrastructure development, enhance manufacturing capabilities under the ‘Make in India’ initiative, and provide incentives for sustainable and eco-friendly technologies. A focus on reducing import duties on critical components and encouraging R&D investments will be pivotal to position India as a global hub in the consumer electronics segment.""Lalit Arora, Co-founder of SME electronic brand VingaJoy, wants policies that will encourage business efficiency and drive technological innovation. “We are hopeful for initiatives that encourage domestic manufacturing, reduce GST rates on essential electronics, and incentivise R&D investments,” he says.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-elcina-pushes-to-curb-import-dependency-through-innovation-and-domestic-component-design/articleshow/111817952.cms

By Surabhi Marwah

Increase in the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime – One key change expected from the upcoming budget is the increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3,00,000 to Rs 5,00,000.

Reduction in tax rates under new tax regime – It is expected to have reduced tax rates / rejig in tax slabs under the new tax regime.

Increase in standard deduction – It is expected that the standard deduction is increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1,00,000 as this limit has remained the same for the last 5 years.

Increase in deduction for interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property – It is expected that the limit for deduction towards interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property will be increased from Rs 2,00,000 to Rs 3,00,000. This may also help promote home ownership and help the government in its mission of ‘Housing for All’.

Overhaul of the capital gains tax structure – Currently there are various tax rates and holding periods for different types of instruments and also the indexation benefit differs in different situations for the purpose of computation of capital gains tax. It is expected that the government may bring about some amendments such as changes in tax rates, method of computation, period of holding etc. to have a more unified and simplified capital gains tax regime. One specific wish from a capital gains taxation standpoint would be the increase in the tax-free ceiling limit on long-term capital gains from sale of equity shares (listed) / equity oriented mutual funds from Rs 1,00,000 to Rs 2,00,000.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : The government is set to table its first full budget after elections and the wish list of taxpayers is as long as ever. This is especially so as the government did not make any key changes in the interim budget as it was a Vote on Account budget. Over the years, the government has been taking steps to make the concessional tax regime or the new tax regime more attractive for individual taxpayers.Few changes which were introduced in the last year’s budget i.e., Budget 2023 were:a) Increase in the basic exemption limit to Rs 3,00,000 from Rs 2,50,000b) Capping of maximum surcharge at 25%c) Introduction of standard deduction of Rs 50,000d) Rejig of the tax slabs.Keeping in view the government’s intent to simplify/ rationalise tax laws and enhance compliance, one may expect a few changes in the upcoming Union Budget 2024 to make the new income tax regime more attractive.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why 50% HRA exemption should include cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad At present, for individuals with gross income above Rs 15,50,000, if their total deductions and exemptions exceed Rs 3,75,000* (excluding standard deduction), the old regime is more beneficial as compared to the new one.Further, the increased cost of housing and increased awareness towards various investment instruments has led to higher claim of HRA exemptions and higher investment-based deductions (eligible under sections 80C, 80D of the Income-tax Act, interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property etc.) among salaried taxpayers and in many cases such limit of Rs 3,75,000 is easily breached resulting in taxpayers opting for existing / old tax regime.Therefore, in order to make the new tax regime more attractive and to keep up with the government’s intent of having a unified tax regime with fewer deductions / exemptions, one may expect few changes in the new regime as below:*This limit is for deductions and exemptions not available under the new tax regimeAlso Read | Income Tax expectations Budget 2024: Tax exempt limit for savings account interest to be raised to Rs 25,000?

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: More funds and focus on R&D can solve many problems of pharma sector, say stakeholders","India’s pharmaceutical industry expects the upcoming budget to boost its manufacturing capabilities and streamline regulatory compliances . Industry stakeholders say the government should also focus on creating an ecosystem that ensures pharmaceutical companies maintain the highest standards of safety.Mridul Dhanuka, Director, Orchid Pharma , expects this budget to increase allocations for healthcare infrastructure, give substantial R&D incentives and provide robust support for the sector to attain global competitiveness. “Needless to say, a substantial increase in healthcare infrastructure funding to ensure quality healthcare access is important. Significant R&D incentives are crucial to drive innovation in drug discovery and development. These are areas where India has already shown results — India’s first drug invention, Enmetazobactam, received USFDA and EMA approvals this year and several other drugs are in various phases of clinical trials,” says Dhanuka.The sector is valued at around $50 billion and contributes nearly 2% to the national GDP.He says widening the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to cover a broader range of pharmaceutical products and their basic raw materials should be another vital focus area, especially as most of these are imported from China. “It would boost domestic manufacturing and at the same time save valuable foreign exchange.”Shantanu Jindal, Partner, IndusLaw, says that government support in terms of specific schemes (similar to PLI scheme) and other tax incentives are necessary to kick-start innovation. “We need a greater allocation to the PLI scheme for pharma to make India truly self-sufficient. Also, the biotech sector and vaccination (for disease eradication) need to be allocated more resources,” adds Jindal.Stakeholders also expect the regulatory reforms to be streamlined to accelerate drug approvals so that these are in line with global standards.Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), says that the budget’s policy direction should leverage the industry’s knowledge-driven foundation and the status as a global manufacturing hub. “The thrust should be on quality and innovation. Given the high risk, lengthy development periods, and low success rates in research, continuous investment is crucial,” adds Jain. “The 2024-25 budget should introduce policies that provide direct and indirect tax benefits to encourage research and investment in becoming a global benchmark in quality.”Nikkhil K Masurkar, CEO, Entod Pharmaceuticals, urges the government to introduce policies that incentivise R&D investments. This includes increasing the weighted tax deduction for R&D expenditure from the current 100% to 200%. “This move would not only encourage pharmaceutical companies to intensify their R&D efforts but also strengthen India's position as a global hub for innovative healthcare solutions,” says Masurkar.Anil Gulati, Chairman and CEO, Pharmazz , says, ""We propose the establishment and funding of a long-term initiative aimed at developing novel pharmaceutical products in India, with international patent protection. The successful launch of even a handful of these drugs in high-revenue markets could significantly boost India's entire pharmaceutical industry. The Health Ministry and Department of Pharmaceuticals should prioritize expanding the Ayushman Bharat program, as well as implementing updated guidelines for quality drug manufacturing and pharmaceutical marketing practices.""A section of stakeholders also say that an affordable approach to make ayurveda accessible to common people is also crucial. Increased funding allocation for R&D and infrastructure development in this segment would improve medical outcomes, enhance quality standards and help achieve self-reliance. It would also help to integrate more “ayurveda acharyas” into the healthcare system and establish ayurvedic colleges across the country, says Mandeep Singh Basu, Director, Jagat Pharma.“Allocating funds towards research and development enables comprehensive case studies, clinical trials, and new drug developments, enriching the ayurvedic knowledge base and advancing science. Expanding medical services in tier 1 and tier 2 cities is essential to bridge the gap between urban and semi-urban areas. Measures to support the export of ayurvedic products, such as easing regulatory requirements and providing marketing assistance in foreign markets, are also important,” adds Basu.Industry stakeholders say that there is a need to take significant steps to reduce regulatory compliances that would greatly benefit pharma companies. There is a need to make approval processes faster and better aligned with global norms, they add.Dhanuka says aligning Indian regulatory standards with international norms would facilitate faster and more efficient approvals, allowing us to compete more effectively in the global market. Implementing digital solutions for regulatory submissions and approvals would enhance efficiency and reduce processing times, he adds.“We believe increased collaboration between the government and the pharmaceutical industry is crucial. By engaging with us to understand our challenges, the government can co-develop solutions to streamline regulatory compliance while maintaining the highest standards of safety and efficacy,” notes Dhanuka.Similarly, Masurkar says that the government should consider implementing a unified regulatory framework that harmonises standards and processes across regulatory bodies. This would not only streamline compliance requirements but also promote transparency and accountability within the sector.A section of experts says that the budget should provide greater allocation to the pharma sector. Shantanu Jindal, Partner, IndusLaw, says that the Finance Minister had in 2023 allocated only Rs 90,171 crore to the health sector, which is far less than the target of 2.5% of the GDP. “With limited funds allocated, some of the outcomes are just not achievable given the number of potential beneficiaries. In terms of expectations, I anticipate that the budget will try to incentivise production of pharmaceuticals and medical devices locally to strike a balance between access and affordability,” adds Jindal.In the last few years, there have been positive policy initiatives like production-linked incentive schemes, Ayushmaan Bharat Digital Mission (ADBDM), CoWIN (a digital vaccine delivery platform), health registry and telemedicine.“There is a lot more to be done to make India a global healthcare and research hub. To make this happen, the government should allocate a substantially higher budget to the healthcare and pharma sector and complement it with suitable tax incentives. This will help the industry grow, resolve certain issues and put it on the path to become one of the largest employers and contributors to the economy,” says Shuchi Ray, Partner, Deloitte India.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-more-funds-and-focus-on-rd-can-solve-many-problems-of-pharma-sector-say-stakeholders/articleshow/111798414.cms
indiatimes.com,"Experts call for Modi government to cut red tapism further in Union Budget 2024, boost ease of doing business","Budget 2024: Roadmap to cut red tape



India, a tough place to do business?



Streamlining GST framework





The Union Budget to be unveiled on July 23, 2024 is one of the most highly anticipated budgets by corporates as well as individual taxpayers. This budget will not only present the outlook of the third term of the Modi Government but would also set the tone of economic growth for the next five years. The interim budget in February was slightly muted with limited populistic measures and it is anticipated that the upcoming budget would focus on unfinished agenda of the Modi Government from previous terms.In past few budgets the Government has introduced various initiatives to transform India’s image from an IT / ITeS outsourcing centre to the manufacturing powerhouse of the World. The vision of creating an ‘Atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) Bharat has been backed by Government’s contribution towards research and development in sunrise opportunities, fiscal incentives such as production linked incentive (PLI) schemes and efforts to enhance ease of doing business in India. The aim of the Government is not only to foster domestic production and exports, but to also attract foreign investments.The upcoming budget is expected to focus on the roadmap defined by the Government in the interim budget of creating a Viksit Bharat (Developed Economy) by 2047. The Government would want to keep the momentum of a high single digit growth in the economy, but also be guided by fiscal prudence through the reduction in fiscal deficit. Though the taxpayers are expecting reforms in the tax structures, however, it is expected that the focus of the Government would be more on capex expenditure over revenue expenditure.With very few active PLI schemes currently available, the industry is expecting significant push towards capital expenditure, which may include introduction of another set of PLI schemes for existing and newer sectors to fuel the growth in such sectors. Among other reforms, the industry is also expecting the amendment of the extant Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Act and scrapping of the Development of Enterprise and Service Hubs (DESH) Bill, which was introduced by the Finance Minister in Budget 2022 to replace the SEZ Act.India has always been regarded as a tough jurisdiction to operate, however, the Modi Government has been obsessed with shedding this image and moving India up the ranks on “ease of doing business”. India jumped 79 ranks in a span of 5 years between 2014 to 2019 and landed at 63rd rank in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report, 2020 (last published in October, 2019 before its discontinuation by the World Bank).Subsequently, various reforms have been introduced for simplification of procedures, rationalization of legal provisions, digitization of Government processes and decriminalization of minor, technical or procedural defaults. The National Single Window System' also referred to as single window clearance, acts as a one-stop-shop for approvals and clearances for foreign as well as domestic investors.The Business Reforms Action Plan spearheaded by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade is a dynamic reform exercise which assesses all the States and Union Territories in India based on the reforms implemented by them as against the prescribed parameters. The Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, enacted in 2023, decriminalized 183 provisions of 42 Central Acts administered by 19 Ministries / Departments, paved the way for rationalization of laws, and bolstering growth of the Indian economy.The recommendations from the 53rd GST Council meeting on June 22, 2024 aimed to streamline the GST framework in India, symbolizes the opening remarks of the Government that it prioritizes growth momentum and is focussed on providing certainty to the industry. It is anticipated that the Government may abstain from introducing substantial tax reforms, rationalisation and standardization of capital gains tax, withholding tax regime, and correction of inverted duty structures are few of the key focus areas that the Government may address in the budget. The extension of concessional tax regime for manufacturing operations, which was a notable omission in the interim budget, would certainly boost the investor confidence to set up manufacturing units in India.India is considered as one of the most tax aggressive jurisdiction in the World. As of March 2022, more than INR 10.4 trillion (USD 124.5 billion) were blocked in direct tax litigation. Monetary thresholds of filing the appeals before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, High Court and the Supreme Court were enhanced in 2019 to improve India’s image and recently in March 2024, a Circular was notified by the Central Board of Direct Taxes introducing measures to reduce litigation, however, there is an urgent need to re-visit the implementation of such measures. Guidelines should also be introduced for the tax authorities to not dispute the already settled issues.Despite significant Governmental efforts, the Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) had fallen to its record lowest in 16 years in financial year (FY) 2023-24. While the reason of the decrease can be attributed to the global slowdown, scrapping of around 70 bilateral investment treaties in 2023 by India has also added to its woes. Having said that, India has signed 13 Free Trade Agreements in the last five years along with Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement with a 4-nation non-EU European Bloc and discussions with others are also underway.Amidst global slowdown, India has been one of the fastest growing economies in the World. Government’s commitment to reforms and investments has resulted in achievement of growth in the real gross domestic product of 8.2% in FY2023-24 vis-à-vis 7% in FY2022-23. The upcoming budget is also expected to provide an impetus to the growth trajectory of the Indian economy. With significant fiscal incentives, and efforts to enhance ease of doing business coupled with improving bilateral trade relations, India is expected to reach the goal of becoming USD 5 trillion economy in the World by 2027.(Aayush Nagpal is Partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co)",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/experts-call-modi-government-to-cut-red-tapism-further-in-union-budget-2024-boost-ease-of-doing-business/articleshow/111809938.cms

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: Women entrepreneurs call for increase in social support, women workforce participation","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had in the interim budget in February said that improving the social and economic conditions of women was a priority area of the government. Experts say the full budget should take more steps in this area and announce measures to further this cause.Aparajita Bharti, Co-founder at TQH Consulting, a public policy consulting firm, says the idea should be to focus on programmes that tap into the potential for entrepreneurial ventures through credit opportunities, financial literacy and skill development.There is a need for a concerted focus on schemes and announcements that create enabling infrastructure like public toilets, working women’s hostels and creches for women; reduce and redistribute their unpaid care burden and improve last-mile connectivity; engender digital and financial literacy and skills for the future of work; and provide incentives for companies to hire and advance women in the workplace.The budget needs to look at women entrepreneurs and clear some of the gaps in empowering them, says Hardika Shah, Founder & CEO, Kinara Capital. The gaps clearly indicate systemic biases, she says. Despite proven talent and business acumen, access to capital is a major obstacle women entrepreneurs face even today.“Though India has the world’s third-largest startup ecosystem, the share of funding raised by women-led startups from 2020 to 2022 was as meagre as 15% of the overall startup funding (according to a Tracxn report). Systemic biases and perception challenges often limit their ability to secure financing. Unconscious prejudices among investors and a lack of female representation in funding institutions exacerbate the situation further,” she says.The challenge is not restricted to modern startups but also extends to the MSME sector where women account for only 20% of the MSME workforce but contribute to 40% of the sector’s $400 billion credit gap, says the CEO of Kinara Capital. Women-led MSMEs often face hindrance in accessing financing because of unfavourable loan terms, complicated paperwork and collateral requirements. “Lack of role models and limited access to networks and mentors is another issue. Women are often underrepresented in entrepreneurship, professional networks and mentorship programmes, making it harder for them to access guidance from individuals with similar experiences and trajectories,” she says.The upcoming budget presents a crucial opportunity for the government to lay a road map to improve women’s workforce participation. Although during 2022-23 women's participation in the labour force has increased from 32.8% in 2021-22 to 37%, Shah says it is far from ideal. “According to Barclays, raising the workforce participation of women to 50% is imperative if India wants to achieve the 8% GDP growth that we are aspiring for. I am hopeful that the previous 6.5% allocation for the gender budget will be increased to support more programmes for girls and women at all levels across India, particularly entrepreneurship,” she says.With the right support, women entrepreneurs strive towards driving gender parity in the workplace. According to Kinara Capital’s second edition of MSMEs Insights released earlier this year, women-owned MSMEs hired 11% more women employees than male-owned MSMEs. Nearly a third of all new jobs created by women-owned MSMEs went to women employees, driving women’s participation in the workforce.Apart from increasing the allocation to initiatives encouraging entrepreneurship, the government should lay more stress on leveraging the demographic dividend, she adds. “This specifically means boosting women's participation in the workforce. Initiatives such as expanding the production-linked incentive scheme to labour-intensive sectors such as toys, furniture and apparel, as certain MSME sub-sectors can play a crucial role in creating jobs across demographics, including women,” says Shah.Even in social welfare, the budget can act as a vehicle to encourage gender-neutral policies. Shah says that while the 26-week paid maternity leave is a great move, paid parental leave policies (maternity and paternity) will be more impactful. It will foster gender-neutral hiring and will help in reducing the prejudices that are associated with the hiring of women.Further, the government should provide incentives and extend support such as providing preferential treatment in bidding processes or offering tax incentives for private sector organisations that create opportunities for women, she says. “This will encourage concerted efforts towards providing equal opportunities and empowering women to actively contribute to the workforce.”Ramesh Alluri Reddy, Chief Executive Officer, TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship, says that by 2030, over 30 million women-owned companies could generate 160-170 million jobs, potentially transforming the economic landscape. To capitalise on this momentum and address these challenges, he says the budget should extend and focus on key measures such as Mission Shakti, which empowers women through safety and empowerment initiatives. Additionally, skilling initiatives for women should be prioritised, providing access to training programmes that enhance employability and entrepreneurial skills, including apprenticeships.The government must ensure that women can balance work and life effectively by incentivising policies and promoting opportunities, he says. Providing financial incentives for night shifts, ensuring safe transportation, and implementing robust safety protocols can help women overcome these challenges, enabling them to manage familial responsibilities alongside professional commitments and participate more fully in the workforce.“To make the women's workforce ready and increase their employability, incentives for employers to adopt more gender-neutral policies are essential. A 50% rise in female workforce participation could elevate GDP growth by 1.5 percentage points. The upcoming budget should include targeted interventions such as subsidies, price regulation of crucial commodities, and direct benefit transfers (DBT) to enhance accessibility,” he says.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-women-entrepreneurs-call-for-increase-in-social-support-women-workforce-participation/articleshow/111798871.cms

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations Highlights: Will FM Sitharaman bring income tax relief for salaried taxpayers? Infra, railways capex also in focus","19:32 (IST) Jul 18

Budget 2024 expectations live: Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC securities shares his expectations from the Union Budget 2024:



The forthcoming Union Budget due in July 2024 could continue the roadmap laid out in the previous Budgets barring a small course correction. It could largely retain the revenue and expenses projections made in the interim Budget (except for the windfall dividend from RBI). This additional receipt from the RBI could be used to i) cut the fiscal deficit target to 5.0% for FY25 from 5.1% in the interim Budget thus reinforcing the inclination to stick to fiscal consolidation; ii) make higher transfers to states for capex spend iii) increase transfer under PM KISAN from Rs.6000 p.a. to Rs.7500 p.a. iv) provide incentive to income tax payers to shift to the new tax regime by providing higher standard and other deductions/higher exemption limit/changes in tax slabs.



While there exists a fear among investors about the probability of the Govt turning populist in the Budget post the recent poll outcome, we feel that the recent announcements of ministerial appointments and modest MSP hikes negates such a fear. The Govt is likely to shun the race of competitive populism through handouts and is not likely to abandon the path of fiscal prudence although it may make extra efforts to win over a larger population of rural and urban poor by incurring targeted social welfare spends. It may want to protect its image of being a responsible, clean Govt, cutting wasteful spending, eradicating corruption, bringing more transparency by reducing off-Budget items and maintaining fiscal prudence.



The Budget could bring benefits to several sectors, including affordable housing, Industrials/Engineering, Consumer goods etc. The NDA 3.0 has already announced the decision to help 3 crore additional rural and urban households for the construction of houses.



The Union Budget could see the government paving the way for foreign-domiciled Indian startups to flip their corporate headquarters back to India — via the special economic zone of GIFT City — with minimal tax implications and to woo other companies to the Gift city with tax-breaks and other sops.



MSME sector could receive special mention by way of measures to ease capital raising and relaxing norms in NPA recognition by Banks. Banks could get a leg up in deposit mobilisation by way of enhanced deduction for interest receipts by depositors. Agri revival could be a major thrust in the Budget and provisions may be made for rationalisation of GST rates on certain agricultural inputs; and enhanced capex may be considered for deployment in rural infrastructure such as irrigation, warehousing and cold chains.



Steps to discourage F&O trading by retail investors could also be announced in the Budget or ahead of it. The Govt may announce its intent to divest some stake in low float PSU stocks as they are seeing valuation bubble although the divestment target may not be hiked majorly.



An Employment Linked Incentive scheme for labor intensive sectors like toys, textiles, furniture, tourism, logistics, small retail and media & entertainment may also be announced.



Measures to bring down the interest rates in the system could trigger higher business activity, new capex announcements, reduce the interest outgo for businesses and expand valuation of stocks. For this, sticking to the fiscal consolidation path and desisting the tendency to turn populist will be appreciated.



Higher focus on capex (vs higher revenue expenses) in the Budget will send a good signal to the markets and investors – both local and global.



India's current capital gains tax structure is complex, with multiple rates depending on the type of capital asset and the holding period. There is a need to simplify this. However in case this results in higher tax outgo or longer holding period on listed securities, the markets may react adversely in the short term. As some fears on this count are getting discounted, the markets may react positively to status quo on this. We don’t think that there would be any major changes to the capital gains tax although we do not rule out higher tax burden in some form on the urban rich.



STT on HFT trades need to be raised so that the retail traders who are losers in most F&O trades are protected to some extent. However, this may impact the volumes and depth in the market and adversely affect the revenues of the exchanges/SEBI. To discourage the galloping trades in options, income from F&O trades may be treated as speculative income and not normal business income.



Current taxation on dividends in the hands of shareholders is viewed as double taxation since the company already pays taxes on its profits. Any relief from this double taxation on dividends would be appreciated.



Any measure to encourage flow of money to equity markets (directly or through MFs) will be appreciated.



We do not expect any sizeable correction in the markets before the Budget and the correction post that may be short lived unless impacted by some other trigger. However retail investors will do well to review their asset allocation and equity portfolio and rebalance their excess holdings in equities (due to the rise in values) into other asset classes and in the process take some profits out of stocks that have run up much ahead of their fundamentals in the past few months.

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Key GST-related challenges MSMEs expect to be addressed,"While Union Budget 2024 is eagerly awaited by various sectors of the economy, the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector stands at the forefront for these expectations. MSMEs constitute the backbone of the Indian economy, contributing significantly to the GDP, to overall employment, and for exports.With the advent of the GST , MSMEs have had to navigate through new regulations and compliance requirements. In the past, the government introduced several initiatives, including introduction of quarterly returns and increase in turnover threshold to Rs 40 lakhs for supply of goods, aiming to boost MSMEs.Against the backdrop of some of the aforesaid relaxations, as per recent GST@7 survey conducted by Deloitte, 78% of MSMEs have endorsed GST. Tax compliance automation, e-invoicing and timely issuance of circulars/instructions on contentious tax issues, emerged as top performance areas for government in the survey. MSMEs demonstrate robust support (69%) for these initiatives compared with larger counterparts (which was around 60%)Nonetheless, MSMEs are still facing some challenges, especially with GST compliances and hence are expecting multifold reforms some of which are discussed hereunder.Taxpayers need to reverse Input Tax Credit (ITC) along with interest, if the payment is not made within 180 days. This stringent ITC condition can be relaxed for MSMEs providing them relief from compliances and increased liquidity of funds.Government is keen to implement e-invoicing in a phased manner, as a measure to curb fake invoicing, enhance transparency and streamline tax compliances. Currently, the threshold for e-invoicing is Rs 5 crore. However, MSME taxpayers are not tech savvy and rely on third parties for issuing e-invoice for every transaction which increases compliance cost for them. This compliance can be relaxed for MSMEs in multiple ways such as specifying invoice value for issuing e-invoice, enabling mobile apps for generating e-invoice, exemption to specific sectors, etc.Under GST, the recipient is liable to pay tax under Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) in respect of specified supplies and that too, in cash. This stipulation means that small businesses and MSMEs must allocate cash specifically to meet RCM tax liabilities, which can strain their financial resources. An exemption may be considered from RCM liabilities to MSMEs having specified turnover limits and/ or eligibility to pay RCM liability using ITC. Such an exemption could alleviate their tax compliances.Currently, taxpayers are required to pay tax on invoicing basis, forcing businesses to remit GST on sales even before receiving payment from their customers. It is imperative to make a policy change and allow MSMEs to pay tax on cash basis as was prevalent under erstwhile service tax regime. On similar lines, MSMEs must be allowed the adjustment of taxes on account of bad debts which is currently a sunk cost to them.Another area where reforms can be expected is rationalization of the interest rate of 18% in case of short-paid tax liabilities. There are countless situations where such short payment of tax is not with the intention to evade tax, but on account of losses in business, cash flow challenges etc. Government must consider reducing interest rate of 18% for non-fraud scenarios for MSME taxpayers.The composition scheme offers a simplified tax payment option for small taxpayers with eligibility threshold of Rs 1.5 crores. An increase in the threshold could allow more small businesses to benefit from this scheme, thus simplifying their tax compliance and reducing their tax liabilities.MSMEs engaged in export activities need to comply with stringent conditions to prove exports, adding to their operational burden. Timely processing of export-related refunds is crucial for maintaining cash flow. Relaxing export qualification conditions and streamlining refund processes for MSMEs will enhance their operational efficiency and financial stability. For this purpose, the government may consider setting up different wings catering specifically to GST refund applications from MSMEs.The current GST compliance framework mandates MSMEs to file multiple returns, including monthly or quarterly returns, annual returns, and reconciliation statements. This intricate and frequent filing requirement creates a significant administrative burden for small businesses. Streamlining some of these compliance requirements could ease the administrative load on small businesses, allowing them to focus more on their core activities rather than navigating complex tax regulations.In conclusion, the Union Budget 2024 presents an opportunity for the government to address the unique challenges faced by MSMEs. By introducing reforms that simplify compliance, reduce costs, and enhance operational efficiency, the government can provide a significant boost to this vital sector, fostering economic growth and employment generation.Harpreet Singh is Partner, Deloitte India and Gagan Gugnani is Associate Director, Deloitte India.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-key-gst-related-challenges-msmes-expect-to-be-addressed/articleshow/111772073.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 5 things FM Sitharaman should do for taxpayers,"By Parizad Sirwalla

1. Enhancing the Tax Slabs:

2. Increase in tax rebate:

3. Enhancing the

Standard Deduction

limit:

4. Tax Benefits for Home Buyers:

5. Enhancement of long-term capital gains exemption limit

Other procedural amendments

Currently, home buyers who purchase property from non-residents (NR) are required to compute the income of the seller and deduct appropriate tax on such income. This casts an onerous obligation on the individual home buyers. In fact they are also required to obtain Tax Deduction Account (TAN) and file quarterly withholding tax returns. Contrast this with the situation where the seller is a resident – they buyer simply has to deduct 1 percent TDS on sales proceeds and file a challan-cum return without obtaining a TAN. A similar system, with a higher rate of TDS say 2 or 5 per cent, may be introduced for buyers of residential property from a NR taxpayer. Electric vehicles (EV) are the future. In line with the ESG agenda of the organization, many employers are encouraging employees to consider an EV in their employer car lease arrangement. However, the current perquisite rules provide for valuation only based on the cubic capacity of the car. Hence, it may be prudent for the Government to specific a separate value for EVs as well.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : The Finance Minister (FM) will present the full Union Budget for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 in Parliament on July 23rd. The Budget is of significant interest to individual taxpayers as they have a long wish list of the desired announcements on the personal tax front from the newly formed government.Some of the heightened expectations are as under:It is anticipated that the government may raise the income tax exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh from the current Rs 3 lakh limit under the new tax regime in the upcoming Budget. The new tax regime is the default tax regime now. However, there are taxpayers still opting for the old tax regime to avail of HRA exemption, 80C deduction, etc. Hence, this increase in the basic exemption limit would provide even further encouragement for taxpayers to opt for the new tax regime. This would provide more disposable income in the hands of the salaried/pensioned taxpayers, thereby stimulating economic activity and consumption, without complex investment/ expenditure related conditions.In the last year’s budget, the FM effected some major changes in the new tax regime to attract taxpayers towards the same. A full tax rebate was also announced on taxable income up to Rs 7 lakh. This year, there is a further expectation for an increase in such a rebate to Rs 7.5 lakh. Such adjustment would provide much-needed relief to middle-income taxpayers, potentially boosting spending and investment.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why new tax regime is likely to be made more attractive For salaried individuals, exemption towards medical reimbursement and conveyance allowance was done away with a few years ago in lieu of introduction of standard deduction. To keep pace with the ever-rising medical cost and the fuel cost, the standard deduction may be increased from the existing limit of Rs 50,000 to at least Rs 1 lakh.To boost the momentum in the real estate sector, one can expect an increase in tax benefits for home buyers. This could include increased deduction on home loan interest or principal repayment. Currently, the overall limit to claim loss under the head income from house property is restricted to Rs 2 lakhs p.a. This limit should be revisited and enhanced to, say Rs 3 lakhs p.a., to provide further impetus to the ‘housing for all’ initiative.Effective FY 2018-19, Long-term Capital Gains (‘LTCG’) exceeding Rs 1 lakh earned from transfer of equity shares of a company or a unit of an equity oriented mutual funds on which Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has been paid at the time of acquisition, are subject to taxation at 10 per cent, without the indexation benefit. To boost investor confidence and incentivize infusion of further investment into the capital market, the Government may evaluate to increase the existing exemption limit from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2023-24: Confused between old & new tax regime?

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Engineering sector seeks policies that will ease liquidity issues and encourage R&D,"Engineering companies are facing a growing financial strain and the government should use the budget to infuse liquidity to this sector, say players in the industry.“Banks should provide liquidity to engineering industries, specifically MSMEs , for purchase of new machines, equipment and technology updates so that smaller engineering firms can produce world-class products, both in volume and at affordable prices to compete internationally,” says Arun Shukla, MD of Vikramaditya engineering , a Baddi-based MSME engineering company.He advocates increased government incentives to acquire capital goods and machinery; these are now imported, putting a significant burden on engineering firms’ working capital . “The finance minister should allocate substantial funds for industrial infrastructure for MSME the way China has done, for example, for common effluent plants, testing laboratories, logistic hubs, uninterrupted electricity, etc. Unnecessary statutory and regulatory compliance burden hurting productivity needs to go away. Also, labour reforms should be imposed strictly so that exploitation can be reduced. Product-wise MSME clusters should be announced. Collateral-free funding should be available at a low interest rate for development, automation, research & development and expansion purposes,” Shukla adds.As the largest industrial sector in India, the engineering sector comprises 27% of the factories in the country. It sees demand when there is capacity expansion in infrastructure, electricity, mining, oil and gas, refinery, steel, automobiles and consumer durables. The capital goods sector, a vital part of the engineering industry, contributes 12% to India’s manufacturing output and 1.8% to its GDP.According to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), the engineering industry in India is projected to reach a market size of $125 billion by 2027, growing at a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.68% from $52.98 billion in 2022.Sorab Agarwal, Executive Director of Action Construction Equipment Ltd , says the finance minister should use the budget to bring in easy credit availability and a uniform goods and services tax (GST) for MSMEs. The Engineering Exports Promotion Council (EEPC), the apex organisation for engineering exports, says that a majority of its members are MSMEs.Apart from this, says Agarwal, increased funding for green hydrogen, the “fuel of the future”, along with new financial incentives and subsidies, will drive Bharat towards a green hydrogen economy. “Stronger focus on fair trade policies, especially focussed on tackling China through anti-dumping policies, will go a long way in infusing confidence among domestic manufacturers,” he adds.The direction of government policies in this budget will have a major effect on the stainless steel industry , says Anubhav Kathuria, Director Synergy Steels Ltd. He pitches for a sustained emphasis on infrastructure spending, the modernisation of railway infrastructure, and a more targeted approach towards shaping the stainless steel policy.Shivdutt Das, Executive Director, Vishwa Samudra Group, recommends that infrastructure investment should constitute at least 10% of the GDP. In his view, the budget should strongly emphasise infrastructure development in key areas. “I expect more focus on India’s coastline and significant expenditure on urban mobility solutions,” he says.India’s engineering exports play a major role in the country’s export mix. The sector is the biggest contributor to exports, accounting for 24% of the total and about 40% of manufacturing exports. The country’s competitiveness in this field has been rising. Notably, MSMEs account for 35-40% of total engineering exports and are crucial job providers. EEPC India suggests restoring the interest subvention to 3% for 410 tariff lines and raising the subvention rate to 5% for MSME manufacturers exporting under any tariff line. Arun Kumar Garodia, Chairman of EEPC India, points out that the repo rate has gone up from 4.4% to 6.5%. “Merchant exporters have low-profit margins, and the cost of credit affects their viability significantly. Therefore, we have requested for the extension of the Interest Equalisation Scheme to merchant exporters with a 3% subvention rate.”The industry body highlights that the popular Interest Equalization Scheme has been extended for an additional two months exclusively for MSMEs. The policy directive also says that the claims from non-MSME exporters will not be accepted beyond June 30, 2024. The issue here is that merchant exporters and large exporters were eligible for the scheme benefits for the 410 tariff lines. Many of these industries are labour intensive and have thin profit margins, making them vulnerable to competition from global peers. The EEPC maintains denying the scheme for merchants and large exporters will hurt them badly.EEPC India has also proposed that a weighted deduction of 150% given for expenditure incurred in R&D be reinstated, and 100% depreciation on investment be given for solar power generation by MSME firms. Such sops were given previously for wind power generation.The apex body has also put forward a proposal advocating for a 25% income tax slab for partnership, LLP, sole proprietor MSME manufacturing units, on the condition that they reinvest 10% of the money in their business. This will give MSMEs an extra cushion for expansion and improve their liquidity. To ensure that this 10% is kept in the business, there can be a condition that partners can withdraw only up to 90% of profits, it adds.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-engineering-sector-seeks-policies-that-will-ease-liquidity-issues-and-encourage-rd/articleshow/111771952.cms
indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: More focus on schemes such as RAMP, TUF can boost MSMEs","Allocation of more funds for schemes such as Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance (RAMP) and Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme ( TUFS ) is needed to provide major financial and technical support to MSMEs, say industry stakeholders and experts.The RAMP scheme , in particular, aims to enhance MSMEs’ competitiveness and productivity by providing financial and technical support, they add. Increased funding to this scheme would facilitate better access to capital, advanced technology and expert guidance, helping MSMEs to innovate and expand.“RAMP is a good programme for supporting innovative initiatives for MSMEs. But it was conceived for a limited number of states (six) initially, which was later expanded to cover all the states. Therefore, the amount of financial support has come down considerably. I had the privilege to go through the strategic investment plans submitted by the states which were fairly detailed and proffered many innovative interventions for MSME development,” says Anil Bhardwaj, Secretary General, Federation of Indian Micro and Small & Medium Enterprises (FISME).Ideally, each state should have got at least Rs 500 crore to make a discernible impact but the current average they have got is about Rs 100 crore. “I hope the government will expand the programme in the budget ,” adds Bhardwaj.Dhwani Mehta, Founder & Director, OpportuneHR, says that with the government’s goal to increase the MSME sector’s contribution to GDP to 50%, enhancing support to the RAMP scheme is crucial for driving growth and achieving this target.V Padmanand, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat, says that an allocation of Rs 6,062.45 crore has been made for RAMP. Some states like Maharashtra, which has more MSMEs, have been allocated close to Rs 190 crore for related interventions, while states like Punjab that have a lower MSME base have been allocated Rs 129 crore, he adds.The government should use the budget to plug the critical gaps in the credit ecosystem and resolve issues related to CGTMSE support, delayed payments and onboarding to the TReDS platform and delay in dispute resolution, says Padmanand. The budget should also create a foundation for investments in technology upgradation. “In this context, the budgetary outlays at the state level merit enhancement through increased budgetary outlays. For instance, with 47.78 lakh MSMEs in Maharashtra, the state has been allocated Rs 190 crore under RAMP. Convergence with other programmes should be a focus area. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the MSME sector, with 6.3 crore enterprises, merits an increased outlay,” says Padmanand.Bhardwaj also says that schemes such as TUFS — originally launched to give a boost to the textile industry — are beneficial for MSMEs as these bring down the cost of finance, say experts. TUFS was introduced in 1999 and has evolved over the years as the Modified Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (MTUFS), Restructured Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (RTUFS), Revised Restructured Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (RRTUFS) and finally as the Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS).Bhardwaj says schemes like TUFS are very helpful as they reduce the financing cost for MSMEs and reduce breakeven period. “It’s win-win for all. MSMEs benefit by upgrading and becoming competitive. The country benefits with a manufacturing unit that can offer assured employment and taxes. In MSMEs, therefore, CLCS (Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme) was one of the most successful schemes. If there is one scheme that should be supported on priority, it is technology upgradation schemes such as TUFS or CLCS,” adds Bharadwaj.He says that FISME has also highlighted the need for the RBI and the banks to take into account geopolitical turmoil and disruptions in global supply chains and their adverse impact on MSMEs. “We have demanded a more liberal NPA classification regime and reforms in the SMA framework for MSMEs,” he adds.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-more-focus-on-schemes-such-as-ramp-tuf-can-boost-msmes/articleshow/111771396.cms

It's a tradition followed by the Finance Ministry, where they host a halwa ceremony 9–10 days prior to the Union Budget being presented in Parliament. The ceremony marks the commencement of the process of printing the Union Budget.This ceremonial activity takes place in the basement of the Finance Ministry (North Block) within Central Delhi, home to a dedicated printing press.This year budget will be presented on July 23 in Lok Sabha.As per tradition, halwa, the popular Indian sweet dish, is prepared in a massive iron kadhai and served to the Finance Ministry staff. The tradition begins after the finance minister stirs the kadhai. This year ceremony took place on July 16 and the official X post shared the details, which read, ""The final stage of the Budget preparation process for Union Budget 2024-25 commenced with the customary Halwa ceremony in the presence of Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. @nsitharaman, in New Delhi, today.""The ceremony initiates the 'lock-in' of the proposed budget so that it is not leaked into the market until it is tabled in Parliament. To maintain secrecy over the documents, for the next 9–10 days, the North Block basement is transformed into a fortress.For about 9 to 10 days, finance ministry officials involved in the process of making or printing the budget are kept in isolation and completely cut off from the outside world, including their families. In case of any emergency, the family members of the officials have the option to leave a message on a designated number, but no direct communication is allowed. The basement of North Block houses a printing press that was traditionally used to print budget documents for 40 years from 1980 to 2020 after which the budget went digital.Take a look at the simple halwa recipe one can try at home1 cup sooji, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup ghee, 2 cups water, and 1 tbsp. cardamom powderHeat ghee in a kadhai and add sooji to it.

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: LTCG auditions for a new role in India realty show,"

NEW DELHI: The Centre is considering a change in the holding period for computing capital gains tax on immovable assets such as real estate to bring about uniformity. Currently, any capital gain from the sale of real estate held for 24 months or less is treated as a short-term capital gain. In contrast, the holding period threshold for listed equities and equity mutual funds is 12 months.The proposal suggests that property held for more than 12 months be considered long-term assets, bringing this in line with equities and equity mutual funds, a person privy to the deliberations told ET.However, there may not be any change in the tax rates for both long-term and short-term capital gain. The long-term capital gains tax on property is 20% with indexation benefits to adjust for inflation.Any short-term capital gain is added to the assessee's income and taxed at the appropriate slab rate. Additional cess and surcharge may be levied where applicable. The Centre may take up a more detailed capital gains tax regime restructuring later after wider discussion and consultations, the person added.""There may not be a major rate rejig at this stage... maybe later,"" the person cited above added.Moreover, the proposal includes some concessions for senior citizens over the existing exemptions. It may include raising the threshold for capital gains for ancestral property, or exemptions if sales proceeds are used for medical expenses and geriatric care. Inclusion in the budget will be subject to final approval by the highest decision-makers.Another official said reducing the holding period may bring more properties to market and ease price pressure. Tax experts also expect some relaxation in the capital gains tax regime, which may foster a more favourable investment environment.""Reasonable tax rates on capital gains are required to enable people to save and build a retirement corpus that they can rely on in the absence of any credible social security system in the country,"" said Kumarmanglam Vijay , partner, JSA Advocates & Solicitors.""That should in effect bridge the economic divide rather than raising the taxes on the middle classes to redistribute wealth without any accountability.""",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/budget-2024-ltcg-auditions-for-a-new-role-in-india-realty-show/articleshow/111763421.cms
indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: MSME data stack, alternative credit assessment models can bridge $530 bn credit gap, says industry","MSMEs face a credit gap of $530 billion, and only 14% of the 63 million small businesses in India have access to credit, according to a report by investment bank Avendus Capital . This issue needs to be addressed especially as MSMEs are considered a major plank of India’s economic growth with contribution of 30% to GDP, 48% to exports and the second largest employer after agriculture.Experts say the government should announce ways to reduce the credit gap in the Budget and make the sector more self-reliant. Monu Jain , Partner, Aavishkaar Capital, says the sector is forced to access credit from informal sources with high interest rates and adverse unsustainable terms. “The government has been cognisant of this aspect and have come up with multiple policy support mechanisms, but much more needs to be done. It is expected that the budget will have a specific funding pool for MSMEs — an outlay of over 10,000 crore — for financing support. MSMEs also need greater access to bank loans which are collateral-free and more aligned with a cash flow assessment. The current guarantee schemes must be rationalised and made more effective to provide incentives to financial institutions for this lending,” she says.From the policy perspective, Jain is of the view that promotion of export credit guarantee schemes by way of an incentive package can help improve working capital availability for MSMEs. “Increase in export subvention rates is required from 3% to at least 5% given the increase in interest rates in the last few years. Due to volatility in global situations, there is a need to provide them with relaxation in repayment terms beyond 90 days, to avoid being categorised as defaulters. A special dedicated fund for MSME export capacity creation and development would help MSME exporters tide over multiple issues,” she adds.Industry experts highlight the pressing need to tackle the issue of cash flow problems for the sector, in the upcoming budget on July 23. Winny Patro , CEO and Co-Founder of Recordent India, a credit and payment reporting fintech platform, says MSMEs are caught in a vicious cycle of cash flow issues. “An SME entrepreneur spends more time dealing with late payments than growing his business. There is a need to address the problem holistically, the way the banking industry got better with timely payments due to credit bureaus. MSME data stack could be one of the solutions to reduce credit risk and avoid late payments. In addition to this, benchmarking payment terms based on sectors and nature of products/services could be another solution. Hoping that the upcoming budget gives importance to solve this massive problem of Rs 10 lakh crore late payments stuck in the MSME sector in India,” he says.MSMEs are also rooting for indirect financing in order to bridge the funding gap. “We expect an increased allocation for the Fund of Funds for Startups to Rs 15,000 crore, which may benefit innovative MSMEs indirectly,” says Hariom Seth, Founder of tech marketing firm Tagglabs.Seth points out that the budget should also address the creditworthiness of the MSME workforce through implementation of skill development initiatives with an allocation of Rs 10,000 crore for PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0 or similar schemes. “We look forward to the days when alternative credit assessment models would be introduced to substantially reduce the high rate of rejection of loan applications. A 'One Nation, One KYC' system will give an impetus to the loan application process. Government-backed credit guarantee schemes for first-time borrowers can be hugely beneficial to the ecosystem,” he adds.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-msme-data-stack-alternative-credit-assessment-models-can-bridge-530-bn-credit-gap-says-industry/articleshow/111745366.cms

India’s realis estimated to grow from Rs 17 trillion today to Rs 70 trillion by 2025. This will place India in a premier league consumer market. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion and a working age cohort expected to exceed 1 billion, consumer spending in India is forecasted to surpass $4 trillion by 2030. Global corporations view India as a key market for growth, driven by favourable demographics (young population in emerging markets may drive demand for premium products) and rising disposable income (retired consumers with longer life expectancies are also ready to spend). This is attracting attention from investors and businesses worldwide.The Indian consumer durables market includes both urban and rural segments. By 2025, the Indian appliance and consumer electronics industry is expected to reach ~Rs1.4 trillion ($21.18 billion). There are tremendous opportunities here, but the sector also has several challenges such as fierce competition (require unique value propositions to stand out and capture market share), infrastructure gaps (barriers to efficient operations), and price sensitivity (to balance between affordability & profitability).The industry and stock market in India have certain expectations from India Union Budget July 2024 such as tax cuts for lower income tiers to boost disposable income & consumption and experts hope for a budget that enhances consumer spending, but an outcome will depend upon policy decisions and economic conditions. Improved spending by consumers benefits several industries such as hospitality and tourism, leisure travel, consumer durables and appliances, consumer electronics, apparel, footwear, fashion accessories, food, beverages, etc.employs around half of India’s population, making farmers integral to our sustenance. 70% of rural households depend primarily on agriculture for livelihood with most farmers being small and marginal. The country is the largest producer of milk, pulses, and spices globally; leads in areas planted for wheat, rice and cotton. India boasts the world’s largest cattle herd. It ranks second in fruit, vegetable, tea, farmed fish and sugarcane production, and is the second largest exporter of sugar.From the upcoming budget, it is expected that the government enhances allocation for crucial farm sector schemes to strengthen the rural economy . It includes higher funds for crop insurance, post-harvest loss reduction and support for dairy farmers. As India’s agriculture sector is expected to grow at ~6% in the current fiscal year (2024-25), this growth is crucial for achieving the target of $100 billion in agriculture exports.The budget may introduce measures to facilitate exports and enhance competitiveness. The previous budget announced the launch of the Agriculture Accelerator Fund to aid rural agri-startups, which may further see support in the upcoming Budget.Agtech (agriculture technology) is poised to transform India’s farming sector. By 2030, it could contribute ~$600 billion to India’s GDP, a 50% increase from 2020. Agtech solutions are more farm centric, addressing various parts of the value chain (including finance, inputs (seeds, agrochemicals) and advisory services).Agricultural reforms such as barrier free inter-state trade leads to better farmer access, in turn positively impact related sectors and companies in the stock market. The freedom to produce, hold, move, distribute, and supply agricultural products can attract private sector and foreign investments into this sector. Increased investment in cold storages, and modernization of food supply can benefit companies involved in logistics, warehousing and infrastructure, etc.The Indianindustry is a crucial driver of the country’s economy. Pre-pandemic, manufacturing sector contributed around 16-17% to India’s GDP. It encompasses automotive, engineering, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and consumer durables. The industry is expected to be one of the fastest growing sectors. By 2030, India has the capacity to export goods worth $1 trillion. India is gradually moving towards focusing on automation and process driven manufacturing. Initiatives like the National Manufacturing Policy aim to increase the sector’s share in GDP to 25% by 2025.The manufacturing sector is looking for inclusive growth, global competitiveness and visionary reforms in Budget 2024. Industry leaders hope for long standing ecosystem positive measures, introduction of production linked incentive schemes for recycling secondary materials, GST rationalisation across scrap categories, adoption of alternative fuels, embracing technology for survival and profitability, etc. Some of the macro challenges for this sector remain, such as, not so friendly trade and taxation policies, India to regain its position in global supply chain, and the Chinese manufacturing ecosystem poses stiff competition, to name a few.India's infrastructure sector is estimated to be $204.06 billion in 2024 and projected to reach $322.27 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 9.57% during this period. India’s goal of achieving developed nation status by 2047 hinges on strengthening its infrastructure and in FY2024, the government has allocated 3.3% of GDP to this sector, focusing on transport and logistics. Roads, highways, railways, and urban public transport are key investment areas.The government aims to construct a 2 lakh-km national highway network by 2025, expand airports, operationalize waterways and establish Multi Modal Logistics Park (MMLPs). The Budget 2024 is likely to prioritize urban development projects (smart cities, sustainable infrastructure in tier-2 and tier-3 cities). Expect increased allocation for railways, roads, aviation and ports. While the interim Budget 2024 didn’t propose significant tax amendments, it extended sunset dates for certain tax benefits related to this sector until March 2025. Companies across various sectors, including power, telecom, roads and ports are benefiting from infrastructure growth and in turn drive the stock market growth.The total size of India’s budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 stands at Rs47.66 trillion, which is 6.1% larger than the revised estimate for 2023-24. The capital expenditure outlay for the next year has been increased by 11.1% (to Rs11,11,111 crore), equivalent to 3.4% of the GDP. The budget reflects the government’s focus on development & economic growth.There is an anticipation from the industry that the coalition government budget may focus on fiscal consolidation while boosting manufacturing, infrastructure and rural sectors. Additionally, it is expected that measures would be taken to enhance consumption, support agriculture and provide relief on personal taxation. Budget should enhance consumer spending & infrastructure development, benefiting businesses and investors.Thewant (a) the tax treatment between Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) and mutual funds to be equitable and latter to be more tax-efficient, (b) switching between different mutual fund schemes to be exempted from capital gains tax, (c) mutual funds could be used for accumulating retirement savings, thereby getting the tax benefits same as National Pension Scheme (NPS), (d) return of indexation benefits for fixed-income funds.Apart from the above, manyare hoping for an increase in standard deduction limit for income tax, providing relief to salaried individuals, it is wait and watch for curtain to get raised on July 23, 2024, when actual Union Budget gets presented.the market would want lower capital gains, lower dividend taxes and all the way to no taxes on dividend or no long-term capital gains. Allow more competition so more companies compete for consumer demand and that lowers the prices of products and services. We can do with more foreign investments in Indian stock market and in industries. Improve the standard of living of people to go up from lower income to middle class, more jobs, etc.(The author Priti Goel is Founder & CEO of Prisha Wealth Management.

was allocated Rs 70,000 crore, a 27.3% increase from the revised estimate of Rs 55,000 crore in 2022-23. Allocation for the Ministry of Jal Shakti was also increased by Rs 23,249 crore (31.4%) in 2023-24, driven by increased funding for the Jal Jeevan Mission. PM-KISAN maintained a constant allocation of Rs 60,000 crore, while MGNREGS saw a 33% reduction to Rs 60,000 crore. Notable increases were seen in allocation for 2023-24 include the Reform Linked Distribution Scheme (101.2%), Swachh Bharat Mission (74.2%), and Guarantee Emergency Credit Line for MSME borrowers (34.3%).

Over 100 million middle income households will be added to the Indian economy in this decade. The Union budget presents an opportunity to increase consumption across consumer and retail sectors by focusing on investments in agriculture , food processing, housing, and infrastructure. Some of the key areas of focus are included:An Agriculture Accelerator Fund has been instituted to promote agricultural startups in rural areas. As part of the PM Matasya Sampada Yojana, a sub-scheme with an investment of Rs 6,000 crore was launched to support fishermen, fish vendors, and MSMEs.Furthermore, decentralised storage facilities have been established across multiple states to enable farmers to store their produce. The PM Program for Restoration, Awareness, Nourishment, and Amelioration of Mother Earth (PM-PRANAM) was also introduced to incentivise states and Union Territories to promote balanced use of chemical and alternative fertilisers. In 2023-24, total expenditure on subsidies is anticipated to be Rs 4 Lakh crore, marking a decrease of 28.3% from the revised estimate of 2022-23. This reduction was attributed to lower allocations for food subsidy and fertiliser subsidy , which were inflated in previous years due to the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana and global fertiliser price hikes, respectively. These interventions helped boost the growth of agriculture apart from supporting farmers in their challenging times with erratic rainfall over the last two seasons. This budget is expected to directionally continue to encourage greater public and private investment in agriculture that can enhance productivity, reduce subsidies, and promote sustainability.Various schemes have also helped enhance private consumption promoting the growth of the consumer industry including:On the supply side, the government has consistently worked to position India as an attractive destination for global manufacturing. The food processing industry has experienced substantial growth, bolstered by access to funds through the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Under the PLI Scheme for Food Processing, the sourcing of raw materials from India has increased significantly, contributing to higher incomes for Indian farmers and MSMEs. The PLI schemes have attracted investments exceeding Rs 1.03 lakh crore as of November 2023 and have contributed to improving exports. The PLI schemes have also generated over 6.7 lakh jobs. The ongoing implementation of the PLI scheme is projected to further expand food processing capacity by an additional Rs 30,000 crore and create approximately 250,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities by 2026-27.In the fiscal year 2023-24, the government planned to extend its scheme offering interest-free loans for over 50 years to state governments, with a total outlay of Rs 1.3 lakh crore. This initiative aimed to support one hundred crucial transport infrastructure projects focused on enhancing connectivity. The total investment for these projects were projected at Rs 75,000 crore, including Rs 15,000 crore from private sources.A new Urban Infrastructure Development Fund has been established to facilitate the development of urban infrastructure by public agencies in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Managed by the National Housing Bank, the fund has received an annual allocation of Rs 10,000 crore. States and cities were incentivised to adopt urban planning reforms, including efficient land use and transit-oriented development. The allocation for Road Transport and Highways was slated to increase by Rs 53,408 crore (24.6%) in 2023-24, primarily aimed at expanding capital outlay on roads and bridges. The impact of this has been revolutionary for the Indian economy and made India the owner of the second largest road network globally. These initiatives have helped connect the rural areas to urban centers, opening newer markets for the consumer industry. Further strengthening of allocations for these investments will help promote consumption in rural India which has been a challenge over the past few years.The budget allocation for the current year is expected to closely align with previous trends, highlighting stability in the government's policy making. Continued capital spending on improving infrastructure and manufacturing will reinforce the 'Made in India' initiative and advance the objective of 'Atma-Nirbhar Bharat.' By providing balanced support for both demand and supply sides of the industry, the budget can drive sustained growth in the consumer sector.The writer is Anand Ramanathan, Partner and Consumer Products and Retail sector Leader, Deloitte India with inputs from Phanish Kumar and Biswadip Mandal.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/policy-trends/budget-2024-analysing-the-impact-of-previous-budgetary-allocations-on-overall-consumer-business/articleshow/111743921.cms

Budget 2024 expectations: Mega changes in insurance

Budget 2024 proposal: Composite license for insurers to provide life, health, and general insurance policies

Budget 2024 expectations: More insurance players to enter the market with more products focused on your need



Budget 2024 proposal: One-time registration for insurance intermediaries

Budget 2024: Will insurers sell other financial products such as mutual funds?

The government plans to introduce a Bill seeking amendments to the Insurance Act, of 1938, during the upcoming Budget session, sources told the ET Wealth Online. Some of the provisions could be a composite insurance license to allow life insurers to underwrite other insurance policies, simplified investment rules, one-time registration for intermediaries, and allowing insurers to distribute other financial products, three people confirmed. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will announce Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024. Here are the changes to expect in the insurance sector.The provision of composite licenses will allow life insurers to underwrite health insurance or general insurance policies. According to the Insurance Act, of 1938, life insurers can only offer life insurance covers, while general insurers can offer non-insurance products like health, motor, fire, marine, etc. So, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) does not allow composite licensing for insurance companies. So, currently, insurance companies cannot offer both life and non-life products as one entity. However, the upcoming amendment in the Act during the Budget session, is set to change this rule — a single entity could soon offer life and non-life products.Commenting on this move, Sumit Bohra - President, of the Insurance Brokers Association of India (IBAI) says, ""Allowing life insurers to underwrite health insurance will be a good idea as the Life Insurance companies have a good background about the health of the insured (while underwriting him for life proposal) and it is their interest about the longevity of the insured through better medical facility to save on the claims under life insurance policies.""If this is allowed, the insurance companies are likely to launch combi products where the life insurer will act as the lead insurer. This move will allow customers to buy comprehensive insurance coverage under a single policy as insurers can offer bundled products now.The draft Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2023, likely to come during the Budget session, is set to ease the minimum capital requirements for insurers while reducing the solvency norms. Currently, the minimum capital of Rs 100 crore is required for life, general, and health insurance businesses and Rs 200 crore for reinsurance businesses, as per the law. The proposed amendments is expected to allow the regulator to set varying minimum capital based on the classes/sub-classes of insurance businesses the insurer engages in. Experts point out that the ease of capitalisation requirements can help more players who focus on micro-insurance or agriculture insurance to enter the insurance market. It would serve two purposes — The change in provisions would bring more affordable insurance options for customers from a need-based approach while it would create more jobs in the insurance sector. Bohra says, ""Differential capital requirements depending upon the area of operation or sector is a welcome move but the reduction in solvency margin may not be a good idea as this may lead to systematic risk build up in future.""There are also proposals to issue captive licenses for insurers, change in investment regulations, one-time registration for intermediaries, and allow insurers to distribute other financial products, sources said. A ""captive insurer"" will be a general insurance company undertaking business exclusively for its holding/subsidiary/associate companies. This move may allow conglomerates to incorporate an insurer to cover business-related risks within their groups.Gaurav Dubey, Founder and CEO of LivLong 365, a health-tech startup says, ""One of the primary expectations from the budget is passing of Insurance Act which allows the issuance of specialised licenses like OPD solutions under health insurance category. Such a license would encourage innovation and provide a progression towards preventive healthcare there by reducing overall healthcare expenses for a country like India. Also, regional licences for the health insurance business are needed, as this can lead to more tailored and effective policy design and administration, ensuring that the unique healthcare needs of different regions are better met in the long run.""Pavanjit Singh Dhingra, Joint MD, Prudent Insurance Brokers says, ""One-time registration for insurance intermediaries is a welcome step in the maturation of the Indian insurance market.""He further adds, ""Under the initial licensing conditions, licenses were for a period of three years and subject to renewal which limited capital inflow into the sector and affected the perception of business continuity. With this welcome move, insurance intermediaries will play a critical role in the vision of 'Insurance for all' by 2047.""Anuj Parekh — Co-founder and CEO at Bharatsure, says, ""The proposed amendment for one-time registration of intermediaries represents a significant stride in the right direction. It promises to alleviate compliance burdens and foster growth in the country’s distribution ecosystem.""Another proposal is to allow insurers to provide ancillary services related to the insurance business to policyholders.There is also a proposal to permit insurers to distribute other financial products as may be specified by regulations issued by the insurance regulator, say sources. When asked about what kind of financial products insures could sell, the sources say that it is believed that the proposed Bill may allow insurance companies to distribute other products such as mutual funds. Will it be a good move for customers? Well, only time can tell how the cross-selling of products through insurance channels will work. Bohra adds, ""I am not in favour of distribution of other financial line products as we need a specialist for every field and cross-selling will lead to mis-selling or forced sell and may not be favourable to the customer.""""The draft Bill is ready and it has to go to the Cabinet for its approval, sources said, adding that the finance ministry is hoping that it gets introduced in the upcoming session"" the news agency PTI mentions. More details may be available once the bill is introduced.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/insure/budget-2024-mega-insurance-changes-combi-products-offering-life-health-insurance-soon-will-insurers-sell-mutual-funds/articleshow/111758261.cms

Taxpayers hope Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will make revisions in areas such as standard deduction, tax slabs, and HRA limits to ease their burden and encourage spending. Here are the key expectations for salaried and professional taxpayers in Budget 3.O. Watch!



Budget Expectations: As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the upcoming Union Budget on July 23 in Parliament, standard deduction to Rs 1 lakh and increasing tax break among others are some of the expectations for the common man that consultancy firm KPMG expects.""There has been a significant rise in medical expenses, fuel costs and overall inflation. Keeping in mind the increase in personal expenditure it is popularly expected to enhance the standard deduction to Rs 1 lakh from the existing limit of Rs 50,000,"" said the firm in a note.The Union Budget will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led coalition government's first major policy announcement after the 18th Lok Sabha polls.With the objective to have more net disposable income which can either be spent on consumer goods or channelised as savings, it is a popular expectation that the basic tax exemption limit under the default new tax regime be increased to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 3 lakh, it said.Read More: Income tax cut in Union Budget 2024: India’s middle-class is asking for it but may not get it With regard to housing loans, the firm believes said there is mounting pressure on the real estate sector with recent hikes in interest rates and regulatory reforms.To solve these challenges and foster home ownership, it is suggested that the government may reconsider allowing deductions for interest on self-occupied housing loans even under the new default tax regime or enhancing the deduction in the old tax regime to at least Rs 3 lakh.Irrespective of the tax regime, it said, the capital gains tax structure in India today is multilayered and has differential rates for different types of assets.Even the period of holding for a capital asset to qualify as long-term (vis-a-vis short term) varies significantly e.g., for listed equity shares it is 12 months whereas for real estate it is 24 months and for debt instruments, it is 36 months, it said.Read More: Union Budget 2024 may test Modi govt’s fiscal prudence as it attempts to fulfil Lok Sabha manifesto promises ""While historically there may have been reasons for creating a complex structure in line with this government's stated objective of simplifying the tax system it may be worthwhile to provide a more uniform capital gains tax structure (both in terms of period of holding and rate of tax),"" it said.From the customs standpoint, it expects continued focus of the government on alignment of tariff rate changes with the industrial policy objective of encouraging deeper value addition in India.Coordination of change in Customs tariff rates and roll out of technical barrier to trade is also expected to continue, it said.(with agency inputs)",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-double-standard-deduction-to-rs-1-lakh-and-more-on-the-table-that-need-nirmala-sitharamans-attention/articleshow/111732345.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why new tax regime is likely to be made more attractive,"By Tanu Gupta

Popularizing the New and Simplified Personal Tax Regime

Increasing the standard deduction

Direct payment of income tax refund to overseas bank accounts

(The author is Partner Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP. Views expressed are personal)

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Increase in the limits of various exemptions and deductions is one of the prime expectations of the individual taxpayers from any Union Budget. But with the current government’s focus on a simplified tax regime with minimal exemptions and deductions, do the taxpayers need to adjust their old-time favorite expectation ? Should the taxpayer expect tax reliefs in the New Tax Regime instead ? Either way, the individual taxpayers have high hopes from this Budget, especially in the absence of any tax proposals announced in the interim budget in Feb 2024.In this article, I list some of the expectations of individual taxpayers from the Union Budget 2024 to be presented on 23 July 2024.A New Personal Tax Regime was introduced in Budget 2020 which was simple, in the sense that it allowed for very limited exemptions and deductions. To increase the takers for this regime and make it more tax beneficial for them, the Government then brought several changes in the new regime. Such as allowing standard deduction , higher basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh (as against Rs 2.5 lakh in the old regime), wider tax slabs, reduced surcharge from 37% to 25% on incomes above Rs 5 crore, nil tax liability for individuals with incomes up to Rs 7 lakh etc.The government further made it a default tax regime w.e.f. FY 2023-24, continuing to move to its vision of a simplified tax system in India.Marching towards the same goal, I expect that the government may propose further changes in the regime, to attract even those taxpayers who are still opting for the old tax regime. This may involve either further relaxing the slabs by widening them or restructuring them. Currently, 30% tax rate is applicable on incomes above Rs 15 lakh. The government may increase the same to Rs 20 lakh.Also Read | Budget 2024: Government may offer guarantee under NPS to allay fears Standard deduction is a vanilla / blanket tax deduction allowed to the salaried taxpayers, irrespective of the expenses or investments done by them.To provide further tax relief to the salaried taxpayers while keeping the tax system simple, I expect that the government may increase the standard deduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime.The income tax return form provides for mentioning the foreign bank account for direct credit of income tax refund, where the Non-Resident taxpayer does not have an Indian bank account. However, practically, such a facility is not yet active and the refunds cannot be credited to the foreign bank account for the NR taxpayer.Also Read | Income Tax expectations Budget 2024: Tax exempt limit for savings account interest to be raised to Rs 25,000? With a focus to improve taxpayer services and increasing use of technology and digital platforms in the tax system, I hope that the government activates the facility of direct credit of tax refund to foreign bank accounts.With India on its track to “Viksit Bharat” by 2047, and with a high growth target, the Government may put more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers, so as to further fuel consumption and growth of the economy. Therefore, one may expect some tax reliefs in the Union Budget 2024, however, they may continue to be along the same theme followed in earlier budgets – simplifying and rationalizing the India tax system!",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-why-new-tax-regime-is-likely-to-be-made-more-attractive/articleshow/111717575.cms

Furthermore, alleviating pressure on banks from infrastructure debt can be achieved by establishing a new entity to purchase bonds from greenfield infrastructure projects and aggregating them for retail and institutional investors.

Addressing cash flow challenges in infrastructure projects is paramount. Allowing infrastructure projects to distribute all available cash to investors, irrespective of accounting profits or regulatory restrictions, will boost investor confidence and enhance project viability.

Reduction of GST on edtech services



Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024.. This will be the first budget of the BJP-led NDA after Prime Minister Narendra Modi began his third term. All eyes will be on how the government plans to meet the rising demands of the education sector amidst a bigger push towards tech and skill-based learning and the ongoing controversies surrounding important entrance examinations.Here is a look at what stakeholders expect from the Union Budget 2024 for the education segment.Abhishek KG, Co-founder of Clapingo, a platform for online spoken English classes, expects the upcoming budget to prioritise improving digital networks, recognising their key role in advancing India’s tech-driven growth. “According to the Annual Status of Education Report 2023, almost 90% of young people have access to a smartphone at home, with approximately two-thirds utilising it for educational purposes. However, the existing 18% GST on online education imposes a significant financial strain on learners nationwide,” he says. His wish list includes policies that empower startups to thrive and contribute to the country’s global tech leadership.Educationists and stakeholders in the education sector mostly laud the GOI’s focus on digital learning, which is in line with the vision of National Education Policy 2020. Anil Nagar, Founder and CEO of Adda247, which is India's largest vernacular test prep platform caters to more than 50 million students from Tier II and Tier III cities, says that ""More funds for the Education Ministry will help improve digital infrastructure, skill-based learning, and global education partnerships, particularly in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Moreover, with lowered GST on educational services, we will be able to make our services more affordable and students will get easier access to student loans,” he says. These initiatives can help empower the youth with relevant job skills, believes Nagar.It is expected that the budget will also focus on enhancing infrastructure, advancing teacher training, and promoting inclusive education. According to Rustom Kerawalla, Founder Chairman of VIBGYOR Group of Schools, emphasis on these can lead to equitable access to high-quality education and build a resilient system that prepares students for real-world scenarios.“These factors, coupled with technology, will play a pivotal role in shaping a dynamic and experiential learning environment. Through collaborative tech-driven solutions, infrastructure upgrades, comprehensive training, advancements in pedagogy, and adapting to new-age learning methodologies, we can unleash the potential of educational reform. I strongly believe that with these measures, India can establish a future-ready education system that is inclusive, equitable, and globally competitive,” says Kerawalla.Manav Subodh, Founder of 1M1B (One Million for One Billion), an AI-focussed skilling organization, is a champion of green education , skilling and Artificial Intelligence .“As India races to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, the 2024 Union Budget must embrace the transformative potential of green skilling and AI. These emerging areas are key to unlocking a sustainable future and powering India's economic growth,” he says.Subodh further suggests that the government should encourage the PPP model in green skilling and set up Green Skill Academies in different states to address the immediate need to equip 1 crore youth with green skills by 2025, integrating these programs with the Skill India Mission.“This will not only create jobs in the burgeoning green economy but also, help India meet its climate commitments. Additionally, the budget should create a dedicated fund and provide incentives for climate technology and AI startups,” observes Subodh.“The budget must establish AI hubs and centres of excellence focused on open-source AI, democratising access, and enabling indigenous use case development addressing local sustainability challenges in areas like transportation, agriculture, and energy efficiency,” he adds.Rohin Kapoor, Partner, Education and Skilling - Management Consulting, BDO India, has a pretty long wish list while it comes to the Education Budget 2024. Here is a look at them:Under the current rules, services offered by edtech companies attract 18% GST. “This impacts affordability in online education. This is a concern which edtech companies have been talking about since the last budget session. A reduction in GST on edtech services will lower service prices, boost affordability. We are hopeful the government will consider lowering the GST from the current 18%,” says Tarun Saini, CEO & Co-founder, Vidyakul, which is India’s first vernacular e-learning platform, aiming to make education more accessible in tier-II and tier-III cities.

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: 45-day payment rule for MSMEs must come to an end, industry says","The 45-day payment rule for MSMEs , which came into effect on April 1 this year, has caused more distress than relief for the industry and needs to be relaxed, say stakeholders. Jayanth Mutha , Director of agri-electrical company Himlite Products, says while the intention was correct, the scheme has failed sorely. “There is a big necessity to take away this ruling and bring in something better,” he says.In a bid to address the issue of delayed payments faced by MSME units, Section 43B(h) was introduced in the Income Tax Act mandating payments to Udyam-registered micro and small entities within 45 days. The new rule said buyers would have to pay interest on the amount in case of payment delays to a registered MSME unit.The law ’s intent essentially was to encourage larger enterprises to settle dues with MSME vendors within a defined time frame, thereby making it more transparent and streamlined. However, MSMEs do not find it an apt solution to address the financial constraints faced by them, and many exporters also wanted an exemption from the rule. Smaller enterprises even claimed it would discourage their buyers from doing business with them.Mutha expects the upcoming Budget to cover aspects such as cheque insurance and bill discounting, instead of this rule. “In the case of cheque insurance, it will be guaranteed that a customer’s cheque would get passed by the bank. It would be between the banker and customer. Bill discounting will entail a banking entity in between, ensuring that the relationship of a MSME manufacturer and customer does not go astray,” he adds.Besides this, he directs attention to bringing changes in the MSME Samadhaan scheme, which was launched to facilitate online applications on delayed payments. “It is very cumbersome in its process and needs to be simplified to such an extent that the process of raising a complaint and execution of it becomes easy,” he states.A standard operating procedure for MSMEs on how to give credit, Mutha adds, will be key to making the ecosystem more orderly and transparent.Affirming these views, Puran Dawar, President, Agra Footwear Manufacturers & Exports Chamber (AFMEC), says the MSME payment policy of 45 days is not practical. “Like exporters, we have a minimum 60-day production process, 30-day transit process, 90-day letter of credit. So 180 days is the minimum cycle. If payment is not done in 180 days, there should be a penalty accordingly,” he says.He suggests that delayed payments lead to a 12% interest, and 24% interest if it goes beyond 180 days. “This law must be taken back. It is not feasible,” he adds.Expectations are rife that Budget 2024 will relax the provision of making payments to MSMEs within 45 days. With India’s 63 million MSMEs facing this problem, such a change can go a long way in keeping the buyer-seller equations intact, while also ensuring a steady flow of the payment cycle.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-45-day-payment-rule-for-msmes-must-come-to-an-end-industry-says/articleshow/111678310.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Let’s put money in R&D to make manufacturing roar,"

Budget Expectations: As India aspires to become a developed nation by 2047, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman who will be presenting the Union Budget on July 23, will have to power a major push for Research and Development (R&D) to boost the up-and-coming manufacturing industry.“We are working on making India a manufacturing hub. But of course, it has to be Aatmanirbhar as well,” she said in an exclusive interview with ET back in April.In the last Budget presented by the Finance Minister, which was a vote on account owing to the Lok Sabha elections scheduled for April and May, R&D received a big boost with a corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore. ""A corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore will be established with a 50 year interest free loan provided. The corpus will provide long term financing or refinancing with long tenors and low or nil interest rates,” informed a senior official to ET.Read More: Union Budget 2024 may test Modi govt’s fiscal prudence as it attempts to fulfil Lok Sabha manifesto promises However, the major obstacle for the government to tacke in the Budget would be to hike the share of R&D in the country, which remains lowest in the world, a NITI Aayog report stated. India's share of R&D in overall GDP is much lower compared to developed countries, and this has been a long-standing demand of industry bodies including Nasscom.In the past three decades, the Centre has made significant efforts to increase the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP from the present 17 per cent to 25 per cent.The government is planning an R&D wing under the proposed India Semiconductor Research Centre (ISRC) that will focus on semiconductor research which can ""quickly go into industrial production"", reported ET citing sources.Read More: Read More: Income tax cut in Union Budget 2024: India’s middle-class is asking for it but may not get it The dedicated R&D wing will be separate from other research work under the ISRC where the project gestation period is longer. According to the proposal, ISRC will focus on R&D work in developing the next generation of semiconductors, packaging and systems technologies, processes, and materials.A senior official revealed to ET that the finer details of the scheme are likely to be announced in the full budget that is set to be presented soon. Depending on the feasibility of the scheme, the dedicated R&D centre can also be spun off into an independent entity, another official said to ET.Apart from the manufacturing industry, many sectors under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme are urging the government for R&D incentives. In the pre-budget consultations with the Finance Minister, the drugmakers have requested to raise allocation for R&D to encourage innovation in the industry. ""I think the government is evaluating on how their existing scheme is working...but industry is expecting a policy from the government to boost research and development in companies,"" said HIV drugs maker Hetero Drugs' Chairman Partha Saradhi Reddy to news agency Reuters.Meanwhile, India's upcoming budget may address the inverted duty structure on various goods to boost local manufacturing. The inverted duty structure means that some finished products have lower import duties than their raw materials, which discourages domestic production. The government is looking to rationalize duties on inputs for electronics, copper tubes, ferro alloys, textile fibers, and certain chemicals to correct this imbalance. This move is aimed at making local manufacturing more competitive and reducing dependency on cheaper imports.Read More: Budget 2024: How Nirmala Sitharaman can lay the infra bricks for a Viksit Bharat by 2047 The commerce and industry ministry has conducted a cross-sectoral study to identify and rationalize these inverted duty structures. A list of products affected by this issue has been shared with the finance ministry. The list includes sectors like furniture, jewelry, petrochemicals, and medical equipment, which suffer from higher duties on inputs compared to finished goods. The rationalization of these duties is expected to be a significant step in the July 23 budget announcement.Inverted duty structures create a disadvantage for Indian industries, particularly those involved in ferro alloys, aluminum, copper pipes and tubes, textile staple fibers, and some chemical preparations. This issue is further complicated by India's free trade agreement with the ASEAN bloc, which impacts the customs duty structure due to exemptions and trade agreements. To address this, the government is focusing on sectors like woven cotton fabrics, polyester and cotton yarn, pumps and compressors, carbon electrodes, sulfur, certain acids, and taps and valves.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-lets-put-money-in-rd-to-make-manufacturing-roar/articleshow/111685256.cms

The US-India Strategic Partnership Forum has urged Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to ensure a stable and predictable tax environment as she prepares for her annual budget later this month. The US-India Tax Forum, a dedicated Tax Policy Forum of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), said this in a set of recommendations to Sitharaman.In a press release by USISPF, the tax forum said that a stable and predictable tax environment is imperative to boost investment sentiment across sectors.""The industry eagerly anticipates the Union Budget 2024-25 , the first budget of the re-elected Government, which is expected to introduce measures that will stimulate growth across sectors,"" it said.Asserting that an investment-led growth strategy is essential to support India's economy, it said measures are needed to enhance the ease of doing business, rationalise the cost of doing business, and simplify tax rates and tariffs.The business community looks forward to tax efficiency measures and clarifications that will address transactional issues around the tax legislation, unlocking growth and investment opportunities, USISPF said.Observing that rationalisation of corporate tax rates has long been an ask for companies across sectors, the US-India Tax Forum suggested bringing parity in tax payable by domestic and foreign players in multiple sectors.""This would ensure a level playing field in sectors such as banking where foreign banks' branches pay high taxes in India.

When Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents her seventh Budget on July 23, it will be seen as a platform for the Modi government to showcase how it plans to manage allies' new financial demands, and also establish its vision and reform agenda for the next five years. Most brokerages expect the Budget to signal policy continuity and a strong focus on fiscal consolidation.""We expect the government to lower its FY25 fiscal deficit target to 5% of GDP from 5.1% set in the interim budget. From a signaling perspective, there is an incentive for the government to project stability and an uncompromising focus on fiscal consolidation, despite the weaker political mandate,"" Nomura analysts Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi said in a note.Citing reports, Nomura said the government may look to boost consumer demand by raising the standard deduction limit for taxpayers under the ‘new’ tax regime (alternate regime introduced with no exemptions but lower tax rates) and possibly increase the exemption on income from bank interest. Other likely measures include lowering the personal income tax rate for those in the Rs 5 lakh to 15 lakh bracket.The government is likely to increase the outlay on rural sector schemes, with subsidies for housing to be increased by Rs 23,000 crore (~0.07% of GDP) as well as increased outlays for rural roads and employment. There are also reports of an expansion of the public health insurance programme and a renewal of the economic empowerment programme for women (Lakhpati Didi).Nomura expects the government to maintain its focus on promoting domestic manufacturing and announce an increase in the minimum local content requirement for public procurement, revive the concessional corporate tax rate of 15% for new manufacturing facilities, overhaul the 2019 national policy around electronics global value chain integration, and extend the PLI scheme to electronic components.The focus on public capex will remain a key tenet of the government’s economic strategy, Nomura said, adding that it expects the government to dial up its total capex outlay to 3.5% of GDP, from the 3.4% of GDP presented in the interim budget. Given states’ demands, the government could raise the unconditional amount transferred under the 50-year interest-free loan for infrastructure spending.Since this is the first Budget after the elections, it will be an important platform for the government to establish its medium-term economic vision and the reform agenda, the analysts said. “In particular, we expect the government to present its vision for India to be a developed economy by 2047, and how that translates into specific goals over the next five years,” it said.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/budget-2024-may-be-focused-on-these-5-themes-predicts-nomura/articleshow/111680232.cms

: Ahead of the Budget for 2024-25, the US-India Tax Forum has suggested the government to bring parity in tax payable by domestic and foreign players in multiple sectors.This, dedicated Tax Policy Forum of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum ( USISPF ), has submitted to the government that it would ensure a level playing field in sectors like banking, where foreign banks' branches pay high taxes in India.The Tax Forum was officially launched on February 25, 2020.Acknowledging the global developments around the minimum tax deal, the Tax Forum has highlighted the inherent need to rationalize corporate tax rates.The US-India Tax Forum has submitted its recommendations on tax amendments for the Union Budget 2024-25 , to be presented by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Nirmala Sitharaman, on July 23.The US-India Tax Forum has around 350 member companies and is a leading platform that allows Indian policymakers, global tax experts , and the business community to engage and advocate for a tax environment that is conducive to making India an attractive investment destination.The Tax Forum said it was recently invited to present industry recommendations on Union Budget 2024-25 at the Ministry of Finance.The forum's recommendations focus largely on advocating for a stable and predictable tax environment, which it said is extremely imperative to boost investment sentiment across sectors.An investment-led growth strategy is essential to support India's economy. To achieve this, measures are needed to enhance the ease of doing business, rationalize the cost of doing business, and simplify tax rates and tariffs, it asserted.The simplification of the withholding tax regime is among the top asks of the Tax Forum. With increased adoption of technology and use of data analytics, the scope of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and Tax Collection at Source (TCS) provisions needs to be rationalized, it said.Tarun Bajaj, Chairperson of US-India Tax Forum and former Revenue Secretary, Government of India, said, ""The ensuing budget of the government is expected to build on the reforms previously implemented. It is expected to introduce targeted reforms in direct taxes and customs policies, aimed at enhancing India's economic partnerships globally.""Bajaj said that the industry should anticipate measures to streamline corporate tax structures and transactions, incentivize investments, and simplify customs procedures to facilitate smoother trade flows.""These initiatives are crucial for fostering a conducive business environment and strengthening bilateral economic ties, ensuring mutual prosperity and competitiveness in the global market.

As India seeks to capitalize on the China plus one strategy, it is imperative that the import of critical supply chain components is made cost-effective and the process of bringing goods into the country is streamlined.""Customs duty relaxations on the import of supplies which strengthen domestic capabilities are the need of the hour, which will not only improve domestic efficiencies but also add to India's competitiveness,"" said the Forum.The interim budget, tabled on February 1, took care of the financial needs of the intervening period until a government was formed after the Lok Sabha polls, after which a full budget was supposed to be presented by the new government in July.With this upcoming Budget Presentation on July 23, Sitharaman will surpass the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who as finance minister, presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964.

indiatimes.com,Guidebook to lighting up India’s renewable energy ambitions for upcoming Union Budget 2024,"

As India sets its eyes on being a global green energy giant and achieving an installed renewable energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will seek to take a host of measures in the upcoming Union Budget 2024 to accomplish the targets.As it stands, India is #4 globally in installed capacity, including large hydro, and in wind power capacity.In solar energy, it stands fifth among all nations. With the government’s focus on bringing down the cost of clean power, the total installed non-fossil fuel capacity increased 396 per cent in the last 8.5 years to stand at more than 201.75 GW, about 45.3 per cent of the country’s total capacity as of May.In the February 2024 Interim Budget, Sitharaman provided a small but meaningful boost to the green energy sector with the announcement of the PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana. As part of this scheme, India will incentivise installing solar rooftops in households and provide viability gap funding for harnessing offshore wind energy potential with an initial capacity of one gigawatt.Additionally, the government will mandate the phased blending of compressed biogas (CBG) in compressed natural gas (CNG) for transport and natural gas (PNG) for domestic purposes.India has officially made it clear: It is committed to leveraging transnational grid interconnections to harness solar energy efficiently.During its G20 Presidency, India underscored the importance of transnational grid interconnections in enhancing energy security, fostering economic growth, and facilitating universal energy access.This vision aligns with the theme of G20, ""Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"" or ""One-Earth, One-Family, One-Future,"" emphasizing international cooperation in energy planning, information sharing, research and development, and technical assistance to support renewable energy integration, read the official release.The Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government in the Budget will have to focus on the availability of key equipment for the sector. In the face of escalating copper prices, a key material in manufacturing power equipment, India's renewable energy sector is challenged with rising costs and budgeting challenges, industry sources told ET.Copper, crucial for manufacturing power equipment, has seen a price surge over recent months, influenced by heightened manufacturing activity in China and the US, alongside new US sanctions on Russian copper imports.The Reserve Bank of India's proposals on project financing may add as much as 1 percentage point to the borrowing costs of renewables projects, a top consultancy firm told Bloomberg, potentially causing a hike in wind and solar power prices in the country.A lack of trained manpower is proving to be a major bottleneck for Indian renewable energy companies that are struggling for new hires as they expand their capacities. Companies in distress claim that they are either forced to send executives overseas to be trained, hire expats or poach employees from existing players.The government is working on readying a 1 lakh-strong workforce skilled in the installation and management of solar panels to support its plan of helping 10 million homes run on solar energy.To power its ambitious dream of a Rs 20,000 crore National Green Hydrogen Mission, the government is aiming to develop a skilled workforce of about 6 lakh people over the next six years. This follows an analysis by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) to identify the need for skilled workers across the entire value chain till 2030. The study will form the basis for preparing a plan in consultation with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), a senior government official told ET.Industry players have suggested offering GST concessions for electric vehicles along with incentives like FAME 3.0 through Union Budget 2024. Some also said that there is a need to nurture the resale market for the EV industry.Providing financial incentives, such as tax breaks, and subsidies, for companies that invest in sustainable technologies and practices can help accelerate the adoption of green manufacturing practices, experts opined. They also said there is an increasing emphasis by businesses to ensure sustainable practices through their supply chains.Apart from the aforementioned measures, experts have suggested that FM Sitharaman can also indulge in promoting Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs) in the execution of solar projects.(with agency inputs)",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-guidebook-to-lighting-up-indias-renewable-energy-ambitions-for-upcoming-union-budget-2024/articleshow/111676905.cms

The new government's economic vision and management of the ""political theme"" will be among the key aspects to watch in the upcoming Union budget , a Japanese brokerage said on Thursday. The brokerage said the second half of the year will see ""muted returns"" on the equities front, and reiterated its year-end target of 24,860 points on Nifty, which is only about 3 per cent higher than the current levels.The fiscal glide path beyond FY26, when the government has committed to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.6 per cent, will also be a key theme to look at, Nomura 's India Economist Aurodeep Nandi told reporters.Reminding of the 100-day programmes of the new government prepared by various ministries ahead of the elections, Nandi said getting some idea of the economic vision of the new government will be a key area to watch.After the election setback, the ""political theme"" of the budget by the new government dependent on coalition partners will also be keenly watched, he said.Specifically, how the new government manages the demands from Bihar and Andhra Pradesh - the home base of allies Janata Dal and TDP, respectively - will be watched, Nandi said.The allies are making demands, Nandi said, adding that heeding to those can lead to more borrowing, more direct transfers to citizens and also higher spends on infrastructure in pockets.Amid growing concerns on higher social sector spends, Nandi reminded all about Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman 's recent statement on saturation levels being reached on that subject, and added that there is no fiscal risk on account of that.He said the government has over-delivered by reducing the fiscal deficit to 5.6 per cent in FY24 as against the budgeted 5.8 per cent, and also has the comfort of the record Rs 2.1 lakh crore of dividend from the RBI.The final budget can also opt for reducing the fiscal deficit marginally to 5 per cent from the interim budget target of 5.1 per cent, he said.Nandi said the government may also look at helping consumption in the economy, and pointed to recent reports suggesting a relook in income taxes.Additionally, the government's handling of the ""manufacturing theme"" will also be keenly watched, he said, adding that this can include increasing outlays and also expanding the production linked incentives scheme to electronic components.On the equity markets front, the brokerage's head of equity research Saion Mukherjee said narratives are driving the market at present and most investors are not too bothered by the concerns on valuations.The current rally is completely fuelled by domestic money, and the foreign investors are on the sidelines, he said, adding that higher IPO activity in the second half of the year can help.Higher IPO activity will reduce the valuations, he said, explaining that at present, a higher quantum of money is chasing limited set of options and as the options increase, it will go to other scrips and help get some sanity.The foreign investors are chasing newer themes like artificial intelligence and the surge in Japanese markets, it said.Mukherjee said the brokerage is overweight on financial stocks, capital goods and power, and underweight on auto and consumer discretionary sectors.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-economic-vision-of-new-govt-political-theme-key-aspects-to-watch-in-budget-says-nomura-report/articleshow/111664905.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: How Nirmala Sitharaman can lay the infra bricks for a Viksit Bharat by 2047,"

Budget Expectations: To achieve the target of being a 'Viskit Bharat by 2047,' there’s a checklist for Modi & Co's upcoming Union Budget including infrastructure creation to attract investments, job creation, reduction of logistics cost and enhance the ease of doing business.Notably, Sitharaman, in her previous budget, laid emphasis on capex push for infrastructure with record Rs 11.1 lakh crore allotted for the same, which was a 11 per cent increase over the FY24 budget.“In July, our government will present a detailed roadmap for our pursuit of Viksit Bharat,"" said the Finance Minister during the presentation of the Interim Budget. The last budget was a vote on account owing to the Lok Sabha elections, but nevertheless, the policy announcement showed some glimpses of the larger intent of the government to continue its focus on infrastructure development.This allocation constituted 3.4 per cent of India's projected GDP for 2024-25, up from 3.3 per cent in the previous year.The Centre has already boarded the train which is on the way to the 'Viksit Bharat @2047' station as it has started outlining its near, medium and long term goals with its target to become a developed economy by 2047, with a focus on electric mobility, digitisation of payments infrastructure and high-speed expressways, officials said to ET.With current emphasis on infrastructure development, it is essential to improve the pace of construction in the country. Pace of road construction in India is expected to witness a 7-10 per cent decline in 2024-25 with the daily construction estimated at 31 km per day as against 34 km per day in 2023-24 due to heightened challenges in execution, the CareEdge Ratings said in a recent report. This will result in the national highways construction to slow down to 11,100 km to 11,500 km in this financial year as against 12,350 km in FY 24.“As project complexities rise and timelines elongate, it is imperative to swiftly address bottlenecks thus ensuring seamless infrastructure development,” Maulesh Desai, director, CareEdge Ratings said.Recently, a rating agency ICRA said state-owned NHAI's targeted asset monetisation of road assets could fetch the government up to Rs 60,000 crore in the current fiscal year. In April 2024, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had released an indicative list of 33 road assets it plans to monetise in FY2025, through a mix of toll-operate-transfer (TOT) and sale to the NHAI's Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT).These assets are spread across 12 states, cumulatively spanning nearly 2,750 km and with an annual toll collection of Rs 4,931 crore.The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has raised Rs 40,314 crore through various modes of asset monetisation in financial year 2023-24, against the target of Rs 28,968 crore, a senior government official said on Tuesday. The ministry had raised Rs 15,968 crore through monetisation of 4 toll-operate-transfer (TOT) bundles, Rs 15,700 crore through Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) and Rs 8,646 crore through securitisation, the official told news agency PTI.Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has reiterated that road safety is top-most priority of the government. The aim is to reduce accident deaths by 50 per cent by 2030, as an increase in the number of road accidents and deaths results in socio-economic loss of 3.14 per cent to GDP.Road making companies should switch to using alternative fuel power construction equipment and save costs, according to Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari.For a country with a population of 1.4 billion, there is a requirement of pushing for a higher boost in the upcoming Budget. Industry lobby body Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) President Sanjiv Puri is looking at more hikes in India's planned capex spending in the upcoming Budget for this fiscal year with at least an increase of 25 per cent in Budget from the previous fiscal year, as it will boost the economy and strengthen competition.Talking on the same lines, another industry body Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) has urged the Finance Minister to continue its thrust on capex for physical, social and digital infrastructure in the upcoming Union Budget.""The capital expenditure outlay for FY25 should be increased by 25 percent over RE for FY24 to Rs 11.8 lakh crore,"" said FICCI.The government is exploring policy mechanisms to capture the increase in land value resulting from road projects, including auctioning exits at greenfield expressways and 'betterment' levy, as it looks to ramp up funding for infrastructure creation, a senior official told ET.In this regard, the roads ministry is studying global best practices on innovative ways of infrastructure financing, the official said, adding that a decision on which mechanism will be used will be taken after the new government takes charge.Apart from hiking capex and finding other alternate solutions to fund financing, the Finance Minister can take measures to increase the participation of the private sector and subsidise green technology to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.(with agency inputs)",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-how-nirmala-sitharaman-can-lay-the-infra-bricks-for-a-viksit-bharat-by-2047/articleshow/111649833.cms

The government needs to take steps such as reviewing personal income tax slabs in the upcoming Union Budget to drive private consumption , which in turn will drive private investment , Godrej & Boyce Executive Director & CEO, Anil G Verma said on Thursday. He also expressed optimism that the government will build upon the solid foundation laid by the interim budget, which focused on boosting infrastructure development, maintaining fiscal prudence, and laid progressive emphasis on women, youth, farmers, and the underprivileged through skilling, welfare measures and financial assistance.""The important area that needs to be addressed now, amongst others, is the continued lower-than-expected growth in private consumption,"" Verma said in a statement.Asserting that private consumption drives private investment, he said, ""Therefore, I am hopeful that the GoI (government of India) will take steps that boost consumption through a slew of measures that could include optimising GST rates , reviewing of personal income tax slabs and reassessment of the interest rates to provide EMI relief to the large masses whose purchases of assets such as homes and consumer durables are through loans.""These steps will not only provide tailwinds to the consumer durables industry but also have a multiplier effect on the industries that serve them, through increased capacity utilisation and hence also pave the way for private investments to flow in at a faster pace, Verma said.Looking ahead, he said, ""I hope that the upcoming budget continues to prioritise these areas while also introducing policies that promote innovation, production-linked incentives (PLIs), and sustainable practices.These measures are crucial for driving holistic economic growth and ensuring balanced and inclusive development for India.""Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the full budget for 2024-25 on July 23.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-needs-to-take-steps-to-address-lower-than-expected-growth-in-consumption-godrej-boyce-ceo/articleshow/111659602.cms

Budget 2024 expectations : All eyes are on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will present the Union Budget 2024 , on July 23. The logistics sector is especially hopeful, given the Rs 11 lakh crore boost allocated by the Interim Budget in February, by way of three major economic railway corridor programmes, including energy, mineral and cement corridors, port connectivity corridors, and high-traffic density corridors, under the PM Gati Shakti scheme .Looking ahead, we perceive the upcoming budget presenting a unique opportunity to balance the nation’s economic growth priorities with fiscal consolidation.To sustain the growth momentum of the logistics sector, prioritising capital expenditure in key infrastructure projects, alongside financial incentives such as PLI, tax benefits and subsidies are crucial as these will help drive innovation in logistics. Further, establishing a ‘One India’ logistics ecosystem and integrating initiatives such as the National Logistics Policy and Sagarmala Project are crucial in terms of enhancing India’s ranking on the global Logistics Performance Index. To reinforce India’s potential as a manufacturing powerhouse, the budget must focus on domestic manufacturing, and on preparing the logistics sector for service integration, growth in fulfilment logistics and multi-modal transportation adoption. The government should also consider automation investments, especially in technologically advanced warehouses, which can position India as a logistics innovation leader.We anticipate a stronger push for the EV industry, in the form of tax incentives, charging infrastructure subsidies and financial support for R&D. Establishing a holistic regulatory framework for last-mile delivery and formal recognition of the gig workforce under labour laws are essential to ensure fair employment practices in today’s digital economy.The logistics industry is a crucial driver of economic efficiency, and we are hopeful for the budget to include transformative measures that will drive innovation and inclusivity in the sector. We urge the government to address the logistics sector’s unique needs by enhancing the strategic allocations towardinfrastructure development , tax reforms and other governance policies. Besides this, a renewed focus on setting up digitally advanced processes with the use of cutting-edge technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT, and big data will streamline efficiency.We hope the government will consider the inclusion of diesel under the GST ambit as this is a critical move in enabling India to reduce its logistics costs and become more competitive in the international market. It will also help key logistics players to regulate costs by cutting down on tax outflows.As we await the release of the Interim Budget, the logistics sector is primed for transformative measures that will fuel our nation’s journey to a USD 5 trillion economy. The forthcoming budget presents a significant opportunity to reinforce our commitment to enhancing the ease of doing business with India. India’s logistics costs, as highlighted by DPIIT, are encouraging; but our gaze must look beyond mere cost considerations. A strategic allocation of resources towards infrastructure, competence and traceability is essential for sustained progress.A sustained focus on and adopting a long-term perspective towards building key physical and digital infrastructure, incentivising multimodal logistics for carbon reduction, and robust skilling initiatives for the 22 million individuals employed in the sector should be the key priorities for the upcoming budget. To boost EXIM trade and improve competitiveness, we must maintain the momentum in investments and digitalisation. This approach will empower India to progress rapidly towards a more resilient and sustainable transport and logistics ecosystem.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-expectations-strategic-interventions-and-an-innovation-first-approach-will-drive-growth-for-indian-logistics/articleshow/111663402.cms

The targeted tax relief got bigger with time

Taxpayers expect the expired tax benefits to be back with enhanced limit

While the interim Budget (presented on Feb 1, 2024) provided some respite to taxpayers by waiving some limited outstanding demands for the past years up to FY 2015-16, it did not provide any specific tax relief to taxpayers. Hence, all eyes are on the upcoming Union Budget 2024 to be announced in July 2024.India's current real estate sector is experiencing a mix of challenges and opportunities. One of the major opportunities in the same is the growing demand for affordable housing , driven by government initiatives such as PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) and urbanisation trends.Also read: What homeowners want from Budget 2024 The government introduced the benefit of mortgage interest deduction for first-time residential home buyers under Section 80EE of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (""the Act"") in FY 2016-17. The benefit under Section 80EE is limited to deduction of interest paid of INR 50,000, for any loan sanctioned from a financial institution between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017. Further, the value of such residential house-property should not exceed INR 50 Lakhs and the amount of loan sanctioned for such residential property should not exceed INR 35 Lakhs. Deduction can be claimed till the repayment of loan and the deduction for the same interest cannot be claimed under any other section of the Act.In Finance Act 2019, under its objective of 'Housing for All"", the government extended the deduction for mortgage interest paid on low-cost housing loans taken during the period between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, through a newly introduced section 80EEA. The benefit under Section 80EEA is limited to deduction of interest paid of INR 150,000 for any loan sanctioned from a financial institution between the said period. As in the case of Section 80EE, the benefit under Section 80EEA is also limited to first-time residential home buyers only. While there is no limit on the amount of loan sanctioned by a financial institution, the stamp duty value of such residential house property, however, should not exceed INR 45 Lakh.Since numerous assessees claimed the said deduction, it was a success and consequently the government extended the last day of loan sanction from 31 March 2020 to 31 March 2022 in the Finance Act 2021 such that more individuals could take benefit of the same.Due to the above deductions, along with other deductions such as for mortgage interest payment and principal repayment under Section 24 and Section 80C of the Act respectively, taxpayers have substantial opportunities to optimise their tax liabilities specifically for the expenditure on purchase of residential property.Also read: How Budget 2024 could simplify capital gains tax While the time limit for borrowing to qualify for deduction under this section has been exhausted, taxpayers have high expectations from the upcoming Union Budget, considering that this will be the first Budget by the government in their third term. The government may plan to reintroduce this benefit under Section 80EEA to claim deduction of interest paid for any loan sanctioned from a financial institution up to 31 March 2026, such that more individuals can avail the benefit of the 'affordable housing' scheme and thus, purchase their own property and avail tax benefits in return.To increase the demand for affordable housing, the government may consider raising the limit of the stamp duty value of the property from INR 45 Lakh, as this would expand the benefits for home buyers and boost end user demand. Further, while setting the limit for the same, the rising cost of property should be considered, to ensure equitable benefit to all.Further, while the said deduction is only available as of now in the old tax regime, it should be introduced in the new tax regime as well, such that a universal benefit of purchase of affordable housing be provided to all individuals regardless of income levels.The nation awaits the announcement of Union Budget 2024 with great anticipation, eager for potential reforms and incentives that could profoundly influence the economic landscape in the year ahead.(The author is Director with Deloitte India.)",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/affordable-housing-tax-relief-budget-2024-expected-to-bring-back-deduction-on-home-loan-interest-payment-other-measures/articleshow/111662397.cms
indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: Import duty on renewable sector components a double-edged sword, need gradual transition, say experts","The Interim Budget 2024-25 gave a small but meaningful push for the green energy sector with the announcement of the PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana . Experts say they are hoping the Union Budget will give more consideration for the green industry.Ajay Shankar, Distinguished Fellow, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), cited the Prime Minister’s announcement in Glasgow at COP26 that India would have 500GW of fossil fuel-free energy generation capacity by 2030. “Most of this capacity has to come from renewables, and renewables now need storage. An announcement of a steep rise in annual capacity addition of renewables along with storage and ensuring provision of necessary green finance for this purpose would send the right signals,” he said.This will help to address the challenge of integrating intermittent renewable energy sources into the grid.Apart from this, he pointed out that the budget should also make an announcement that India will become self-reliant in the production of solar panels and green hydrogen in five years. That would indicate the government's seriousness in achieving a breakthrough in the make in India initiative. Import duties and financial support should be fine-tuned to achieve this and a road map to achieve self-reliance should be announced.Another important step that can create an enabling environment for the green energy sector would be policy stability. Gautam Mohanka , CEO, Gautam Solar, said that for investors and project developers, policy stability has always been crucial. “As solar projects require huge investments and can take 2 or more years, investors need the confidence that there will not be any sudden policy shifts. Hence, policy stability and development of grid infrastructure are key areas for investors and developers. As a leading solar panel manufacturer catering to large projects, our hope is that the government will continue to back domestic manufacturing like it has so far with ALMM and BCD on solar module imports,” he said.One of the biggest challenges in the solar industry remains the negligible production of solar cells and wafers in the country. A PLI scheme that provides capital subsidy support to mid-sized manufacturers of solar cells and wafers will help in establishing the entire supply chain of solar module manufacturing in the country. Mohanka said that Indian manufacturers still heavily rely on Chinese suppliers for these raw materials.In fact, while the annual solar panel manufacturing capacity in the country was 64.5 GW by the end of 2023, the capacity of solar cell manufacturing was limited to 5.8 GW.“The major reason for this is the complex and capital intensive process. Indian manufacturers already face financing hurdles, paying 3 to 4 times higher interest rates than their Chinese counterparts. In recent times, a small number of large conglomerates have been able to start this manufacturing through the PLI scheme. So, the government can take out a PLI scheme for mid-sized manufacturers so that there are no monopoly concerns, especially as many projects now require panels meeting DCR requirements,” he said.He acknowledged that there has been some concern around import duty on solar components. The import duty on solar modules has been set at 40% and that for solar cells at 25%. “The government can consider cutting down the import duty on solar cells from 25% to maybe 15% till the indigenous solar cell production capacity grows to meet the requirements. This will reduce the cost overheads for domestic manufacturers, helping Indian solar panels to be more cost-competitive with Chinese panels,” he said.Adding to this, Manish Dabkara, Chairman & MD of EKI Energy Services Ltd, said the high import duties act as a double-edged sword for the industry. Increased costs for imported solar modules and cells have slowed down renewable energy adoption due to less project viability. On the other hand, domestic manufacturing capacity isn't yet sufficient to meet the demand, leading to project delays. The transition should be gradual, he said.He explained that a phased reduction of import duties could provide time for domestic manufacturers to become more competitive. “Focusing on PLIs and other benefits for domestic manufacturers can encourage local production, ultimately reducing reliance on imports and fostering a more sustainable renewable energy industry. The upcoming budget should bring catalysts to phased reduction in import duties over a set timeframe, would provide immediate relief to project developers and allow domestic manufacturers time to scale up production. A tiered duty structure will incentivise domestic production of readily available technologies while ensuring access to advanced components for grid modernisation through lower duties or exemptions,” he said.The government can promote long-term domestic capacity building without solely relying on import duty manipulation. The ideal approach should strike a balance between project cost competitiveness, domestic manufacturing incentives and technological advancement, he said.Among other expectations, Dabkara said that the industry wants innovative financing solutions to bridge the gap between project costs and tariffs. This could involve green bonds, infrastructure investment trusts or easier access to loans for renewable energy projects.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sustainability/budget-2024-import-duty-on-renewable-sector-components-a-double-edged-sword-need-gradual-transition-say-experts/articleshow/111650643.cms
indiatimes.com,Income tax cut in Union Budget 2024: India’s middle-class is asking for it but may not get it,"BUDGET: What do the taxpayers want, and what have they got so far



Budget 2024: Time to temper tax cut expectations?



UNION BUDGET: No need for Modi govt to cut taxes?



Taxes needed for a Viksit Bharat?





NEW DELHI: Budget announcements and tax cut dreams are constant year after year, but if historical precedent is anything to go by, so are disappointments. Once again, voices from India’s middle class for a tax cut in a highly inflationary environment have increased.This time around, it is not just the aam aadmi, but also India Inc that has called for some tax relief at the individual level. Prominent industry representatives have suggested that income tax relief for those in the lowest slab may need to be considered by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman come July 23 when she announces the full Budget for this financial year.A relief in income tax rates could help boost India’s slacking consumption levels which could in turn boost companies’ profit levels and eventually the overall economy.Expectations of a tax slab rejig also received a boost following the BJP’s lesser-than-expected seat win in the general elections, and the upcoming Assembly elections in key states like Maharashtra.The general consensus among taxpayers remains that apart from a blanket cut in tax rates, the exemption level in Section 80C should go up, given the inflation rates in India.While the existing tax regime has been left undisturbed, the Centre announced a brand new tax structure in 2020 wherein the calculations were simplified and most exemptions were eliminated. In 2021, there were no income tax reliefs, and the story remained the same in 2022.In 2023, the government made the new income tax regime the default option, with the basic exemption limit hiked to Rs 3 lakh from 2.5 lakh and the slabs in the new regime were shuffled.In this regime, as it stands, there is no tax on those earning up to Rs 3 lakh. Income above Rs 3 lakh and up to Rs 5 lakh, will be taxed at 5 per cent with a rebate eligibility. For income of above Rs 6 lakh and up to Rs 9 lakh, the income tax is applicable at a 10 per cent rate. For income of more than Rs 12 lakh and up to Rs 15 lakh, income is taxed at a 20 per cent rate. For those who have a taxable income of above Rs 15 lakh, a 30 per cent income tax rate is applicable.News reports have suggested that the Finance Ministry in its stakeholder meetings mulled tax measures like cutting rates or adding a new slab as it seeks to push consumption, with specific focus on India’s lower-income individuals.Officials have likely discussed making changes to the new tax regime which was announced in 2020, wherein income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at 5-20 per cent while earnings over Rs 15 lakh is taxed at 30 per cent, news agency Reuters reported.However, economists feel the government may not be inclined to give tax benefits at this stage, given its focus on fiscal prudence.“The central government is likely to stick to its path of fiscal consolidation in the upcoming Budget. The focus is likely to remain on growth through targeted expenditure on schemes and policies which will lead to more employment and income generation,” Aditi Gupta, economist, Bank of Baroda told ETOnline.Murmurs of tax sops have gathered pace, given the Bharatiya Janata Party's below-expectations performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and the upcoming Assembly Elections in some key states.""We do not expect any big sops in the Budget. There might be targeted policies addressing sector-specific stress, especially on the rural side. State governments are more likely to come up with policies which could be deemed populist in the run-up to the elections,"" Gupta said.One argument behind seeking a tax rate cut is that it could spur India’s lagging consumption by putting more money in the hands of the average taxpayer which they would spend and eventually lead to a boost in the economy.However, Gupta says that this argument may be flawed.“The rationale that lower taxes would spur consumption might be flawed. This is because the slack in consumption demand in India is largely led by the rural sector. Indicators for urban demand continue to show steady progress, and as such providing tax incentives which will majorly accrue to the organised sector workers, is unlikely to have the desired outcome on consumption,” Gupta said.Economists have pointed out the skewed consumption patterns in India in recent years, with the rich spending more and the poor spending less.According to analysts, rural demand, which was subdued in FY24 because of persistent inflation and consumer spending constraints, has been slowly rebounding as companies reduce prices of their products. However, this rebound has not recouped fully.Tax collection has remained an important priority of the Narendra Modi government, as it would need the stability to fund India’s schemes.“To finance the infrastructure requirement of a developing country like India, the government needs to have a strong and stable tax base. Since coming into power, the government has focussed on reducing tax leakages from the system by bringing in timely tax reforms in the country,” Gupta said.Analysts expect the Centre to continue with its focus on capital expenditure in this Budget as well, which could eventually benefit India’s middle-class.“If the previous budgets are any indicator, the government is more focused towards infrastructure developments, etc. The schemes could be further in the direction of taking India to the podium amongst world economies which in turn would benefit the common man,” Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director, Deloitte India told ET Online.In a positive development earlier this fiscal, the Reserve Bank of India transferred a surplus of Rs 2.11 lakh crore to the Centre as dividend. Economists opined this gives the government enough cushion to mull welfare spending whilst maintaining its focus on fiscal prudence.Centre wants to bring down India’s fiscal deficit, the gap between the government’s incomes and receipts, to 5.1 per cent of GDP in FY25 and 4.5 per cent in FY26.The arguments put forth by India’s middle class is that the tax rates are high in comparison to other developed nations thereby reducing the net disposable income. There are limited deductions/exemptions available for salaried classes specifically considering the rising inflation.“While these could come across as fair concerns of middle-class India, from the government’s perspective, striking a balance between generating revenue and keeping taxes fair for the middle class is a constant challenge,” Viswanathan said.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/union-budget-tax-relief-expectations-budget-2024-lower-gst-tax-cut-middle-class-is-asking-for-it-but-may-not-get-it/articleshow/111653896.cms

Budget 2024 expectations : India has shown remarkable progress in the field of health and nutrition. Presently, over 50 crore Indians benefit from the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), ensuring their access to healthcare. The country has established 1.73 lakh Ayushman Aarogya Mandirs (AAMs) to offer comprehensive primary healthcare services.Over the past decade, the number of medical education seats for both under- and post-graduate programmes has more than doubled. Moreover, the out-of-pocket health expenditure has decreased from 63% in 2014 to 39% in 2024.Nevertheless, India still has a considerable distance to cover in comparison to global standards as it aims for Viksit Bharat @ 2047. The current life expectancy in India stands at 71 years, whereas it is 77 in China, 84 in Japan, and 75 in Brazil. India's Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is 28 per 1000 live births, contrasting with 5 in China and less than 2 in Japan. South Africa's out-of-pocket health expenditure accounts for only about 8% of the total, in contrast to India's 39%.Also See: India Union Budget 2024 Presently, there are 10 doctors and 17 nurses and midwives per 10,000 individuals in India. In comparison, middle-income countries like China and Brazil have 17 doctors and 40 nurses and midwives per 10,000 persons, while high-income countries like the US and Australia have 39 doctors and 120 nurses and midwives per 10,000 individuals.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 3 steps Modi government should consider for employment generation Countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea have demonstrated the potential of harnessing the demographic dividend to achieve remarkable economic growth through the implementation of progressive policies and initiatives aimed at empowering the youth in making informed health choices. The allocation of adequate funds for the health sector in the Union Budget 2024-25 is of utmost importance. According to theNational Health Policy (NHP) 2017, India's healthcare expenditure should reach 2.5% of GDP by 2024-25.Notably, public healthcare spending in India encompasses health, family welfare, AYUSH, medical research, and water supply and sanitation. While some states have exceeded the 8% target outlined in the NHP 2017, others fall short, highlighting disparities in healthcare expenditure across states. Therefore, the central government plays a crucial role in augmenting state health expenditure to promote greater equity nationwide. Increased funding for nutrition, clean drinking water, and sanitation is also critical. The Budget 2024-25 should prioritize efforts to eradicate childhood undernutrition and anaemia among women and children.Also See: Budget Income Tax Slabs 2024 It is vital to increase investment in the health of children and adolescents, with a particular focus on early childhood development, care, and education for children aged 0–6 years. The first 1000 days of life, from a woman’s pregnancy to her child’s second birthday, present a unique opportunity to establish the foundation for lifelong health and development. Adequate nutrition and care during this period not only impact a child’s survival but also her ability to thrive, learn, and break the cycle of poverty. Strengthening the existing 14 lakh Anganwadi Centers and providing adequate training to staff in child development and learning, could have a significant impact.Also Read | Budget 2024: 7 structural reforms FM Nirmala Sitharaman should target for sustainable growth One crucial aspect to consider is the health of students in schools. The school-age phase is a key time for the body to start storing nutrients, which aids in rapid growth. Focusing on school children is essential for India to harness the potential of its young population, who will play a vital role in the future workforce and contribute to improving the nation's socio-economic status.Introducing a nationwide school health initiative can ensure the overall well-being of 255 million school children and teenagers aged 6-18, with a focus on physical and mental health, nutrition, wellness, and promoting a healthy lifestyle. Creating a school environment that encourages health and nutrition through activities such as yoga, physical education, mental health support, counselling, and regular health check-ups should be a top priority.The healthcare system's foundation is rooted in primary healthcare, which is essential for achieving the desired health outcomes by 2047. The future well-being of citizens depends heavily on the efficient delivery of services through our AAMs. Therefore, the transformation of all AAMs must be completed by 2027. Since 2018, the primary healthcare platform has been established with 173,000 AAMs, along with the deployment of community health officers, infrastructure upgrades, telemedicine services, and provision of free drugs and diagnostics.However, challenges related to full operationalization, coverage, quality, and continuity persist across states. The implementation of half of the package focusing on mental health, acute care, geriatric care, oral, visual, and ENT treatments, and emergency services needs to be improved. The other half of the package, which has been implemented, faces challenges with the inconsistent availability of medications and diagnostics at some AAMs. Although screenings for hypertension and diabetes have commenced, the emphasis also needs to be on treatment, follow-ups, and other services. Furthermore, cancer screening rates need to be improved, as does the training of personnel in critical areas.Research indicates that improved health outcomes contribute to enhanced economic productivity. It is essential that Budget 2024-25 is a transformational step towards securing additional funding for healthcare, alongside enhancing the quality of health services with the existing resources.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2024-how-to-lay-the-foundation-for-a-healthy-india-by-2047/articleshow/111654217.cms

Allocating a robust amount to bolster military capabilities has emerged as a pivotal strategy for governments seeking to fortify their defences against foreign powers. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget on July 23 and experts predict a higher allocation for the defence sector in the upcoming budget, continuing the trend of previous years.For India, the focus seems to have shifted from the early Independence decades, wherein most of the focus was on our neighbour Pakistan. But now, as India grows in stature and power, China has emerged as a formidable country and a neighbour that India has had a few skirmishes. To step up the defences, India's strategy must focus on keeping China at bay.China’s adventures with the littorals of the South China Sea hint at preparedness on the part of India considering the world conflict scenario, says Dr Amit Singh Associate Professor, Special Centre for National Security Studies, JNU. All the more when Chinese manoeuvring at the LAC and LOC poses challenges for India's defence sector to defend its territorial integrity, he says.“India’s defence budget is expected to cater to the rapidly changing geo-political scenarios at the global stage instantaneously. India may tackle some of these security challenges by increasing the defence budget significantly,” he adds.We take a look at how India’s defence budget compares to that of China’s.For any analysis of China's military spending, it's in order to begin with a disclaimer — the numbers issued by the Chinese government and as such, must be taken with a grain of salt.China in March announced its defence budget for 2024 and interestingly maintained the growth rate of its military expenditure at precisely the same percentage as last year, as Chairman Xi Jinping continues to prioritize the People's Liberation Army (PLA) at the expense of other sectors of government funding.China’s defence budget for 2024 will rise 7.2 per cent to Chinese Yuan (CNY) 1.66554 trillion, which equates to USD 231.4 billion.As a proportion of GDP, China’s core defence budget amounted to 1.25 per cent, well below the global average of 1.8 per cent and the 2 per cent target for NATO countries, according to a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).Putting China's spending in proper regional perspective, it is twelve times that of Taiwan's and four times as much as Japan's defence expenditure.Despite the economic slowdown of China, the country has doubled its defence expenditure since 2015, says Dr Singh. “In the Interim budget 2024-25, the Modi government allocated approx $75 billion which is not sufficient given the threat perception faced by India from China,” he adds.Sitharaman disclosed the allocation of a staggering Rs 6.21 lakh crore for India's Ministry of Defence during the Interim Budget presentation in February. This marked a 4.3 per cent increase from the previous year, constituting a substantial portion of the Union Budget at 13.04 per cent.The Union Budget is expected to be an extension of the Interim Budget itself, as per experts.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in October 2023 said that India needs stronger armed forces with modern equipment in order to become a developed country by 2047 when we celebrate 100 years of Independence.At present, Modi 3.0 is loading and the defence sector is expecting that the government should spend at least 25 per cent of the central government’s total expenditure every year, Dr Singh says. “Consequently, India can ‘handle’ the threat perception at the LAC/LOC and their neighbourhood.”Going by the threat perception faced by India from China and Pakistan including the current geopolitical scenario, Dr Singh says India should spend at least 25 per cent of the central government’s total expenditure in the coming budget.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/budget-2024-india-trails-china-in-defence-spending-but-must-fill-the-insufficient-allocation/articleshow/111662877.cms

Budget 2024 expectations : As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Union Budget this month, the Modi 3.0 government aims to bolster the Indian economy with a keen focus on infrastructure. A critical component of this infrastructure is the power sector, where power exchanges can play a transformative role in enhancing efficiency, transparency, and competitive price discovery.Power exchanges are pivotal in India's power sector, offering over 25 contracts across various market segments and trading more than 120 billion units (BUs) annually. Despite this, power exchanges account for only about 7% of the country's total power generation, a stark contrast to European countries where over 50% of generation is traded through exchanges. This discrepancy underscores the significant growth potential for India's power exchanges.Recognizing the importance of a robust power market, the government’s Draft National Electricity Policy aims to increase the share of spot markets to 25% by 2030. This policy aligns with India's commitment to reducing the emission intensity of its GDP by 45% from 2005 levels and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. To support these goals, the government plans to have 50% of installed generation capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030, necessitating around 500 GW ofrenewable energy (RE) capacity.The integration of renewable energy (RE) into India's grid can be significantly accelerated through power exchanges. Renewable sources often exhibit variability and intermittent generation, posing challenges for forecasting. Power exchanges offer solutions such as the Day Ahead Market (DAM) and Real Time Market (RTM), which provide flexible trading options to manage these fluctuations effectively.International examples illustrate how power exchanges can reduce renewable integration costs and offer efficient price signals. A Deloitte study highlights that market-based RE projects can achieve higher internal rates of return (IRR) compared to Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)-based projects. This approach addresses issues like signing delays, timely payments, and avoiding disputes.The Ministry of Power’s report on the ""Development of Electricity Market in India"" also advocates for a larger role for power exchanges, citing the inefficiencies of long-term PPAs. The report suggests models such as Contracts for Difference (CfD) and Virtual PPAs, which have been successful in countries like the UK and Germany.The future of renewable energy integration hinges on grid-level energy storage. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are poised to drive sector growth, offering cost-effective 24/7 renewable power. Recent tenders have shown significant tariff reductions, making BESS a promising solution for rapid decarbonization.The establishment of a Capacity Market is a key anticipated change, aimed at bridging power generation with national demand and determining optimal energy mixes. Additionally, the government's push for Green Hydrogen and Rooftop Solar projects is setting the stage for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading, which will revolutionize power consumption in India.Power exchanges have consistently delivered lower prices compared to other procurement methods over the past 15 years. As India advances towards energy banking solutions, energy storage, and green hydrogen, new products on power exchanges will be crucial in meeting the country's future energy demands. The Union Budget 2024 presents a pivotal opportunity to harness the potential of power exchanges, driving India towards a sustainable and efficient energy future.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2024-power-exchanges-as-catalysts-for-indias-energy-future/articleshow/111631629.cms

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: Agriculture & FMCG sectors seek better infra & tech to help farmers tackle climate change, inflationary pressures","The agriculture and FMCG sectors have requested the government to use the budget to address the challenges they face due to drought, climate change and inflationary pressures.The requests were made during pre-budget consultations with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman . The minister is scheduled to present the Union Budget on July 23, after presenting an interim budget in February due to Lok Sabha elections.Ashok Kumar, Associate Director, Farm Prosperity, Transform Rural India (TRI), tells ET Digital that a robust crop insurance mechanism is of paramount importance for farmers as weather risks have emerged as a major threat due to climate change. The budget should also focus on safe food production practices and support the production of chemical-free products that are safe for consumption. “Value addition and procurement have to be facilitated near farms. That will lead to higher income. Investment should be announced in quality energy access in farms and processing of primary agriculture produce. Photovoltaic systems could be a potential solution to meet the energy requirement of the agri sector,” says Kumar.Rajesh Aggarwal, Managing Director, Insecticides (India), says the agricultural sector eagerly awaits increased investment in rural infrastructure. Other comprehensive reforms that are important are the strengthening of road networks, irrigation facilities and storage infrastructure. “These are pivotal to minimise post-harvest losses and enhance market access for farmers. This initiative not only intensifies productivity but also generates employment, catalysing rural economies. Collaborative efforts between the government and private sector are imperative, facilitating the integration of advanced technologies and efficient farming practices. Enhanced supply chain management, supported by public-private partnerships, ensures streamlined operations and accessibility to quality agricultural inputs, including crop protection products like insecticides and biologicals,” says Aggarwal.The budget must prioritise funding for climate-smart agriculture so as to promote innovations like solar-powered irrigation and rainwater harvesting, say industry experts and stakeholders.Industry representatives of FMCG companies that are dependent on agriculture remain optimistic and anticipate a more stable market in 2024.Manish Aggarwal, Director, Bikano, Bikanervala Foods , says that there is a need for schemes to boost rural consumption, fostering a stable market in 2024. “We also anticipate policies to protect oilseed farmers and the oleochemical industry. Additionally, we expect the government's focus on capital expenditure and private sector manufacturing and services to drive income generation and economic activity. Increasing funding for the agriculture accelerator fund is crucial to improve farming practices through new technology and better storage solutions.""Notably, India’s agricultural exports reached $53 billion in FY2023, up nearly 6% from FY2022. Rice, marine products and sugar are the top three contributors. However, in the recent past there have been many challenges in agricultural exports such as the produce not meeting the minimum residue level (MRL), says Anand Ramanathan, Partner and Consumer Products and Retail Sector Leader, Deloitte India. “Efficient policies & strong government support is required to tap into the larger agriculture exports market.”Most farmer producer organisations (FPOs) are either inactive or unable to succeed, majorly due to weak management of operations and finances. It is important to bring in measures for capacity development to ensure longevity of the FPOs to ensure continued benefits to farmer members, he says.There is also a need for the government to focus on increasing awareness about the benefits of technology in agriculture, while also focusing on improving adoption and scale of these solutions through appropriate incentives. India has the most arable land in the world, at 157 million hectares (2021), and is one of the largest producers of agricultural products globally, with a gross agricultural output (GAO) of $480 billion in FY22. India is the largest producer of pulses and fruits and the second-largest producer of rice and milk in FY22. However, it lags in processing.“The current processing level is estimated to be around 10%, significantly lower than developed nations, which exceed 50%. The Indian government recognises this potential and has launched initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana to boost infrastructure, provide financial assistance and promote food parks. The focus now needs to move towards micro-processing clusters and to ensure value transfer to farmers,” says Ramanathan.Every year, around 16% of fruits and vegetables, 10% of oilseeds, 9% of pulses and 6% of grains are lost after harvest primarily due to inadequate storage conditions. To reduce these losses, there should be an ample number of steel silos and warehouses equipped with modern sensors and monitoring systems. “A network of micro-cold storage facilities should be established in addition to packhouses to help decrease fruit and vegetable loss on farms and give farmers an extended selling window and prevent distress selling,” says Ramanathan.India is the leading producer of milk globally, contributing about a fourth to the world's production. The country saw a 58% increase in milk output from 2014-15 to 2022-23. Despite this growth, low productivity per animal remains a challenge, particularly for small farmers. “To address this, it is essential to resolve issues such as feed and fodder scarcity, poor sanitation and veterinary care, high input costs, and inefficient marketing channels for farms outside cooperative networks,” notes Ramanathan.Aggarwal of Bikano, Bikanervala Foods, agrees that better infrastructure facilitates market access, reduces transportation costs, and enhances the quality of life, making it easier for FMCG companies to reach rural consumers.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-agriculture-fmcg-sectors-seek-better-infra-tech-to-help-farmers-tackle-climate-change-inflationary-pressures/articleshow/111623558.cms

Market optimism is built on five core pillars of expectations - Economic growth , corporate earnings trajectory, investor sentiment, monetary policy outlook and market momentum.These factors often interact and reinforce each other, creating a positive feedback loop that can drive market optimism. We are in a period where almost each of these has become steadily positive.While the market did react sharply to a scare of discontinuity against single-party-majority system which we witnessed for the last decade, it soon corrected upon assessing the construct of the new coalition and the structure of cabinet which clearly drives on a dominant thread of continuity in the core ministerial council and portfolios – giving market a comfort on no possible diversion from the expected policy path when it comes to economy and capital markets High retail interest and sufficient cash ratio in domestic institutions also has been a reason for this optimism.We are all in a world that is volatile and uncertain – be it economic, politics (elections) and conflicts (there is one new every quarter), mixed growth, stubborn supply-driven inflation and the changing dynamics on central bank responses in terms of rate policies.Add to these, the noise on AI and its rub off on business model canvass, technology life cycle and impending job losses. The two most important global events are the outcome of the US Elections and the much sought-after FED rate cut (extent and number).Back home, the events to watch out are Union Budget 2024-25 – which would be the first from the new regime – that will set the tone of expectations, progress and dispersion of monsoon and RBI policy nuggets on following/preceding the global rate-cut cycle, if any.One must also remain alert to a paradox where the market delivers a high single digit return in a quarter where BSE500 quarterly PAT growth (YoY) stands at 11% in March-24, the lowest since Dec-22 (5%).Moreover, the % of companies with PAT growth <0 has been rising over the past two quarters and currently stands at 33%, however the same is still below 5-year average of 37%.The retail investor of today is better informed, educated and even better armoured with ammunitions on how to navigate markets with a geeky framework that navigates loads of data and information.Improved financial literacy too has played its part – and not to forget the in-built youthfulness, aggressive approach, and an aspirational mindset. Hordes of easy-access self-help material, subscription-based media, along with low-cost broking platforms are supporting decisions of these investors.We do not operate in the retail investment space. By design we are long term, low-churn, focused equity investors – servicing the wealth needs of UHNIs.There relationship with money is more evolved, expectations from the market are rational and they are far better informed.We are in a zone where the yearly result is just out. The busy season is far away and yet to set-in. Generally, earnings expectations do not change during these periods.One will see more serious earnings revisions post the current results season, based on the outlook and management commentary on demand, updates on key commodities, and further developments on the policy front in terms of visible government commitments to kick start new capex cycle and elevating the bottom-of-the-pyramid economic vitality.Earnings upgrades are only one part of the equation when it comes to market performance. Liquidity and sentiments are the other two. Unless being subject to unforeseen global external events, we do not see either of them under threat with sustained retail flow commitments through DIIs, relatively lighter weightages and under-ownerships of FIIs and the recency bias of the asset class performance weighing in on the expectations in short/medium term.Over the years with the formation of GST council and persistent vigil on economic progress, importance of annual budget has diminished.On this background, The Union budget 2024-25 is significant being the first from new regime. The focus will be on taking the unfinished agenda and fast tracking some of the pending reforms.One can expect special focus to boost the income opportunities at the bottom of the pyramid, rationalization of taxes, driving capex cycle (public and private) while maintaining the balance on twin deficits.One can expect a special focus on sectors that can support self-dependency through import substitution and cater large domestic market.FIIs have been a vital cog in the India story through the last 3-decades. However, the onset of a large domestic savings pool seeking superior long-term returns with committed monthly flows into the DIIs (MFs, plus insurance) have diminished their influence on the market direction in general.For FIIs, India is one of the markets while the domestic investors are here to stay with strong stickiness. Equities continue to be a preferred asset class by savers – riding a megatrend of sustained financialization on the back of rising penetration, sustained market buoyancy, heightened retail interest, expanding base of new & early investors, and growing financial literacy.A continued trickle of domestic flows witnessed since Covid aftermath have provided for a sustained cushion against volatile foreign flows, resulting in lower drawdowns during corrections and delivering a lower volatility.These factors have accounted for a sustained higher multiple for India equities. FIIs flows are slaves of relative opportunity in terms of valuation multiples, growth return profiles and liquidity backed opportunities in a market.India is an emerging market with a near-developed-market architecture in terms of its DNA of equality, legal enforcement, digital readiness, educated mass. India historically has got grouped with CHINA for comparisons and most of the time has got a second-fiddle treatment.With the last four years performance, the tables have turned. India is now among the must-owned markets and with sustained outperformance it has only gained significance in the new investing world where incremental flows are ex-China.One should expect them to be persistent buyers over the coming few years in India. The extent of their commitment and flows would remain enslaved to earnings growth trajectory and relative performance/valuation gap against EM peers.FII ownership of Indian equities has been on a downward trajectory over the past 4 quarters and is at its lowest level since Sept’22. It peaked in Dec’20 at 20.7% and currently stands at 17.8%.FII flows in SMID as a % of free-float is much higher than that of DMFs. On the contrary, DII ownership has been on a steady upward trajectory over the years and in March’24 at 14.5% is at the 2nd highest level since March’05.In conjunction, over the last decade, retail participation has also risen considerably leading to retail ownership rising from 9.48% in June’14 to ~11% in March’24.The attractiveness of investible space needs to be looked in terms of relative opportunities. While PERs are good starting point a deeper insight comes from the EYBY gaps and earnings growth differentials within these spaces against the market.The pendulum is certainly swinging to the extreme in the SMID space. The excess earnings growth differential of mid-caps over large-caps declined over the last two quarters and currently stands at -34% (mid-caps – large-caps).The same for small-caps stands at -7%. Mid-cap EYBY Gap stands at -4.6, and close to all time worst levels, as compared to the 7-year average of -3.6. Similarly, Small-caps stand at -4.1 as compared to the 7-year average of -2.6.Any query run for finding potential opportunities finds SMID space trading at ~30%+ premium to the comparable large cap space. We think for the foreseeable near term – opportunity of outperformance is more in the large cap space than the SMIDs.For a USD 8600 GDP per capita (at PPP level) at-inflection economy – there are multiple tailwinds playing out for India. India's economic landscape is primed for a prolonged growth trajectory, underpinned by demographic tailwinds, digital transformation, democratic stability, and holistic development initiatives.This nexus is accelerating megatrends spanning premiumization, fintech proliferation, market consolidation, healthcare upgrade(s), formalization, urbanization, import substitution, and manufacturing resurgence, alongside a generational capex upcycle.For discerning investors, this paradigm shift presents compelling alpha-generation opportunities across sectors such as aspirational consumption, consumer discretionary, home improvement, BFSI, capital goods, and healthcare.These verticals, poised to harness structural economic transitions, offer potential for sustained outperformance in long-horizon investment theses.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: 'More FAME, Less GST' - What the EV industry wants from FM Sitharaman","EV calculator How much will I save if I choose an electric vehicle? SELECT vehicle type Calculate



The Union Budget FY25 should offer GST concessions for electric vehicles along with incentives like FAME 3.0 , industry players have suggested. Some also said that there is a need to nurture the resale market for the EV industry. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the the first annual budget of Modi 3.0 on July 23.""Standardising Green energy open access rules, toll exemptions for electric buses, optimising charging costs through regulatory measures and opening government electric bus depots to private players are important to creating a suitable ecosystem. Initiatives such as wayside charging infrastructure on national highways, specialised facilities at transport hubs and strategic highway adoption plans for pure electric bus operations will also help sustainable mobility.We endorse the ongoing success of FAME subsidy, especially FAME 2, with a Rs 10,000 crore budget and recommend FAME-III scheme to further enhance adoption of electric vehicles. Providing capital subsidy to private electric bus operators on inter-city routes will increase adoption on a large scale. The government's commitment to boosting manufacturing and exports is evident through PLI Schemes for Automobiles, Auto Components, Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC), and Battery Storage.To improve cost and sustainability, we strongly propose for a 5% GST on lithium-ion batteries, EV spare parts, components and correcting inverted duty structure in EV production. Standardising battery switching and tackling low-cost finance difficulties are critical for long-term growth. The government's achievements in alternate fuels, renewable energy, and manufacturing through PLI programmes such as Biofuel Policy & National Green Hydrogen Policy, highlights the importance of these projects.""""During the interim budget, we saw the government’s commitment towards expanding the EV ecosystem in India and underscored the need to develop more charging stations. While lauding previous initiatives like FAME II and EMPS, expectations are high for a new subsidy scheme akin to FAME II, with equivalent value but more stringent eligibility criteria for vehicle types and localization requirements. The subsidy scope is anticipated to expand, covering larger vehicle segments like trucks in addition to passenger vehicles, two-wheelers, and three-wheelers.A significant emphasis on Research & Development (R&D) and domestic manufacturing capabilities for EVs and batteries is expected, with the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme receiving further support. Revisiting EV's priority lending sector status and reinforcing efforts are also on the cards.Crucially, affordability for commercial EV fleets and planned innovation must take center stage through incentives, making EVs cost-effective for fleet operators, driving efficient logistics solutions, and fostering a sustainable transportation ecosystem. Amped-up R&D funding could unlock lighter, safer, domestically made batteries, thus lowering costs and boosting performance as well as rendering sustainable transportation practical and profitable.""“As a manufacturer of electric two-wheelers, I have optimistic expectations from the upcoming Budget 2024 and hope for favourable announcements and clarity in policy implementation. To begin with, I look forward to targeted incentives like FAME 3.0 that could make electric two-wheelers more affordable for everyday commuters, enabling us to increase our market presence. Additionally, reducing GST on EVs and offering higher purchase subsidies could help make a significant difference in the rate of consumer adoption. As an industry player, we anticipate more support for local battery production and innovation. Similarly, more support to boost the ‘Make in India’ initiative and localized manufacturing of our electric two-wheelers could help Indian EV manufacturers like us build more efficient and sustainable mobility solutions that can compete with international brands and are accessible to the broader consumer segment. I think such measures could help us enhance the overall EV ecosystem and support the electrifying transition in transportation, making green commuting a reality for millions.”""Let us cease being taken advantage of. The new Budget positions India as a unique market of great promise, it stands as the only large market with real potential. Either we fortify our economic policies to strengthen our borders, or open up completely for international competition and trade. We must achieve self-reliance through strategic support for domestic innovation and manufacturing, embodying the spirit of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. In my view, the upcoming Union Budget presents a pivotal moment for policymakers to ensure we are no longer exploited.""“As a charging infrastructure solution provider, I have high hopes for the upcoming Budget 2024 and look forward to favourable policies such as the much-awaited FAME 3 scheme. With an anticipated outlay of Rs. 10000 crore in the budget, FAME 3 could provide necessary support to EV producers and consumers. As an industry player, we also hope the upcoming budget will have specific provisions like subsidies and tax benefits for the charging infrastructure sector that could help us expand our electric vehicle charging services and accelerate the deployment of charging stations across India. This support would be important for reducing range anxiety and encouraging wider EV adaptation in the country. I also expect more funding and streamlined policies towards R&D efforts in battery technology and grid integration to support the charging sector’s growth. With the support from pro-EV budget announcements, we could align our goal of creating a greener future by strengthening charging capacity and making EV ownership more affordable for all consumers.”“The entire industry expects a positive announcement about FAME 3.0 with an anticipated outlay of Rs. 10000-crore in the Union Budget 2024. Such a timely move with provisions for lenders and borrowers could amplify EV sales penetration and incentivize more NBFCs to offer financing to fleet and retail buyers. Besides EVs, I expect the upcoming budget to announce provisions for vehicles powered by hydrogen and biofuels to pave the way for India’s cleantech space. Judging by the government’s pro-industrial stance, we can expect measures that could boost private investments through initiatives like PLI schemes and increased CAPEX allocation for MSMEs and cleantech startups including EVs and agri drones. As a cleantech financing player, I look forward to an improved investment structure, reduced interest burden for EV entrepreneurs and buyers, especially women borrowers, and a dedicated share of funds for NBFCs offering cleantech financing. I also believe that more supportive measures for cleantech NBFCs can enable the new-age financing firms to tailor their offerings per the demands of the evolving cleantech space in India.”“We expect the new policy to include support for swapping infrastructure companies like ours.”""As we approach the upcoming union budget in July 2024, we have high expectations from the government, so that there are policies that can significantly drive the adoption of electric vehicles across India. To truly accelerate India's shift towards electric mobility, we need a robust government policy that can incentivize both manufacturers, individuals, as well as the larger ecosystem. This includes subsidies, tax benefits, lower GST rates for EVs and making EVs more accessible to the larger public. Equally important is the development of a widespread and reliable charging infrastructure. We urge the government to invest in expanding this network, particularly in urban areas and also along the highways. This will address the range anxiety issue that many potential EV buyers face. Additionally, better financing options are crucial to support consumers in making the switch to electric vehicles. Affordable loans and flexible financing schemes can make EVs a viable option for a larger segment of the population. Finally, we must also consider the resale market of electric vehicles. Establishing a strong resale market with standardized valuation models will enhance the customer confidence and support the long-term adoption of electric vehicles. In these areas, we can pave the way for a greener and a more sustainable future in India.""",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/budget-2024-more-fame-less-gst-what-the-ev-industry-wants-from-fm-sitharaman/articleshow/111598424.cms

Adani foraying in shipbuilding sector?



As the Union Budget approaches, set to be presented on July 23, the defence sector is abuzz with expectations, particularly in the area of shipbuilding Experts predict a higher allocation for the defence sector in the upcoming budget, continuing the trend of previous years.The next five years are going to see a significant amount of inroads into the shipbuilding sector, as per an industry expert.India aspires to become a top 10 shipbuilder as per the Maritime India Vision 2030 and move into the top five by 2047 as detailed in the Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision.The requirement for shipbuilding and maintenance is significantly high, says Deven Choksey, MD, DRChoksey FinServ Pvt. Ltd.“On one hand, we have a defence sector that is required to be catered to, but on the other hand, due to the inland transportation requirements that the government has significantly emphasised under its Sagarmala project, a significant amount of requirement would be for the cargo going forward as far as the inland transportation is concerned,” he says in a conversation with ET.At the same time, there are commercial requirements for passenger ships as well, with an increase in leisure tourism, including in pockets like Lakshadweep, adds DRChoksey.“So, all in all, the next five years are going to see a significant amount of inroads into this particular area of activity. The clear demand is going to be for building the ships out here. India has historically held this particular position largely in the portfolio of government companies and they are not adequate at this point. Some of these companies are catering to the services of the ships which are being done by some of the private sector players.”Sitharaman disclosed the allocation of a staggering Rs 6.21 lakh crore for India's Ministry of Defence during the Interim Budget presentation in February. This marked a 4.3 per cent increase from the previous year, constituting a substantial portion of the Union Budget at 13.04 per cent.The Union Budget is expected to be an extension of the Interim Budget itself, as per experts.The market capitalisation of state-owned Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders crossed ₹1 lakh crore on July 4 after the stock surged to a lifetime high of ₹5,623.50 on the BSE. Shares of two other shipbuilding companies Cochin Shipyard and Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers also rallied 10% and 8.65%, respectively that day.Analysts attributed the rally to inflows from new defence-specific mutual funds and expectations of increased focus on the sector during the forthcoming budget.Billionaire Gautam Adani is looking to start building ships at the group's flagship port at Mundra, also the country's largest, as yards in top nations such as China, South Korea and Japan are booked out until at least 2028, forcing global fleet owners to look at alternate manufacturing sites including India for new vessels.Adani's previously unreported shipbuilding scheme is tucked away in the ₹45,000 crore expansion plan for Mundra Port that received environmental and coastal regulation zone clearance recently, according to the minutes of the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) attached to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and climate change, which approved the proposal May 15.India is currently ranked 20th in the world commercial shipbuilding market with a marginal share of 0.05%. Indian-owned and flagged ships account for about 5% of the total overseas cargo-carrying requirements of the country.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/budget-2024-defence-allocation-may-be-a-focus-will-indias-shipbuilding-sector-gain-from-it/articleshow/111601532.cms

Budget 2024 expectations : Ahead of the upcoming Union Budget 2024 presentation on July 23 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , the government is weighing a proposal to significantly raise the minimum guaranteed amount under its flagship social security initiative , the Atal Pension Yojana (APY).Currently, the scheme offers a guaranteed minimum pension ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 per month, depending on the subscriber's contributions.However, according to an ET report, in a move aimed at enhancing social security benefits, the Modi government is contemplating doubling this amount to Rs 10,000 per month. The decision on this proposal is expected closer to the budget date.Also See: India Union Budget 2024 The potential hike in APY benefits comes amidst efforts to strengthen India's social security framework, aligning with the imminent rollout of the labour code on social security.As of June 20, the Atal Pension Yojana has garnered over 66.2 million enrolments, with 12.2 million new accounts added in the fiscal year 2023-24 alone.""Some proposals have been made for making the Atal Pension Yojana more attractive, including increasing the guaranteed amount.

Budget reforms: Months after being elected to power for the third consecutive time, market experts think Prime Minister Narendra Modi would likely focus on undertaking reforms to take care of unfinished agenda from his previous term.""The Union Budget 2024-25 is significant being the first from new regime. The focus will be on taking the unfinished agenda and fast tracking some of the pending reforms,"" Jiten Doshi, Co-founder & CIO, Enam AMC told ETNow.""One can expect special focus to boost the income opportunities at the bottom of the pyramid, rationalization of taxes, driving capex cycle (public and private) while maintaining the balance on twin deficits,"" he added.Doshi says one can also expect a special focus on sectors that can support self-dependency through import substitution and cater large domestic market.PM Modi during his elections speeches said that if voted to power, the electorate could expect strong economic reforms in the coming years as the nation attempts to become a developed economy by 2047.One highlight of the Modi government , as per economists, has been their focus on fiscal consolidation. Fiscal deficit has been brought under control from Covid-era highs to 5.8 per cent of GDP in FY24.The government intends to bring the fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent of GDP by the financial year 2025-26.

It is an indication of the total borrowings that may be needed by the government.""Even if we see some expenditure allocation towards welfare spending, it may not require a reduction in capex given the higher than expected dividend transfer from the RBI,"" investment banking company Goldman Sachs said in a report on Monday.""Our fiscal impulse calculations also show that general government fiscal policy has been a drag on growth since FY22 and will remain so in FY25 and FY26 given the fiscal consolidation target of the central government,"" the report read.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/union-budget-2024-may-see-modi-government-fasttracking-reforms-to-focus-on-unfinished-agenda-from-previous-term/articleshow/111599385.cms
indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024: Don't hold your breath, electrify!","According to the World Air Quality Report 2023, India ranks among the top three countries with the highest PM2.5 levels. The report identifies Delhi as the capital with the poorest air quality, and highlights that the country is home to 42 cities among the top 50 with the worst air quality. Transportation emissions, accounting for 14% of CO₂ emissions, are among the top contributors to air pollution.According to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, achieving a clean energy transition necessitates a significant overhaul of our energy mix, including a 30-fold increase in solar, onshore and offshore wind capacity from current levels.It's critical to transform the transportation sector to reduce oil dependence, given that road transport accounts for 50% of crude oil imports. Full electrification of road transport by 2030 could yield savings of up to $10 bn by 2030, and more than $80 bn by 2050.Although EV adoption is accelerating, it remains slower compared to other major markets. About 5 mn EVs were sold globally in Q4 2024, with China leading with a 60% share, followed by Europe at 25% and the US at 10%. In contrast, India lags at 1%, with EVs accounting for only 5% of vehicle sales in FY24.There's a need to develop a new strategy that can help accelerate the EV transition by 2030. This transition should focus on electrifying India's 50 most polluted cities by 2030.eFy Electrify 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, LMVs and buses, as they are key contributors to tailpipe emissions. These 50 cities account for over 40% of India's vehicle registrations. If these cities can achieve 100% electrification in new vehicle sales by 2030, India will be well on its way to sharply reducing its oil needs.EV market, valued at $5.61 bn in 2023, is expected to reach $50 bn by 2030, potentially generating at least 5 mn direct and 50 mn indirect jobs.Technological advances have lowered costs for batteries and EV tech. OEMs have invested over $6 bn in EV tech and manufacturing plants, introducing more than 200 e-2/3-wheeler models. Battery manufacturers aim to achieve a 50 GWh capacity by 2030. Startups in this sector have surged from 15 in 2012 to 1,883 in 2023. These trends indicate that the supply side will be prepared to meet ambitious electrification targets if demand remains clear.Phase out the old Within the next 24 months, these 50 cities should retire, or retrofit, old ICE vehicles. In Delhi, this could create demand for 2 mn EVs. Also, stringent pollution checks and penalties for polluting vehicles should be enforced, and taxes levied on commercial ICE vehicles to incentivise cleaner alternatives. States must mandate zero-emission vehicles for all new registrations of autos, LCVs, taxis and last-mile delivery vehicles over the next two years.Reduce prices Promoting bulk procurement tenders drives down prices. Focusing on electrifying school buses, private buses, airport taxis, autorickshaws and 2-wheelers for government and institutional employees can accelerate price reductions. Mandating full electrification of government fleet will stimulate strong EV demand and establish a replicable model for the private and industrial sectors, delivering financial benefits for the exchequer.Incentivise Fiscal incentives will be crucial for purchasing new EVs and retrofitting existing vehicles. Extending FAME and state EV policies with predictability and consistency for the next five years, along with providing concessional finance and creating innovative risk-sharing instruments, will support this transition. Financial institutions must introduce EV financing schemes, offering favourable rates to NBFCs and leveraging partnerships with philanthropic foundations and multilateral development banks to mitigate risks.This transition presents India with an opportunity to emerge as a global leader in manufacturing new-age EVs. With the right signals in the forthcoming Union budget , increased domestic demand will enhance industry readiness, attract investments and advance technology, paving the way for entry into export markets and positioning India as an EV export hub globally.The ripple effects of this shift will profoundly impact our environment, economy and society, reshaping the future of global transportation. Ultimately, this transformation will significantly reduce pollution levels, and enhance the well- being of millions.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/budget-2024-dont-hold-your-breath-electrify/articleshow/111586438.cms

It demanded investments in public sector hospitals , an allocation of 5 per cent of GDP for health, a re-envision of PMJAY to cover outpatient care and the cost of drugs, and facilities for direct patient transfer, copayment, and reimbursement models, among others.IMA suggested that to achieve the goals of Viksit Bharat 2047, ""the health sector has to be promoted judiciously and made a priority sector, like industries, education, and agriculture.""According to a Knight Frank report last year, India needs an additional 2.4 million (24 lakh) hospital beds to reach the recommended ratio of 3 beds per 1,000 people, fuelling the demand for healthcare-related real estate space.Currently, India has an estimated 70,000 hospitals, of which 63 per cent are from the private sector.""India is facing a deficit of 2 billion sq ft of healthcare space to cater to its current population base of 1.42 billion people,"" Knight Frank India had said in a statement.""India's existing bed-to-population ratio is 1.3/1000 population (both private and public hospitals included), and there is a deficit of 1.7/1000 population.

Hotels are capital intensive with a long gestation period. Cost of operating hotels is high and largely fixed. This makes investments in hotels risky. There is a need to make hotel investments more attractive with an improved rate of investment and to promote ease of doing business,"" Hotel Association of India (HAI) President KB Kachru told news agency PTI.He emphasized that the upcoming Union Budget presents an opportunity to maximize India's hospitality sector contribution towards India Vision 2047 by redefining its policy perspective, shifting away from categorizing hotels as luxury or 'sin' goods.Kachru highlighted that HAI's primary budget recommendation is for hotels to be classified as infrastructure by the Centre.""This will allow them access to softer finances at better interest rates with longer periods for re-payment thereby attracting investment,"" Kachru was reported as saying.Puneet Chhatwal, Managing Director and CEO of Indian Hotels Company Ltd , echoed similar sentiments, stating, ""Granting infrastructure status to the sector will significantly boost investment, enabling it to catalyze India's ambition to become the third largest economy by 2027.""Chhatwal, also Chairman of CII National Committee of Tourism and Hospitality and Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality (FAITH), emphasized that the sector contributes approximately 10% of total employment in India and remains pivotal for economic growth.""To unlock India's hospitality sector, which remains underserved when compared to the major lodging markets globally, the upcoming budget must accelerate the tourism agenda,"" Chhatwal said.Sanjay Sethi, Managing Director and CEO of Chalet Hotels Ltd , emphasized that the hospitality sector, in addition to being a significant employer, demands substantial capital investments.""Our long-standing demand for infrastructure status and industry benefits at the state level will only provide significant thrust to companies to keep reinvesting for the growth of the industry,"" he added.Advantages such as lower utility tariffs, reduced property taxes, easier access to finance and softer loans are crucial for reducing the cost of doing business, ensuring the long-term viability of the sector and in turn, more investments in the sector will bolster job creation, PTI quoted Sethi as saying.(PTI inputs)",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/hotels-/-restaurants/budget-2024-hospitality-players-seek-infra-status-for-hotels/articleshow/111550900.cms

The government is actively considering doubling the beneficiary base under its flagship Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme over the next three years, with all those aged above 70 years to be brought under its ambit to begin with, and also increase the insurance coverage to Rs 10 lakh per year. The proposals, if given a go ahead, would entail an additional expenditure of Rs 12,076 crore per annum for the exchequer as per estimates prepared by the National Health Authority , official sources told PTI.""Discussions are happening to double the beneficiary base under the AB-PMJAY over the next three years, which, if implemented, will cover more than two-third population of the country with health cover, the sources said while noting that medical expenditure is one of the biggest reasons that push families to indebtedness.""Deliberations are also underway over finalising a proposal to double the limit of the coverage amount from the existing Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh,"" they said.These proposals or some parts of it are expected to be announced in the Union Budget to be presented later this month.In the interim Budget 2024 , the government increased the allocation for the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), which provides health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to 12 crore families, to Rs 7,200 crore while Rs 646 crore was assigned for the Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM).President Droupadi Murmu, in her address to the joint sitting of Parliament on June 27, had said all the elderly above 70 years of age will also be covered and get the benefit of free treatment under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana now.Those above 70 years of age add up to around 4-5 crore more beneficiaries being covered under the scheme, another source said.The limit of Rs 5 lakh for AB-PMJAY was fixed in 2018. Doubling the cover amount is aimed to cater for inflation and provide relief to families in case of high-cost treatments such as transplants, cancer etc.The NITI Aayog, in its report titled 'Health Insurance for India's Missing Middle' published in October 2021, suggested extending the scheme. It had stated that about 30 percent of the population is devoid of health insurance, highlighting the gaps in the health insurance coverage across the Indian population.The AB-PMJAY flagship scheme towards Universal Health Coverage, and state government extension schemes provides comprehensive hospitalisation cover to the bottom 50 per cent of the population.Around 20 per cent of the population is covered through social health insurance, and private voluntary health insurance primarily designed for high-income groups.The remaining 30 per cent of the population is devoid of health insurance, the actual uncovered population is higher due to existing coverage gaps in PMJAY and overlap between schemes. This uncovered population is termed as the missing middle, the report stated.The missing middle is not a monolith - it contains multiple groups across all expenditure quintiles. The missing middle predominantly constitutes the self-employed (agriculture and non-agriculture) informal sector in rural areas, and a broad array of occupations -- informal, semi-formal, and formal -- in urban areas, the report said.The report highlighted the need for designing a low-cost comprehensive health insurance product for the missing middle.It primarily recognises the policy issue of low financial protection for health for the missing middle segment and highlights health insurance as a potential pathway in addressing that.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/union-budget-2024-govt-mulls-doubling-number-of-ab-pmjay-beneficiaries-insurance-amount/articleshow/111553939.cms

In many situations, disbursements are held up on account of disconnect on the manner of computation of incremental turnover. One such example is products with seasonal production which face a challenge on computation on a full year basis.

Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations : Ahead of the Union Budget 2024 presentation by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the government is currently evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.This suggestion was put forward by banks during a recent meeting with key officials from the finance ministry.Banks have been advocating for deposit incentives due to increasing concerns about the widening credit-deposit ratio.""It (the suggestion) is under review, and there could be some relief for banks, which have demanded incentives to shore up deposits,"" a government official was quoted as saying in an ET report by Dheeraj Tiwari. The final decision on the proposal will be made closer to the budget announcement.Under the old tax regime, interest income up to Rs 10,000 per year from savings accounts is tax-exempt under Section 80TTA of the Income Tax Act . For senior citizens aged 60 and above, this limit is set at Rs 50,000 and includes interest income from fixed deposits under Section 80 TTB. However, these benefits were removed under the new tax regime, when it was introduced in the 2020 budget.""Both issues, including enhancement of the old limit and allowing interest income earned from savings accounts in scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) under existing regulations in the new regime, are being deliberated,"" said the person cited above, noting that banks had previously made a presentation on this matter.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) observed in its latest Financial Stability Report that households are diversifying their financial savings, allocating more to non-banks and the capital market.The report highlighted that the growing gap is reflected in the rising credit-deposit (C-D) ratio, which peaked at 78.8% in December 2023 before moderating to 76.8% at the end of March.Recently, HDFC Bank, the country's largest private sector lender, reported a 5% sequential decline in its current account-savings account (CASA) deposits to Rs 8.63 lakh crore during the first quarter of the current financial year.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/income-tax-expectations-budget-2024-tax-exempt-limit-for-savings-account-interest-to-be-raised-to-rs-25000/articleshow/111527288.cms

India is the world’s sixth largest textile and apparel exporter having an 11.4 per cent share in India’s overall exports. The government aims to achieve $600 billion of textile exports by 2047 from $44 billion in FY22. However, this one's a bumpy road for the Modi government. Will Budget 2024 be able to push the sector towards its goals?India also aims for the domestic market to grow to $1.8 trillion from $110 billion in 2022 owing to a rise in e-commerce and fast fashion. Furthermore, the domestic market is seen growing to $250 billion by 2030 and exports to $100 billion.Global exports of textiles and apparel has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 3.4 per cent in 2018- 2022 but India’s exports during this period have grown around 1 per cent only. Geo-political uncertainties, consumption shift to other essential and discretionary spends, adverse demographics, and low overall growth of this segment have led to this slow growth.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the Red Sea crisis and the Israel-Hamas conflict, have lately made the international trade scenario much tougher for the Indian exporters.In a report published by CRISIL in February this year, it was noted that the textiles industry is unlikely to be significantly impacted by the Red Sea crisis. However, a prolonged crisis is likely to dent margins and stretch the working capital cycle, it had said.Also Read: How Sitharaman can steer the trade ship amidst two wars and Red Sea crisis to achieve $2 tn export goal It is worth to note that the higher freight cost due to the Houthi disruption maybe a hindrance for textile exporters with a lot of trade happening through the Suez Canal. The freight rates increased by nearly 40-50 per cent, as per a TOI report.Additionally, a global 'weak demand' in textiles is another worrisome factor for the industry. The May 2024 ITMF Global Textile Industry Survey (GTIS) revealed a continued stagnation in the textile business climate and that a weak demand remains the main concern since September 2022.The government, in 2021, had approved the Rs 10,683 crore PLI scheme for textiles for five years to promote the production of man-made fibre apparel, fabrics and products of technical textiles.Also Read: Sitharaman may focus on affordable housing in Union Budget, says former HDFC CEO Keki Mistry The scheme has two parts: Part-1 promotes a minimum investment of Rs 300 crore and minimum turnover of Rs 600 crore per company and the second part envisages a minimum investment of Rs 100 crore and minimum turnover of Rs.200 crore per company.""As per Quarterly Review Reports (QRRs) as on 30.09.2023, the eligible investment made under the Scheme was Rs 2,119 crore of 30 selected applicants, out of which 12 selected applicants started commercial production, turnover achieved was Rs 520 crore including export of Rs 81 crore and employment generated was 8,214,"" the government in December 2023.In a recent PLI review meeting, it was noted that the progress as part of the government's glagship scehem has been slower than anticipated in the textiles sector.With the forthcoming budget, the industry may expect the government to address certain key issues and provide measures from finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.Primarily, Modi & Co can provide higher fund allocation to MSME which are 80 per cent of the textile market.Further, an extension of the PLI scheme for garments sector, which the government is already mulling, may take shape.Earlier on June 25, Textiles Minister Giriraj Singh said the government is now considering to extend the scheme to the garments sector with a view to boost domestic manufacturing and exports.Singh said that huge opportunities are there to increase exports and the industry should target $50 billion worth of shipments in the coming years.The ministry is also looking at reviving Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), which aims to create new parks of international standards.

We do understand in this business, it is important to have a surety for a longer period and our focus also has been more moving towards long-term PPA ,"" says Sharad Mahendra , Joint MD & CEO, JSW Energy Last one week has been really very instrumental for us in marching fast towards our plan what we have for maybe FY30. So, last week we have signed total PPAs of 2025 megawatt, which is in excess of 2 gigawatt, in which 700 megawatt of solar PPA of SJVN we have signed with the power will be supplied to state of Punjab.In addition to that, 300 megawatt of Gujarat state PPA we have signed, solar plant which we are setting up in Gujarat, in Khavda.And SECI, 1025 megawatt of wind PPA has been signed, the entire power will be supplied to state of Uttar Pradesh. So, these are the developments and some more major PPA signings are in progress. As and when it happens, definitely we will be immediately informing.Today, if you see my total portfolio, merchant is only 15%. 85% is long-term PPA. We do understand in this business, it is important to have a surety for a longer period and our focus also has been more moving towards long-term PPA.With these PPAs signing, the percentage of open capacity once these capacities get commissioned in a span of 18 to 24 months, ultimately the merchant portfolio will be even lower than 15% going forward. So, more of long-term PPAs will be there.In this if we see that technology is very-very important and it is highly demanding in terms of the right technology, right product and what it is going to be because this area is also evolving very-very fast. Today, there is a battery with maybe certain range, tomorrow something new comes.So, we are still continuing with the evaluation of the various opportunities, what is the right mix and then we will be going ahead. Right now, we are in the stage of evaluation and very soon we will be deciding on when to start the work on this project, but still we are in the evaluation and assessing the technology partners also.From budget what we expect that there are certain areas on which we need to focus. We have seen in budget what is required for the sector. One is the policy stability is very important because there should not be any fear because today we invest, project takes 18 months to 24 months, so policy stability is one key which we expect.And boost the renewable energy investment, that is also very-very important because the kind of investment which is required to add almost 40 to 50 gigawatts every year is huge.So, these are the things and also there are many factors which we definitely have made a representation whether it is related to green hydrogen, whether it is related to improving the energy efficiency, what all we expect from the government. And what all we need to do as IPPs, we are very-very sure. So, we are making our representations to the government for this budget.If you see that the way the bidding space is there, like if we see quarter four, when there was a bidding of almost 18 to 19 gigawatt last quarter which took the total bidding to almost 47 gigawatt which Government of India also has been saying that every year they will be adding 50 gigawatt.Bidding has happened at least after two years, every year we will see a capacity addition of 50 gigawatt. So, at least the first step has been taken. And that was the time when we entered into this bidding space in January, March quarter which I discussed earlier also and we were able to get almost 20% of the total bid which came in quarter four. Quarter one, of course, the start of the year slightly slow. Elections were there, the bidding happened only for 6.3 gigawatt.But I am happy to say that almost 30% of that bidding which happened JSW Energy has been able to secure that, taking our total order pipeline in excess of 5 gigawatt between January to June, which we have to execute. Out of which 2 gigawatt PPA we have signed last week. And very soon we are signing some more.The pump storage, what we have done, we have started the project work at site. We have placed the orders and we are quite sure that we will be commissioning this one gigawatt hour, which is Asia's largest and one of the largest in the world, one gigawatt hour battery energy storage, project will be commissioned before June 25 and also, in addition to that, green hydrogen also the project work has started which is country's largest green hydrogen project for captive use.Already, the project work has started and we are absolutely certain this 25 megawatt equal to 3,800 tonnes of green hydrogen and 30,000 tonnes of green oxygen project will be commissioned before March 25.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/we-expect-policy-stability-renewable-energy-investment-from-budget-2024-sharad-mahendra-jsw-energy/articleshow/111481197.cms

The Union Budget 2024 is set to be unveiled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in July 2024. The Budget is of significant interest to salaried taxpayers as it is crucial for their finances. Some items on salaried taxpayers’ wishlist are discussed in detail below.Union Budget 2023 made significant changes to the new personal tax regime tax slabs such as an increase in the basic exemption limit to Rs 3 lakh from Rs 2.5 lakh, a reduction in surcharge for taxpayers whose income exceeds Rs 5 crore, from 37% to 25%. These changes were made to make the new tax regime attractive. However, the tax rates for the old tax regime remained unchanged. Hence, there is a pressing need for a significant upgrade in the old income tax regime slab structure.Also read: Budget 2024 for Farmers: Agriculture industry wants FM to hike PM Kisan installment amount to Rs 8,000 in budget It is anticipated that the government may raise the income tax exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh from the current Rs 3 lakh limit under the new tax regime in the upcoming Budget. The new tax regime is the default tax regime now. However, there are a lot of employees opting for the old tax regime to avail of HRA exemptions, 80C deductions, etc. For the benefit of all, it is expected that the increase in income tax exemption limit in the new tax regime is extended to people opting for the old tax regime as well which is at par with the new tax regime. Similarly, increasing the standard deduction from the current level of Rs 50,000 would also help.The rental market in the top cities of India has experienced a resurgence post-pandemic, with a striking year-on-year growth of over 30% in 2023. The rental surge is fueled by the reopening of offices and the transition to hybrid work models. Today cities such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, and Gurugram also command premium rent on account of increasing economic growth. Hence, there is a need to review the House Rent Allowance (HRA) deduction, in light of the situation on the ground.Often the House Rent Allowance (HRA) component constitutes 20-30% of an employee's total pay package. At present, as per section 10(13A), the exemption for HRA is the lower of 50%/40% (depending on the category of the city of residence) of basic salary, actual HRA received or actual rent paid in excess of 10% of the basic salary. Currently, 50% of basic salary is allowed only for a few major cities. For others, it is 40%. Allowing 50% of the basic wage for more cities such as NCR, Bangalore, Pune, and Hyderabad will provide relief to a larger populace. This change is much needed as small-time cities have grown as big if not bigger than metros (e.g. Delhi, Mumbai) earlier covered under this condition.Given the focus on reducing carbon emissions, electric vehicles (EVs) are being promoted as the vehicles of the future. The demand for EVs is rising and the government is incentivizing these through various schemes and subsidies. To achieve the goal of EVs comprising 30% of all vehicle sales in India by 2030, India has been actively promoting the manufacturing and usage of EVs through schemes like FAME II. In light of this, section 80EEB was introduced in the Income Tax Act, of 1961, in 2019. This section allowed a deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum., of interest paid on loan for the purchase of an electric motor car. The deduction was from gross total income thereby reducing taxable income and tax payable on it. However, this deduction was not extended beyond March 2023. Considering that green growth is at the top of the government agenda, the government should extend the deduction under section 80EEB, preferably with an enhanced limit of Rs 2 lakh per year, to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles.The government has a vision of providing housing for all and in line with this vision, section 80EEA was also introduced in 2019 in the Income Tax Act, 1961. As per this section, up to Rs 1.5 lakh (per annum) of interest paid on a loan taken for the purchase of a house by a first-time home buyer was allowed as a deduction from gross total income. The first-time home buyer had to meet other requisite conditions also in order to avail of this benefit. However, this deduction was not extended beyond March 2022. Hence, in line with the ‘housing for all’ objective of the present government, the reintroduction of section 80EEA, which allows a deduction for interest paid on home loans for affordable housing, is hoped for. Addressing these key aspects related to personal taxes in the Union Budget 2024 would not only benefit salaried taxpayers but also make the country’s tax system more equitable and efficient.The article has been written by Aarti Raote, Partner, Deloitte India with inputs from Nidhi Agarwal, Manager, Deloitte Haskins and Sells CA LLP.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/budget-2024-should-hike-basic-income-tax-exemption-limit-to-rs-5-lakh-in-both-old-and-new-tax-regimes-deloitte/articleshow/111397422.cms

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her seventh consecutive budget since 2019, joining an exclusive group of finance ministers who have delivered at least five consecutive Union Budgets. This distinguished group includes notable figures such as Morarji Desai, Manmohan Singh, P. Chidambaram, Yashwant Sinha, and Arun Jaitley.Following the Lok Sabha elections, this budget will be the first full budget presented as part of Modi 3.0.Prior to 2016, the budget was traditionally presented on the last day of February. However, starting in 2017, the budget has been consistently presented on February 1 each year.A notable shift occurred with the Union Budget 2021 when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced a paperless format for the first time. Departing from the traditional Swadeshi 'bahi khata,' she embraced modern technology by delivering the budget using a tablet enclosed in a red cover adorned with a golden national emblem.The budget-making process typically begins in September, over six months before the presentation date, generally on February 1. Earlier this year, the Finance Minister presented a vote-on-account budget due to the General elections scheduled from April 19 to June 1.Creating a budget is a time-consuming process that involves numerous steps and consultations.The Union Budget of India is not created overnight. Instead, it involves months of meticulous planning, consultations, and compilation efforts. Here’s a look at the collaborative endeavors of various government branches dedicated to shaping the Union Budget.The Budget Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance spearheads the budget-making process. The Finance Ministry issues budget-related circulars to various entities, including states and Union Territories, Union Ministries, Defense forces, government departments, and autonomous bodies, asking them to prepare estimates for the coming year.These entities play a crucial role by preparing financial estimates for their upcoming year's spending and revenue, along with providing revised estimates from the previous year. Ministries also present comprehensive information on their earnings and expenditures from the previous year.After receiving the proposals, the revenue secretary and other top government officials conduct a comprehensive review. The Department of Expenditures and various ministries engage in extensive consultations to scrutinize all aspects of the proposals. Once approved, the data is forwarded to the finance ministry.The finance ministry conducts a thorough analysis of the data, comparing revenue and expenditure estimates to determine the comprehensive budget deficit. The government then consults with the Chief Economic Advisor to decide the most suitable level of borrowing necessary to address the deficit.After reviewing all suggestions, the finance ministry makes decisions regarding the distribution of revenue to different departments for their forthcoming expenditures. If there are disputes regarding fund allocation, the finance ministry seeks input from the Union Cabinet or the Prime Minister before proceeding.Following the allocation of funds, the finance minister engages in pre-budget discussions with diverse stakeholders to gain insights into their proposals and requirements. These stakeholders include state representatives, bankers, agriculturists, economists, and trade unions. This year, pre-budget consultations with ministries and other stakeholders started on June 22.After concluding pre-budget discussions, the finance minister, following extensive consultations with the Prime Minister, makes the final decision on the demands of these stakeholders.To mark the concluding phase of the Union Budget formulation, the government observes the annual 'halwa' ceremony. This event signifies the start of the printing of Budget documents, with the entire finance ministry staff partaking in the distribution of 'halwa.'To ensure confidentiality, officials involved in the Budget-making process enter a period of seclusion. The Budget Press, located within North Block, serves as the residence for these officers and staff until the Union Finance Minister officially presents the budget.The final step in the budgetary process is the introduction of the budget to Parliament. The finance minister delivers a comprehensive presentation on the first day of the Budget session, providing a condensed overview of crucial elements within the budget and explaining the rationale behind the proposed recommendations.After the presentation, the budget undergoes scrutiny and debate in both houses of Parliament. Once approved by both chambers, the budget is forwarded to the President for official endorsement.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/budget-faqs/union-budget-2024-who-will-present-budget-2024-and-how-is-it-prepared/articleshow/111295420.cms

indiatimes.com,"Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why 50% HRA exemption should include cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad","Budget 2024: HRA Expectations

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July. Like every year, salaried individuals are looking at FM Sitharaman to provide tax relief in the form of reduced tax rates, changed income tax slabs and even higher deductions.One such relief that is sought is to include more non-metro cities in the 50% House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption list.HRA is a common component of employee compensation packages provided by many employers.Employees receiving HRA and paying rent for their accommodation can claim a tax exemption on the allowance under the old income tax regime. The exemption amount depends on whether the employee resides in a metro city or not for tax purposes. However, if an employee receiving HRA does not live in a rented house, the entire allowance becomes fully taxable.According to an ET report quoting Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, the Income-tax Act, 1961, under Section 10(13A), provides tax exemption for HRA. The amount of HRA that can be claimed as tax exempt is the lowest of the following:1. Actual HRA received;2. Actual Rent paid minus 10% of basic salary;3. 50% of basic salary (for metro cities)/40% of basic salary (for non-metro cities).Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report - top 5 points Currently, rented houses in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai are eligible for a 50% exemption from HRA, while those in other locations fall under the 40% category. It is important to note that this classification was established over three decades ago, according to Viswanathan.As cities have expanded in terms of population and economic growth, it has become necessary to re-evaluate the way we define metro and non-metro cities.Interestingly, the Constitution (seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, also recognizes the National Capital Region (NCR), Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad as metro cities. Despite this, the HRA tax exemption for salaried individuals in these cities remains at 40% due to outdated tax laws.Also Read | Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime Residing outside of metro cities can result in a higher proportion of one's income being paid in taxes. For instance, an individual living in Bengaluru may have to pay a higher average rent compared to someone residing in Kolkata or Chennai, which are classified as metro cities for tax purposes.Those living in rapidly developing non-metro cities, as defined by the Income-tax Act, may pay higher rents due to rapid urbanization. But, they receive lower tax benefits for house rent compared to metro cities. With an increasing number of people relocating to these non-metro cities for employment, it is crucial for the government to reassess the regulations for claiming rent exemptions to alleviate the financial strain on taxpayers, feel experts.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-why-50-hra-exemption-should-include-cities-like-bengaluru-hyderabad/articleshow/111285779.cms

indiatimes.com,Section 80C deduction in Budget 2024: Will the government increase Section 80C limit under the old income tax regime in Budget?,"What is the section 80C benefit?

Why the section 80C limit should be increased

It reduces individual's tax burden

It helps them save for financial goals such as retirement, children education, etc.

Facilitates home purchase

It provides a sense of security to them.

How to claim Section 80C deduction

Many taxpayers choose the section 80C benefit as their preferred tax-saving option. Under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, individuals can avail a maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh for the fiscal year 2024-25 if they opt for the old tax regime. Those who choose the new tax regime are not eligible to avail of this deduction.Also read: Budget 2024 HRA Exemption: Will Bengaluru, Hyderabad, other non-metro cities be included in 50% HRA tax exemption list? During his tenure, the 80C benefit limit was raised to Rs 1.5 lakh annually by the then finance minister, Arun Jaitley, in 2014. This change was one of the major forms of relief given by the government in its first budget. However, since then, there has been no adjustment to the 80C limit. This year signifies a decade since the last increase in 2014.Income tax relief: Budget 2024 may increase standard deduction under new income tax regime Every year, many taxpayers hope the finance minister will raise the Section 80C limit in the Union Budget 2024.The 80C limit has not increased in line with many people's income and costs. Because of this gap, many taxpayers end up using up the entire 80C limit.Under section 80C, the maximum tax deduction allowed to the taxpayer is Rs. 1.5 lakh. However, the taxpayer is free to invest in one or more savings vehicles.Also read: Income tax deductions available under section 80C in India The deduction under section 80C is available only to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs. Taxpayers can claim the deduction for investments in specified savings plans or for payments towards specific investments and expenses covered under the 80C category.An individual's taxable income is calculated by deducting the amount of his eligible section 80C deduction from his gross total income. Therefore, any change in the section 80C deduction cap directly affects an individual's taxable income and, in turn, their tax obligation.For many, costs have risen, salaries have gone up, but the section 80C benefit has not kept pace. Due to this many end up exhausting the limit quickly. That is why increasing the limit in section 80C is always a top priority for taxpayers before the budget each year.Also read: Why govt should increase Section 80D tax exemption limit under old tax regime The cost of living has significantly increased, compounded by the adverse impact of the pandemic. The increase in section 80C limit will help individuals increase their savings, which is necessary considering the current rate of inflation.In order to qualify for the Section 80C deduction from gross taxable income, an individual must make an investment in designated expenditure. Once a person has entered all of their income and arrived at their gross taxable income, they claim the deduction on the ITR form. The net taxable income is obtained by deducting certain amounts from this income. The tax liability is computed on this net taxable income.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/section-80c-deduction-in-budget-2024-will-the-government-increase-section-80c-limit-under-the-old-income-tax-regime-in-budget/articleshow/111250865.cms

An interim budget is a temporary financial blueprint designed to cover expenditures for a short period, usually until a new government takes office.

Now that the new government is in place, a comprehensive budget for the remainder of the fiscal year will be introduced in July. What is fiscal deficit?

A ""fiscal deficit"" represents the gap between a government's total revenue and its total expenditure within a financial year. This deficit highlights how much the government's spending surpasses its earnings. It's important to note that when calculating total revenue, borrowings are excluded.

Union Budget: Among the many suggestions it made to the Finance Ministry, industry lobby group PHDCCI has suggested focusing on the agriculture sector in the upcoming Union Budget as it can act as a pool of employment generation.""India's workforce is predominantly engaged in agriculture and the informal sector. Agriculture growth depends on rural infrastructure, private sector involvement, and waste reduction. Accelerating reforms in agriculture and food processing, coupled with increased public investments in agricultural infrastructure, can spur employment,"" PHD Chamber Of Commerce And Industry said in its pre-Budget recommendations.""Increase public investments in agri-infrastructure such as cold chain infrastructure to store and transport agriculture products to strengthen agriculture supply chains,"" PHDCCI added.With the Union Budget likely to be announced in the second half of July 2024, PHDCCI outlined certain recommendations to boost India's economy across various sectors, focusing on green initiatives, industry growth, MSME support, and more.To simplify taxation, PHDCII has suggested reducing tax rates for individuals and LLPs, increasing prosecution limits in TDS matters, and reducing pre-deposit amounts for CGST appeals. These measures aim to create a more business-friendly environment and encourage economic expansion.PHDCCI sought the need for lower interest rates to encourage financing for green projects and suggests replicating NTPC's Methanol production prototype using captured carbon dioxide across thermal plants. To aid the wind energy sector, it recommended improving road infrastructure for transporting large turbine blades and offering capital investment subsidies and custom duty exemptions for wind turbine manufacturing. The manufacturing sector should aim to increase its GDP contribution beyond 25%, leveraging the export of high-tech products, the lobby group said.To support MSMEs, PHDCCI proposed including Medium Enterprises in MSME Facilitation Councils to resolve delayed payments and extending classification norms for NPAs to 180 days. For improved ease of doing business, focus should shift to Tier 2 cities, SMART Cities, and rural areas, with recommendations to lower the costs of capital, power, land, logistics, and labor, it said.PHDCCI also asked for expanding the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to more sectors, including medicinal plants and handicrafts, to foster startup growth.

Representatives from India's capital markets have urged Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to increase Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on high frequency traders. The demand was put before the FM in a pre-budget consultation meeting on Thursday.STT is applicable on every sale and purchase of equities listed on the exchanges. The rate of STT during the sale of options or futures is 0.017% and 0.01%, respectively.Moreover, there was no discussion on a proposal for additional tax levy on futures & options (F&O) trades to discourage trading among retail investors, ETNow reported citing its sources.Earlier on Thursday, it was reported that the upcoming Union Budget could impose higher tax on F&O income. It was in view of hyperactive retail traders losing tonnes of money in the derivatives market. The report said the government is said to be considering a proposal to impose higher income tax on F&O by treating it akin to income from lottery or cryptocurrencies in the Union Budget.Under this, the government is mulling adjustments to the tax treatment of F&O transactions by reclassifying it from 'business income' to 'speculative income' and even imposing a TDS, Financial Express reported.Being planned to curb retail participation in the derivatives market, the change will mean that F&O income may start getting the same tax treatment as lotteries and cryptocurrencies.Currently, income from F&O transactions is treated as business income and taxed according to income slabs of 5%, 20%, and 30%. The existing classification also allows gains from F&O to be offset against losses from other business activities.Applying TDS to F&O would allow the government to track investors in the market more effectively and also deter frequent trading, according to the report.The industry also gave suggestions to launch the Jan Nivesh campaign for creating financial inclusion awareness. ""We requested honourable FM to launch a Jan Nivesh campaign to create financial inclusion for crores of Indians who are stuck in ponzi schemes and speculations,"" Nilesh Shah , Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company said in a tweet.Also Read: Indian rupee hits new lifetime low against US dollar.

Economists met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday to discuss the upcoming Budget , focusing on growth, fiscal policy, investment, and private sector involvement while addressing food inflation and overall debt. Among the topics was the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment, with a proposal for a “robot tax” to reskill displaced workers, ToI reported.Also Read: Economists bat for capex push, fiscal prudence and more jobs at pre-Budget meet The discussion with the finance minister covered various critical areas, including measures to push private investment, job creation, maintaining fiscal prudence, and managing debt levels and food inflation. One notable topic was the increased use of artificial intelligence and its potential impact on employment. An economist suggested exploring the idea of a “robot tax,” which could fund the reskilling and rehabilitation of workers affected by AI-driven displacement.The recommendation for a “robot tax” aligns with a paper by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which, while acknowledging that AI can enhance employment and wages overall, also warned of the possibility of significant job losses for extended periods, making the transition painful for many workers. Although the IMF paper advised against implementing a “robot tax,” it highlighted the need to reassess labor policies and social protection mechanisms.The IMF paper suggested a stronger focus on skilling and sector-based training alongside expanding unemployment insurance coverage and considering wage insurance. It also recommended that countries review their current corporate tax systems to see how they incentivize investments in automation.In a recent interview, IMF first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath emphasized the significant challenge AI poses for developing countries, which often lack extensive social safety nets.“If you look at the fraction of young people who are neither in school, nor working or in any kind of training, that number is much higher than in advanced economies. Which means that their ability to either benefit from the transition or adapt to the transition is going to be more difficult. These are areas where developing countries will have to invest more in trying to provide a stronger digital infrastructure, more education and training so that they can also benefit from this technology,” she said.Economists noted the uncertain full impact of AI technology but acknowledged its potential for significant productivity gains. They also recognized that AI might create new types of jobs, although the government should prepare for related challenges. While it is not confirmed if AI-related steps will be included in the upcoming Budget, the technology may be mentioned in the Economic Survey, which will be presented before next month's Union Budget The conversation between economists and the finance minister reflects ongoing efforts to balance technological advancement with economic stability and social welfare. The discussions underscore the importance of strategic planning in addressing the implications of AI on the labor market and broader economic policies.(with ToI inputs)",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-how-about-a-robot-tax-in-budget-economists-pitch-the-idea-for-ai-hit-jobs/articleshow/111134318.cms
indiatimes.com,"View: FAME III, tax rationalization, PLI tweak & more - What the Indian EV sector needs from Budget 2024-25","

India has come a long way in transforming its roads to electric. According to IBEF, India is the world’s third-largest automobile market, the largest manufacturer of three-wheelers, passenger vehicles, and tractors, and the second-largest manufacturer of two-wheelers. The country is poised to become the largest by 2030.Understanding the vast opportunities and benefits of electric vehicles, the Indian Government in recent years has taken commendable and encouraging steps to develop and strengthen this ecosystem. India today is one of those countries which proudly supports the EV 30@30 Campaign, aimed at realizing the benefits of electric mobility for innovation, economic, industrial development, energy security, and reduction of local air pollution by reaching 30% sales share for EVs by 2030.With the recently announced NDA government at the helm for a 3rd time, the Finance Minister of India, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, will table the Union Budget 2024-25 next month, and we expect that this will lay the foundation stone of developing a robust EV ecosystem in the country to achieve our sustainable development goals and position India as a global EV leader.The EV sector in the country scaled new heights recently with 100% FDI, new manufacturing hubs, better charging infrastructure, battery manufacturing, subsidies, favourable policies and incentives. The Union Cabinet also paved the way for a production-linked incentive scheme to boost the manufacturing of electric vehicles, their components and cells/batteries. The EV market in India, as per an independent study by CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF), will be a US$ 206 billion opportunity by 2030. A shift towards clean mobility is surely a much-needed step here and for this, along with rationalization of taxation policies, this year we expect more announcements of schemes, policies and moves such as the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME) III scheme to make electric vehicles affordable and develop EV infrastructure in the country.FAME II scheme was incredibly successful and paved the way for EVs to set foot. After its end in March 2024, the industry has been reeling and was unable to recover under the 4-month interim EMPS scheme where subsidies were reduced by 50%. We expect that the government will announce FAME III subsidies at the same levels of FAME II and continue to boost such initiatives to develop a robust charging infrastructure across the country that will go a long way in broadening the scope of opportunities. Subsidies for commercial vehicles need to continue, and should include LCVs too, which will power the regional routes outside cities. We expect rationalization of taxation policies until cell manufacturing is indigenized at commercial scale.This year, we expect announcements that will address the existing challenges such as reduced criteria in PLI to support young companies; push to nationalized banks for financing of EVs; and a small budget for standing guarantor for FLDG in vehicle financing.Today, there is also a strict need to pump investments in infrastructure building and an efficient regulatory approval mechanism will also benefit the sector. Moreover, tax reliefs on EV charging-as-a-service will motivate charging point operators to set up businesses and tackle the issue of lack of availability of charging points practically and easily. There is also a need to be more liberal with infrastructure spending and subsidizing services in residential areas for better EV penetration in the country.With large-scale internet penetration, e-commerce and logistics services have boomed in the country, leading to a surge in demand for last-mile delivery vehicles. The big e-commerce players in India are now revamping their approach to adopt sustainable and responsible delivery models to reach their customers and many of them have set a target of introducing electric vehicles in their logistics and delivery network. There is an increased awareness and interest in having sustainable modes of transport as several cities continue to face higher pollution levels than ever before. We expect the Budget 2024 will focus on giving incentives to businesses who adopt EVs for last-mile delivery operations and will also make announcements on creating robust manufacturing capabilities to cater to the rising demand across the country.Also, the EV ecosystem in India is still in a nascent stage and there is a need to train a large part of the workforce in manufacturing and after-sales services. There is a need to focus on large upskilling schemes and programs to make the workforce ready to work in this growing industry. We expect the Budget will announce funds to skill India and also on reskilling the workforce as per the technology demands.We expect Budget 2024 will announce mass public programs and schemes to raise awareness, much like LED and rooftop solar campaigns, and influence customer behaviors, and encourage buyers to adopt electric mobility for a better future and greener India.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/view-fame-iii-tax-rationalization-pli-tweak-more-what-the-indian-ev-sector-needs-from-budget-2024-25/articleshow/111103022.cms

Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations: The Modi government is mulling over the possibility of reducing personal tax rates for specific groups of individuals, according to two government sources who spoke to Reuters. This move has the potential to stimulate consumption in India, which is the third-largest economy in Asia.The sources, who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of budget discussions, indicated that the plan might be unveiled in July when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the first Union Budget following the Modi 3.0 government.Also Check | Income Tax Slabs FY 2024-25 Explained: New Tax Regime Vs Old Tax Regime - What are the tax rates, slabs & surcharge rates?

Budget 2024



Industry lobby body CII is looking at more hikes in India's planned capex spending in the upcoming Budget for this fiscal year to push growth in an economy that seeks to be the world's third-largest by 2030. India needs to increase the capex target by 25 per cent in budget from the previous fiscal year, as it will boost the economy and strengthen competition, said CII President Sanjiv Puri at an event on Thursday.""Increase capex by approximately 25 per cent in FY25 over RE of FY24 vs 16.8 per cent increase in the Interim Union budget,"" said Puri, Chairman & Managing Director at ITC The Modi government in its second term had pushed on with its capex agenda, to the point where it remains one of the major drivers of India's GDP.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during the interim budget in February proposed to raise the capital expenditure target by 11.1 per cent to record Rs. 11.11 lakh crore for the next fiscal year starting April 1, as the government hopes to further shore up demand and consumption in the economy.The ratio of capex-to-GDP, which rose to 3.3 per cent for FY24, is estimated at 3.4 per cent in the new financial year. India's capex in FY21 and FY22 stood at Rs 4.1 lakh crore and Rs 5.9 lakh crore, respectively.The CII president said that India needs many big banks and he wants the government to take steps towards implementation of bank privatisation plan.On indirect taxes, Puri said, the next set of GST reforms such as bringing GST under the three-rate structure with moderation of rates and bringing Petroleum products, electricity, and real estate under GST should be expedited in consultation with the GST Council.""Further, to facilitate India’s engagement with the GVCs, a three-tier import duty structure should be considered, with raw materials at the lowest rate followed by intermediates and then the finished goods,"" he added.Comparing India to South Korea, Puri said, ""The number of formally skilled Indians is around 5 per cent as compared to 80 per cent in Korea. "" It has to be 25 per cent by 2030 to provide resources for growth, he added.India’s human capital should be a priority for inclusive growth and for industry competitiveness he said. ""The government should lay down roadmaps to raise the expenditure on public health (to 3 per cent of GDP) and education (to 6 per cent of GDP) by 2030 and focus on skill development initiatives,"" added Puri.""Private investment situation is now improving and has become robust,"" he said.Puri has suggested employment-linked incentive scheme needs to be launched for specific sectors to leverage the demographic dividend.CII surveys show increased capacity utilisation, said Puri. Climate for investment is now favourable, he said.Seeing green shoots of pickup in rural areas, Puri said that with a better monsoon, realizations will also improve.He said that lot of reforms have happened and what is left will ""unlock the next journey of growth in the economy.""The full budget is expected to be announced in the second part of July 2024 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's NDA elected to power for the third consecutive term only in early June.Among the more contentious issues in the Lok Sabha elections were unemployment and rising inequality in the country, despite Indian economy emerging as the fastest growing among its peers. The main focus areas for Sitharaman will be sustaining high growth, making it more inclusive and creating employment. Rationalising GST is expected to be high on the agenda, as will be easing tax compliances, ET reported earlier this week.Last week, RBI projected the economy to grow 7.2 per cent in the current fiscal on the back of improving rural demand and moderating inflation. Despite India registering a growth of 8.2 per cent in FY24, there are worries around lagging private investment, an area the government is expected to address. Another key area would be rural distress.PM Modi had already asked the ministries to draw up a 100-day agenda with an eye on 'Viksit Bharat', or a developed India by 2047. The Centre is also expected to continue its focus on pushing quality infrastructure through capital expenditures, as announced in the Interim Budget by Sitharaman in February 2024.Fiscal consolidation remains on top of the government's agenda, with the Reserve Bank of India's bumper dividend of Rs 2.11 lakh crore giving the government enough elbow room to work towards its fiscal deficit target whilst planning welfare expenditures. The government had targeted to reduce fiscal deficit to 5.1 per cent of GDP in the current fiscal compared with 5.6 per cent in the previous year, with the goal to bring it down further to 4.5 per cent.Rating agencies expressed their apprehension over the Centre continuing its focus on fiscal consolidation, given the lack of a majority for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in the recently concluded general elections.Moody's expects the upcoming Budget to give a direction towards the policy priorities of this coalition government. ""The union budget, due in the September quarter, will be an early indicator of policy priorities, including short- and long-term responses to some of those key economic challenges. Other key areas to watch include capital expenditure allocated to infrastructure development, manufacturing and social services,"" the global research firm noted.Rating agency S&P has endorsed the Modi administration's economic policies over the past decade by upgrading India's sovereign rating outlook to 'positive' from 'stable', even as it left the rating at 'BBB-', the lowest grade it has to offer. The agency also suggested that a further rating upgrade might be possible within the next 1-2 years, but this hinges on the government's commitment to its fiscal deficit reduction plan.With Sitharaman and other key ministers continuing their portfolios during Modi's current term, there are expectations of policy continuity.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/budget-2024-rs-11-11-lakh-crore-of-capex-plan-not-enough-cii-wants-more-in-budget-to-push-growth/articleshow/110963570.cms

With the upcoming general elections looming, the recently revealed Interim Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 has diverged from the typical pre-election pattern. Instead of succumbing to populist measures, the budget showcases a professional and forward-looking approach, indicating the government 's confidence in the upcoming elections and the overall economic landscape.A standout feature is the government's adept handling of fiscal consolidation alongside capital expenditure. The unexpected Fiscal Deficit target for FY25, set at 5.1% of the GDP , pleasantly surprised the market, which had anticipated a higher figure. Keeping such an aggressive target has several positive implications for the market.A lower fiscal deficit implies reduced government borrowing, leading to a diminished demand for bonds. This, in turn, is expected to lower bond yields and elevate bond prices. The direct beneficiaries of this fiscal stance are corporate borrowers, as it reduces their overall interest costs.Lower borrowing costs would also materially benefit the NBFCs which source their capital from banks. Higher bond prices would mean that the bond portfolios would witness a significant MTM rise and therefore institutions holding bond portfolios would benefit like the banks and life insurance companies.Apart from the fiscal consolidation, the other part that the market was keenly interested in was capital expenditure. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an 11.1% increase in the Centre's capital expenditure for FY25, reaching Rs 11.1 trillion. While this growth rate might seem slower compared to the post-pandemic surge, the crucial point lies in the capital expenditure's share, set to touch 23.3% of total expenditure – the highest since the 1994-95 Budget. This underscores the government's commitment to public investment-led growth, providing a significant boost to the country's infrastructure development.The Interim Budget's continuation of the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY) is also noteworthy. The commitment to constructing two crore more houses under PMAY-G, along with a special scheme for urban middle-class families, not only addresses long-standing housing needs but injects vitality into the housing loan segment, propelling growth in the real estate sector. This, in turn, creates a ripple effect, benefiting ancillary industries such as cement, steel, paints, and more.In a broader context, the macro-policy approach reflected in this budget is commendable.

A corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore with a 50-year interest-free loan will be a major boost for the start-up ecosystem. The long-term financing and re-financing will encourage the private sector to scale up research and innovation to chart new horizons.The Indian entrepreneurs are also becoming ‘rozgardata’. The Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes are assisting our youth.

Budget 2024 expectations: In the dynamic landscape of global tourism, countries worldwide are recognising the pivotal role of efficient visa and consular services in fostering international travel . As India continues to position itself as a global tourism hub, the inclusion of more streamlined visa and consular services in the Union Budget planning emerges as a critical need.India, with its rich cultural heritage and diverse attractions, stands to gain significantly by prioritising streamlined visa and consular services in the Union Budget planning. This article delves into the need for an improved visa system and how it can contribute to attracting more foreign tourists, with a particular focus on the allure of India's religious heritage sites.The ease of travel will undoubtedly contribute to an influx of foreign tourists, eager to explore the cultural and spiritual riches that India has to offer. By capitalising on its religious heritage sites, India cannot only boost tourism numbers but also showcase the country's unique identity to the world.Speaking on this, Sandeep Arora, Director, Brightsun Travel, shares, “We are looking forward to the Union Budget 2024-25, and the travel industry holds high expectations for it. As India strives to establish itself as a global travel hub, this budget is crucial for charting a visionary roadmap. There is a need to emphasise streamlining visa and consular services through digital platforms to facilitate smoother processes. This will not only lead to an increase in inbound travel but also facilitate outbound travel for Indians, making the entire experience hassle-free.’He adds, “With India's rich cultural heritage, focusing on ramping up the connectivity and infrastructure of high-potential tourist destinations could potentially double our foreign tourist arrivals. The recent opening of the Ayodhya International Airport is a step in the right direction. Industry experts have already appealed to the government to declare high-potential tourism regions like Ayodhya, Hampi, and Bodh Gaya as Special Tourism Investment Regions (SITR) so that these destinations are prioritised, and all the powers required for their planning and development are transferred to a tourism development authority.”Boosting tourism numbers: Streamlining visa processes can significantly enhance the ease of travel for foreign tourists, attracting a more diverse range of visitors to India. A simplified visa application process and faster consular services can reduce barriers and encourage more travellers to explore the country.Enhancing global perception: A hassle-free process sends a welcoming message to potential tourists, making them more inclined to choose India as their destination.

Railways capex is expected to further increase to 20% growth YoY while defence spending growth may be in single digits.Here are stocks and sectors that could be in focus when Nirmala Sitharama presents the Budget:Market watchers expect the major focus will be on key infrastructure segments such as roads, railways, airports, and urban infrastructure. ""With the government focusing on increasing the road network, we expect a 10%-15% higher allocation YoY for the ministry of road transport & highways. Similarly, Railways should also witness higher budgetary allocation in 2024,"" Axis Securities said.“We expect the government capex will further increase by 10-15% in FY25. In the last fiscal (FY24), the government pegged the capex target of Rs 10 lakh crore. Focus is likely to continue on developing the country’s public infrastructure such as roads, water, metro, railways, defense, digital infrastructure, and green technologies. Its overall focus would also be on creating more jobs and achieving investment-driven growth. Furthermore, the private Capex, which has been sluggish for the last several years, is expected to receive a much-needed push in the upcoming budget,” it said.Click here to checkout Budget 2024 Live Coverage Infra stocks on watchlist include L&T, PNC Infratech, Dalmia Bharat, KNR Construction, PNC Infratech, RITES, KEC International, Ahluwalia Contracts, Astral and Tata Power.The Budget might unveil a few sops, like potential tweaks in tax slabs and enticing incentives aimed at reviving economic activity, especially in the rural economy, Sharekhan said. The Budget may also increase allocation under various rural schemes including MNREGA (was Rs 60,000 crore in Union Budget 2023) and various skill development schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna 2.0 (budgetary outlay is Rs 12,000 crore).With the rural economy still not showing a sign of 100% recovery to pre-Covid levels, higher rural spending is likely in the upcoming budget, with more focus on affordable housing.A boost to rural consumption would also support discretionary spends and thereby benefit rural-focused two-wheelers and entry-level four-wheeler OEMs, along with auto ancillary companies supplying to such OEMs, analysts say.Rural-themed stocks in focus include Maruti Suzuki, Minda Corp, Hero MotoCorp, M&M, Escorts Kubota Ltd, Hindustan Unilever, ITC and Dabur India.Indigenisation of defence and defence exports may also receive a push in the Budget. Defence capex is expected to increase 5–8% YoY with higher allocation towards R&D, UAV/drones, anti-drone systems, etc as some key large systems are already in the pipeline, Nuvama said.Stocks in focus include BEL, BHEL, HAL, Mishra Dhatu Nigam, Mazagon Dock and Cochin Shipyard.(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Increased allocation for the education sector should be on the cards

Allocations should boost educational infrastructure and technology

""

A thoughtful GST policy will empower EdTech companies

— Mr. Amit Kapoor, Co-founder and CEO, Eupheus learning

Union Budget 2024 is eagerly anticipated by stakeholders in the education sector, with a focus on diverse expectations. They are looking forward to initiatives that will help in more effective implementation of NEP , greater emphasis on the R&D of design education, higher allocation to boost technology and more. Read on to know what these experts are expecting from the Interim Budget 2024 .“The budget for education needs to empower our youth to be ready for a fast-evolving world. The interim budget can lay the groundwork for NEP’s vision and objectives with IC2: infrastructure, capacity and collaboration. In order to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education, including vocational education, from 26.3% (2018) to 50% by 2035, we require investments and capacity addition. Plans such as integrating Anganwadis with elementary schools and including a ‘Preparatory Class’ or ‘Balavatika’ before Class 1 require additional infrastructural facilities, building teacher capacities and hiring additional teachers in elementary schools. Similarly, extending health check-ups and growth monitoring and schemes such as PM Poshan and Swayam require budgetary support. We may also see a trend towards increased international collaborations through Multi-disciplinary Education and Research oriented Universities, along with EdTech and other private institutions through internships and training.There is less likelihood of a significant increase in budgetary allocation in the education sector due to the wider aim to narrow the fiscal deficit, coupled with modest aggregate domestic demand and the implementation of the Model code of conduct before the general elections. Post elections, we hope that leveraging India’s demographic dividend by increased spending in the education sector is considered a priority.”“As we await the upcoming budget, it's crucial to improve India's design sector. Key measures should include establishing a National Design Research Fund, annual budgets for design education, and incentives for Design Faculty development. Collaboration with industries and more scholarships will make design education more accessible. Emphasizing the importance of nurturing youth talent for the digital economy, the budget should also focus on infrastructure building for design labs. Supporting co-funded research projects and providing grants for advanced tools will drive innovation. The ‘Design In India’ initiative, with targeted campaigns and scholarships, can attract global talent, enrich the learning environment, and showcase India's design capabilities globally. This holistic approach will integrate design into the nation's economic and educational framework.''“I look forward to the forthcoming budget with the expectation that it will align with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. A substantial increase in budgetary allocation for education, from 2.9% to 6% of the GDP, is crucial for the policy to deliver its full potential and attain national objectives on the path to global leadership.”As we sail into this year, our focus remains on bridging the social gap, providing quality education and enhancing the learning outcomes of students. With the upcoming union budget 2024, we eagerly anticipate allocations that boost the educational infrastructure, including cutting-edge technologies, enhanced accessibility across diverse regions and a conducive regulatory environment for education technology players. These initiatives will play a key role in accomplishing the objectives of NEP 2020 and moving our nation towards a competitive global standing. I am confident that this budget will serve as a driving force, steering India towards a future where education becomes the cornerstone of progress and prosperity for all.""“The transformative NEP 2020 and an elaborate NCF 2023 have mandated holistic and experiential learning for school students. It also involves intervention at the infrastructure level, digitalization being the key. This will involve an even higher level of engagement of schools with the EdTech companies. As we await the upcoming budget, a thoughtful GST policy, coupled with incentives will empower EdTech companies like ours to innovate and create tools and techniques for schools to implement these key mandates.”",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/union-budget-2024-education-sector-expects-higher-allocation-and-comprehensive-nep-implementation/articleshow/107298317.cms

As India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Interim Budget 2024-25 on February 1st, stock market data research firm William O'Neil India has presented its views on some of the sectors that will be in focus in this year's budget session.According to William O'Neil, sectors like automobile, insurance, hospitality & tourism, real estate, pharma, infrastructure, energy, aviation, and agriculture will remain in focus.In a report, the market data research firm said, ""The Finance Minister will present a vote on account in this election year of 2024, signaling no major policy announcements. While the budget's significance should not be underestimated, it offers the outgoing government a chance to highlight its economic achievements before the general elections.""Currently, various measures have been taken by the GOI, like the introduction of FAME subsidy, state policies, the setting up of EV charging ecosystems, and the rolling out of PLI schemes. For the Union Budget 2024, the industry expects long-term measures that promote EV adoption, such as reduced GST rates, extensions of FAME-II subsidies, and increased infrastructure spending for changing infrastructure.Meanwhile, there has been a proposal to reduce the GST on lithium-ion batteries from 18% to 5%, which will help reduce the cost of acquiring EVs. Since batteries are a major cost component in EVs, the move will reduce the overall cost of batteries and make EVs more affordable for buyers. Also, a tailored PLI scheme for lithium-ion battery recycling will be a game changer, which will amplify the sector’s growth, while advancing India’s sustainability goals.In the upcoming Union Budget, the industry is expecting a substantial increase of 15-20% in funds toward the sector, considering the government’s substantial increase in infrastructure initiatives. The sector is expecting the rationalization of duties on ATF and a sharp reduction in airport charges, including parking charges, landing, and navigation charges levied on them. The budget is also expected to accelerate the focus on setting up new airports and expanding capacities at key airports to avoid current capacity constraints.Section 80C provides tax benefits of up to Rs 1.5 lakh to taxpayers for investing in various financial instruments like PPF, life insurance, ELSS, and the National Savings Certificate. Industry participants believe that there is an urgent need for a different tax exemption category for term insurance. They feel that the above category is already clustered and a separate category will incentivize taxpayers to opt for term plans with higher coverage.They have also advocated for a reduction in GST imposed on certain types of insurance products to increase their reach among citizens. The GST rate of 18% needs to be reconsidered, so that there are pricing benefits of insurance products for end consumers, while encouraging investments in life insurance products.Stakeholders in the real estate sector are anxiously anticipating the long-overdue granting of industry status, recognizing the sector’s crucial role in India’s economic growth. This status can act as a catalyst for increased investment and the streamlining of regulations, leading to robust development in the entire industry. Additionally, the upcoming budget is expected to focus on the affordable housing segment revive the sector and bridge the housing gap through policy impetus, tax breaks, and fiscal support.They also believe that it is crucial to increase the Income Tax Section 24’s home loan interest rates rebate from Rs 2 lakh to at least Rs 5 lakh. This move is expected to attract genuine home buyers, along with other parameters such as reduction in interest rates and tax benefits to developers.In the upcoming budget, the focus is expected to remain on the establishment of Centers of Excellence with a focus on developing research and innovation in the Pharma sector. The budget is also expected to focus on technological advancements such as Gen AI, where the government can boost investments in Artificial Intelligence.The focus is also expected to remain on unveiling the roadmap for addressing long-term infrastructure financing, increasing the number of medical and nursing colleges, and implementing fiscal reforms in the health insurance sector. At present, APIs attract a higher GST rate of 18%, whereas formulations attract a lower GST rate of 12%, leading to the accumulation of credit for the Pharma industry. This is also expected to change.The government is expected to maintain its focus on increasing capex, particularly in the infrastructure segment. The industry expects the government to allocate a capex of Rs 10.2 lakh crore in FY25. This implies growth of 10% y/y, which is expected to be lower than spending growth post the initial COVID-19 period. In the roads segment, the bulk of capital allocation is coming from the government schemes. The private sector investment has not been forthcoming. In the upcoming budget, changes to the direct tax regime are expected that will boost capital expenditure by private players in various road-related infrastructure projects.Meanwhile, expectations for railway infrastructure include sustained capex by the Indian Railways, supported by the Indian Government, and an increase in orders for private sector players. The private sector also expects that the National Railways Network plan and the preservation of the 3000 MT mission are kept intact. The focus is anticipated to be on corridor infrastructure, investment in rolling stocks, and improving passenger safety and convenience.The industry is demanding higher capex in renewable energy, particularly in bioenergy, solar, and wind projects. Investments in green hydrogen and battery storage are required and are crucial to meet the challenging targets. PLI schemes for renewable manufacturing and viability gap funding for battery storage are the need of the hour.Meanwhile, the fact that India’s solar panel imports had reached $1.13B in the first half of the current financial year is a grave concern. Hence, the budget should incorporate measures to promote indigenous development, facilitate technology transfer, and promote localized manufacturing initiatives to reduce dependence on imports. To boost hydrogen competitiveness, addressing GST rates is imperative. Lowering the GST rate for hydrogen, for instance to 5%, will make it affordable and viable for many sectors.In the upcoming interim Budget, according to consensus expects the government to announce a significant rise (15-20%) in the agricultural credit target to Rs 23-24 lakh crore for the next fiscal, aiming to ensure access to institutional credit for every eligible farmer. The current agricultural credit target is Rs 20 lakh crore, with an existing 2% interest subvention on short-term agricultural loans up to Rs 3 lakh.The substantial increase in the agricultural credit target will emphasize a focus on campaigns to identify and include eligible farmers in the credit network. The agriculture ministry has established a dedicated 'credit' division for a more concentrated approach.The travel and hospitality industry in India is a multibillion-dollar sector driven by factors such as disposable income, and it has attracted the attention of global investors. In 2023, the G20 Presidency and the Cricket World Cup have contributed to marketing India globally as a preferred destination for leisure and business alike.A primary concern or expectation raised by the industry over the years has been the restriction of indirect taxes, particularly GST on hotel bookings and restaurant services within hotels. The current GST rate stands at 18%, and there is a suggestion to reduce it to a more globally competitive rate of 12%. This will increase India’s competitiveness at the global level, attracting approximately 100M foreign tourists to India.In South East Asian countries such as Thailand and Singapore, hotel taxation ranges from 5-7%. Additionally, standardization of TCS at 5% on foreign travel packages is expected as against the current 5% and 20% slabs.(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

(Aniket Dani is Director, CRISIL MI&A)

Budget 2024 expectations: The real estate sector has a long list of expectations from the vote on account ahead of the general elections. Given the government’s strong commitment to infrastructure development and housing in recent years, stakeholders expect a slew of measures, including some that could benefit homebuyers in the vote on account and the Union Budget a few months thereafter.First on the list is another tranche of the government's contribution to the Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) Investment Fund, which has benefited scores of homebuyers and helped convert non-performing assets to performing assets.Sponsored by the Ministry of Finance and managed by SBICAP Ventures Ltd, SWAMIH Investment Fund I was the country’s largest social-impact fund specifically formed for completing stressed and stalled residential projects in the affordable-housing and mid-income-housing categories.In the three years since its inception in 2019, the fund had an outstanding impact in terms of completion of stalled projects. It was instrumental in delivering over 22,500 homes as of March 2023 and aims to complete more than 81,000 homes in the next 3–4 years across 30 Tier 1 and 2 cities amid its ambitious expansion plans.Second — and a long-standing demand — is grant of infrastructure status to real estate, which can help developers secure lower-cost funding from banks, increase the flow of foreign and private capital, and avail tax concessions. Resultantly, developers’ interest cost will decline and they will also get easier access to funds.Additionally, the status would usher in a more robust approval process in lieu of the current regime, which requires dozens of approvals from different authorities.Third, the sector is widely expecting input-tax credit in Goods and Services Tax (GST) for residential projects falling in higher GST slabs (projects other than affordable-housing projects).Also Read | Budget 2024: Make belated tax filing process easier Alternatively, the sector expects a reduction in GST on cement and steel, which account for a large part of the raw material cost and attract high GST rates at 28% and 18%, respectively.Fourth, and in another taxation-related measure, developers expect an amendment to Section 23(5) of the Income Tax Act. Under this section, the unsold property of developers is considered as stock-in-trade after two years from the date a completion certificate for a project is issued. The property is then assessed based on the property’s income based on notional rent, which, developers say, puts an additional tax burden.Developers are demanding either abolition of the concept of notional income or an increase in the timeline by five years for considering notional income. Either of these measures will ease their tax burden to some extent and help stabilise real estate prices.Fifth, the sector expects some announcement aimed at easing the burden of the average middle-class homebuyer, especially with an eye on the upcoming elections.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax: Why Rs 20 lakh and not Rs 15 lakh should be the new threshold for 30% tax rate To be sure, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), an affordable-housing programme targeted at eligible low-to-moderate income households, is well on track to achieve its objectives soon. PMAY–Gramin has been able to meet more than 85% of the target it had initially set out to achieve. With more than one crore houses in various stages of construction, PMAY–Urban too is on track to achieve its objectives.Thus, the focus could well shift to the higher middle-income group, which was not eligible for assistance under PMAY.Sixth on the list is an increase in home loan interest deduction allowed under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act. Under the current regime, deduction from total income can be claimed for interest paid on home-loan EMIs of up to Rs 2 lakh maximum. An increase in this limit is widely expected as it would provide substantial relief to home-loan borrowers who have had to shell out larger interest payments due to a comparatively higher repo rate over the past fiscal versus previous fiscals.Such a move will also increase public interest in homeownership due to improved affordability, thereby helping sustain the demand momentum. While the real estate sector has been flying high, with fiscal 2024 being touted as the potentially decadal best year for the sector by many stakeholders, homeownership remains a distant dream for many.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-from-swamih-2-0-to-bigger-home-loan-deduction-limit-6-major-expectations-of-real-estate-sector/articleshow/107299203.cms

Crux of the freebie-welfare scheme debate



The need for Revdi

Freebies’ fiscal threat





We have had a continuous debate on what constitutes freebies and do some of them quality to be welfare schemes . For the government, certain schemes that could be announced in the interim Budget may be key, as Bharatiya Janata Party seeks a third term in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections Prime Minister Narendra Modi has opposed schemes from opposition-ruled state governments that offer cash or other incentives. He termed them as ‘revdis’.“These days in our country, efforts are being made to distribute revdi (freebies) and gather votes. This revdi culture is detrimental to the country’s development. People, especially youth, need to be wary of this,” Modi said at a speech . “People endorsing this culture will never make new expressways for you, nor will they make new airports or defence corridors.Checkout LIVE BUDGET COVERAGE However, incentives or targeted benefit measures, seen as welfare schemes, are equally crucial for a country that houses the maximum population with significant income disparity. Treading the fine line between welfare schemes and freebies isn’t an easy task, on which economists have diverse opinions based on their understanding on what economic reform the nation requires.The Indian government is likely to extend some form of social security to the country's domestic workers, as a step toward universal welfare payments. Benefits include minimum wage, medical insurance, maternity benefits and provident fund, ET reported earlier in January.Analysts have also said that the government may likely increase the quantum of funds transferred under the PM Kisan scheme by around 50 per cent. Economists also expect the government to focus specifically on its flagship housing scheme PM Awas Yojana.“We expect some higher spending or rural schemes due to delayed rural recovery and some signs of distress due to erratic weather mostly in the current financial year (FY24) which implies marginal fiscal slippage or a fiscal deficit of ~ 6.2% of GDP vs the budgeted 5.9% of GDP,” Teresa John, Deputy Head of Research & Economist, Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities told ET Online.The Supreme Court of India too is yet to draw a clear distinction between freebies and welfare schemes.“Freebies and the social welfare scheme are different...The economy losing money and the welfare of people, both have to be balanced and that is why, this debate. There must be someone who can put their vision and thoughts. Please submit something before my retirement,"" CJI DY Chandrachud had said during a hearing on the matter in August 2022.Enshrined in the Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution is the establishment of the fact that India is a welfare state. One interpretation of being a welfare state is that the Indian government has to strive to protect the health and well-being of its people through subsidies, grants and other means.To this extent, central & state governments over the decades have formulated a variety of schemes targeting education, health, employment, and housing, to name a few.A certain section of society has always debated the need for welfare schemes and questioned if their hard-earned money (read: tax) is utilised effectively by the government of the time. Purposeful use of funds aside, it is undeniable that India’s ‘leave no one behind’ approach has uplifted crores of the nation’s poor and provided them with a better lifestyle.Every ruling government since 1947 has actively pushed schemes that seek to uplift India’s poor.Opposition and analysts have been quick to point out that the Modi government has also offered schemes that fall in this domain of ‘freebies’. The lack of a very clear definition adds fuel to this debate.In his attempt to define welfare schemes, former chief election commissioner OP Rawat told ET “Except for subsidies given to promote food production, direct benefits for employability, educational attainments, sports, cultural activities, free medical care to the poor, free food to those who are destitute to sustain themselves and affirmative action for weaker sections, including women, everything else is a freebie and should be so recognised.”Rawat said free power, free cell phones, free laptops etc, fall in the ambit of freebies.Offering freebies at the cost of losing the focus on fiscal consolidation may be a risk for the Indian government, which is looking to woo global investors by reducing fiscal deficit to 4.5 per cent of GDP by FY26Devoid of a set definition, the Election Commission in 2014 added a new chapter to its Model Code of Conduct wherein the parties would be asked to provide a rationale for a particular promise.Parties have announced schemes which the RBI has termed as economically regressive. The central bank has termed free electricity, water, public transportation, farm loan waivers as freebies as they “potentially undermine credit culture, distort prices through cross-subsidisation eroding incentives for private investment, and disincentivise work at the current wage rate leading to a drop in labour force participation”. The RBI has also come down heavily on states resorting to the Old Pension Scheme, citing its effects on states’ finances.The Chairman of the 15th Finance Commission NK Singh in December 2023 termed freebies a “fiscal disaster”“It is estimated that the current state expenditure on freebies ranges between 0.1% and 2.7% of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), with less developed states incurring higher amounts, although they have lower affording capacity,” Ajay Dua, former secretary in the Union ministry of commerce and industry, told ET in December 2023 ET reported recently that the PM asked states’ Chief Secretaries to guide the ruling politicians against freebies, calling for distinctions to be made on types of welfare schemes and focusing on raising capital expenditures instead. Capex is seen as a more favourable expenditure given the scope for higher dividends in the long term.The debate between freebies and welfare schemes rages on, but ahead of the General Elections, the Central government during the Union Budget may just focus on schemes that fall in line with its target of fiscal prudence.“We expect some slowdown in government capex to 15% from 25-35% over the past 2-3 years to facilitate fiscal consolidation to ~5.5% of GDP in FY25,” John said.Ahead of the Budget session, PM Modi claimed that the country through the NDA government’s policies is experiencing “all-round and all-inclusive development.”""We will follow the same tradition and present a full-fledged budget before you after a new government is formed,"" he said, adding that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will in her budget, to be tabled on Thursday, come out with measures showing a direction.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-freebies-or-welfare-schemes-what-can-the-modi-government-opt-for/articleshow/107288892.cms

With the right regulatory support, this sector has the potential to not only create a thriving ecosystem for gamers and game developers but also to showcase the prowess of Made in India games on the global stage.The industry eagerly anticipates long-term clarity and a progressive taxation regime from the upcoming financial budget. This clarity is crucial for driving the next phase of growth, as it will not only provide a conducive environment for businesses but also revive investor confidence in the sector. A progressive taxation regime will further incentivize investment, leading to the creation of more job opportunities for our talented youth.Additionally, we are hopeful that the budget will pave the way for the establishment of dedicated courses in gaming. These courses will play a pivotal role in nurturing the next generation of game developers and professionals, ensuring a steady supply of skilled talent to fuel the industry's growth.I look forward to the upcoming financial budget with optimism, as we believe that the right policies and support from the government will propel the online skill gaming industry to greater heights, benefiting the economy in our march towards making India a $5 trillion economySarvjeet Virk, Co-founder & MD, FinvasiaAs we approach Budget 2024, we anticipate a continued focus on advancing India's digital public infrastructure, a key pillar for realizing the $5 trillion economy dream. I look forward to enhanced government initiatives fostering financial inclusion benefiting Bharat, not just India. On the tech front, I hope to see further progress in establishing AI Centres of Excellence. I also expect more policies to enable public-private partnership to boost end-use-cases of generative and predictive AI and increase its adoption in India. The fintech industry, as usual, will be the flag bearer of innovation. Government support, both in terms of policies and funding, will be instrumental in propelling the fintech sector to new heights of successAmit Jain, Founder, PaaduksAs Paaduks, a pioneering MSME sustainable footwear manufacturer, we eagerly anticipate the upcoming Interim Budget 2024 with hopeful optimism for the growth and sustenance of our industry. The MSME sector has been the backbone of our economy, and we look forward to policies that further support our growth, such as streamlined access to credit and incentives for innovation. Furthermore, Corporate tax reforms play a pivotal role in fostering a conducive business environment and enable businesses to reinvest in research and development, thereby promoting sustainable practices in our manufacturing processes.Sustainability is at the core of our ethos, and we hope for incentives to encourage eco-friendly practices within the industry, promoting a greener footprint. Export-oriented policies can further bolster our international reach, facilitating global recognition for Indian sustainable products. Moreover, Lifestyle-oriented incentives can enhance consumer awareness and preference for sustainable products, aligning with the global shift towards responsible consumerism.In conclusion, we look forward to an Interim Budget that not only acknowledges the significance of MSMEs but also fosters a holistic and sustainable ecosystem for the growth of businesses like ours.Given the rapid evolution of the digital landscape, we anticipate that the upcoming Union Budget 2024 will prioritize substantial investments in cybersecurity. The ever-growing threat landscape and the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks make allocating resources to bolstering cyber defense measures crucial. We hope to see a strong commitment from the government to enable collaboration between the public and private sectors as the government is opening many nationwide national infrastructure for private participation. This will help ensure India's digital infrastructure remain resilient and secure against emerging threats. Cybersecurity is not just an expenditure, but an investment in safeguarding our nation's digital future, and in today’s world of cyber threats, it’s non-negotiable. At Noventiq, we are proud to be part of this collaborative effort, and we are constantly innovating on our cybersecurity services and solutions through our Security Operations Centre (SoC). I believe that the best way to increase threat protection for client organizations is by investing in new technologies, such as AI and ML, while continuously modernising the processes. Our goal is to keep contributing to the defense against cybersecurity threats further strengthening the IT security sector.In the intricate tapestry of economic management, fiscal and monetary policies weave a crucial fabric. Governments employ fiscal measures, manipulating spending and taxation, while central banks wield monetary tools to steer the economy. The dichotomy of direct and indirect taxes adds nuances to revenue collection, impacting individuals and businesses. Inflation, a key economic barometer, can erode purchasing power, necessitating a delicate balance in policy formulation. Government fiscal health is encapsulated in deficit or surplus, mirroring the interplay of revenues and expenditures. The real estate realm anticipates a surge in 2024, yet the RBI's static repo rate hints at stable interest rates, although inflation's specter may alter this trajectory. Trade dynamics, foreign investments, and the annual Finance Bill further shape economic landscapes, epitomizing the intricate dance of policy and pragmatism.

The Union Budget for this fiscal placed a strong emphasis on capital expenditure (capex), earmarking nearly 4.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) to fund infrastructure. For sure, the infusion of funds came at the cost of trimming some welfare expenditure – or so it seemed.But given the growth imperative, the need to curtail the fiscal deficit and the resilience of the rural economy following fiscal support to welfare schemes afforded during the Covid-19 pandemic, it was only fair to pipe more funds for capex.Notably, the allocation to the three main employment-generation and asset-creation schemes — Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) — was 8.4% lower than the previous year’s spend.This decline reflected the government’s strategic move to divert funds from areas exhibiting strength towards those requiring additional support.The situation, however, has changed. The advance estimates indicate a considerable deceleration in growth of private consumption to 4.4% this fiscal from 7.5% last fiscal, with post-pandemic pent-up demand normalising and inflationary pressures (especially on food) hurting purchasing power.Of greater concern, though, is that high-frequency data suggests the rural economy, which has faced multiple blows to income, will account for much of the slowdown. To add, rural consumer price inflation has slightly outpaced overall inflation, at 5.6% so far, this fiscal.Against this backdrop, it will be interesting to see whether this year’s vote on account — and after the general elections, the full budget for fiscal 2025 — leans towards welfare or employment-generating schemes in a bid to stimulate rural demand.Another aspect to monitor is how the government strikes a balance between the need to support growth and the need to reduce the fiscal deficit to the targeted 4.5% of GDP by fiscal 2026 from the budgeted 5.9% for this fiscal.Staying put on the fiscal deficit glide path requires the government to temper its capex momentum, and this must commence next fiscal. A mix of revenue-enhancing measures (disinvestment and asset monetisation) and further rationalisation of revenue expenditure can assist in minimising the impact on capex.Will the capex cut entail a compromise on growth? Not necessarily, as the share of capex in GDP would remain higher than the pre-pandemic levels. A key assumption underlying this perspective is that the government’s capex spending so far, and its retreat now would pave the way for increased private investment.The budgeted effective capex stands at 4.5% of GDP this fiscal, compared with average capex of 2.7% over fiscals 2016-2020. Even if capex growth moderates considerably over fiscals 2025 and 2026, its share would still be close to 3.5% of GDP. In this analysis, we have considered effective capex, which includes capex and revenue grants-in-aid for creating capital assets.How this year’s pronouncements sustain continuity in policy and reform orientation will also bear watching. The past several budgets emphasised improvement of the growth narrative. Policy announcements and spending allocation were focused on easing the business conditions and improving the investment climate.The moves for next fiscal are expected to maintain continuity in policy setting, with emphasis on the Production Linked Incentive scheme and further upgradation of the transport infrastructure.Of course, a vote on account or the full budget is not the only avenue through which the government can make announcements. As long as expenditures under new announcements for next fiscal are managed within the ambit of the budget-announced accounts, alternative avenues may be utilised.Here, the macro backdrop demands attention.Last year, the Indian economy navigated numerous headwinds but showcased resilience. The GDP growth is estimated at 7% this fiscal, dipping only slightly from 7.3% last fiscal. Despite a surge in food prices, the overall consumer price inflation has softened this year, aided by lower global oil and commodity prices. Additionally, the external sector has displayed strength, with the rupee so far stronger against the US dollar relative to last fiscal.What helped?Global growth, initially anticipated to decelerate this year, will now slow in the next. Although India’s goods exports suffered this year, services exports provided support. Tighter domestic financial conditions were expected to hurt growth, but a relatively strong domestic demand momentum and credit push by banks and financial institutions kept credit demand high.Geopolitical tensions also introduced an element of uncertainty in the Indian economy, but their direct impact was limited on the typical channels of trade, capital flows and input costs.What hurt?Unfavourable weather conditions — ranging from the heatwave in April 2023 to the patchy rains between June and September 2023— affecting crops yields, reservoir levels, groundwater levels and rabi sowing. Consequently, the agriculture economy slowed — advance estimates indicate growth of 1.8% this fiscal, a significant slowdown from 4% last fiscal and the slowest in last eight years.The output of key crops such as rice, wheat, pulses, onions, tomatoes, and various spices declined, leading to a surge in their prices. Food inflation peaked at 11.5% in July 2023, with certain food categories witnessing even higher peaks. In response, the government introduced measures to increase supplies in the market, by releasing food stocks, curbing exports and facilitating imports. The government also extended its free food programme.Looking ahead to next fiscal, challenges loom and GDP growth is expected to slow. Global growth and the trade environment will be weaker than last year.Globally and in India, financial conditions will begin to gradually ease in the latter part of this year. However, peak tightening in the first half can impact credit demand. At the same time, tigher liquidity globally can hurt foreign investment flows into India (both portfolio and direct investment).Further, freak weather incidents are on the rise in terms of both frequency and intensity. These unpredictable shocks have the potential to alter the course of policymaking — both fiscal and monetary — if swift actions are required to shield the impact on incomes and purchasing power.Net-net, a balancing act will not be easy.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-three-things-to-watch-for-in-the-interim-budget/articleshow/107299798.cms

Interim Budget income tax changes unlikely?

Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Changes in income tax slabs , income tax rates, hike in standard deduction, Section 80C limit, more attractive new income tax regime - these are some of the top expectations of the common man and middle class from the Narendra Modi government’s Interim Union Budget 2024 .FM Nirmala Sitharaman will present Budget 2024 on February 1, 2024 as part of the Parliament’s Budget session.Ahead of the Union Budget 2024, Times of India Online surveyed 10 economists and experts on their major expectations from the budget.Asked whether there is a scope to provide income tax relief for the common man and middle class, the economists and experts were divided.DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor, EY India says that some relief on the personal income tax front is expected. “This could be in the form of a hike in Section 80C limits, income tax slab adjustments and a push to residential housing purchases or construction,” DK Srivastava told TOI.An economist at an industry body who did not wish to be named said there is scope to provide income tax relief. “Currently, under the new tax regime, incomes above Rs 15 lakhs are being covered under the highest tax slab. To boost private consumption expenditure, it is suggested that this threshold be raised to at least Rs 20 lakhs,” the economist said.Ranen Banerjee, Partner and Leader, Economic Advisory Services Government Sector Leader, PwC India believes that there is clearly a need for providing higher standard deductions. “This will help tax paying households cope with the inflationary increases. This could further incentivise people to move to the new tax regime,” he said.Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers states that the growth in personal income tax has been significant post pandemic and the increase in taxpayer base over the years shows the compliance measures are paying fruit. “As revenue collection growth remains strong owing to the robust economic performance and also higher collections of GST, the government may find space to increase the tax slab levels,” he said.Also Read | Budget 2024: Why standard deduction for salaried taxpayers needs to be hiked Hajra adds that the new income tax regime is viewed as disincentivizing savings as those deductions on investments available in the old tax regime do not apply to those who opted for the new tax regime. “In order to incentivize savings and also make the new tax regime attractive, certain savings and payments can be allowed towards deductions,” he told TOI.Yuvika Singhal, Economist at QuantEco Research believes that the government should aim to increase the acceptance of the new income tax regime.

Strategic Financial Boost

Why do we need to focus on Digital Marketing?

Looking at the world post COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that the travel industry has been one of the hardest-hit sectors. After the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic, we now find ourselves in the new normal, in the ever-evolving landscape of the global economy. The travel industry, in particular, has been actively finding ways to recuperate hard and fast.Now with the upcoming Union Budget , the travel industry finds itself in a very crucial junction.In less than two years, post pandemic, the travel industry has seen several initiatives, all aimed at faster recovery and revitalisation of the travel sector. One such refreshing initiative is digital marketing .Exclusively speaking to TOI on this, Pradeep Kumaar (Prady), CEO, NP Digital India shares, ""In anticipation of the Union Budget , we eagerly await support for the travel industry through enhanced digital marketing initiatives. A strategic financial boost can pave the way for innovative campaigns, online visibility, and customer engagement, vital for post-pandemic recovery. As the industry seeks to rebound, investing in digital strategies will be a catalyst for growth, enabling businesses to adapt, thrive, and contribute to the broader economic resurgence. We look forward to a budget that recognises the pivotal role of digital marketing in revitalising the travel sector and propelling it towards a resilient and prosperous future.""In the Union Budget, a strategic financial boost for the travel industry can make a significant difference in its recovery journey. A lot of help in the form of allocating funds specifically for digital marketing initiatives will most definitely empower businesses to adapt to the changing landscape and connect with their audiences effectively. With the financial support, businesses can launch targeted campaigns more efficiently, increase their social media presence, and implement better and more effective search engine optimisation (SEO) strategies for better online visibility.A budget that acknowledges the transformative power of digital strategies will not only facilitate the travel sector's quick recovery but also pave the way for a sustained growth in the days to come.Digital marketing has emerged as a cost-effective and efficient means of reaching target audiences. Especially for the travel sector, a well-executed digital marketing strategy only means growth, and a sustainable one at that. From business campaigns to customer engagement, there is very little that an efficient digital marketing does not cover. As the travel industry steadily moves towards recuperation, investing in digital strategies is one of the smartest ways to go about.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/union-budget-2024-boosting-the-travel-industry-with-digital-marketing-initiatives/articleshow/107284391.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Can India fill the vacuum created in global supply chains?,"Substantial investments in clean energy are imperative. The government’s allocation of Rs 35,000 crore for priority capital investments (in the previous budget towards India’s energy transition) aligns with the net-zero objectives. A higher capex spending by the government is expected to crowd capital spending towards clean energy technologies. This strategic shift is fundamental to fostering green funding and supports the production and storage of green electricity facilitated by the 30 critical minerals identified by the Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP). Critical minerals, such as cobalt, molybdenum, and nickel are essential in clean technology value chains and require substantial R&D for further exploration. This proactive approach is vital for considering the projected collective reserve requirement of about 200 KT by 2040. An emphasis on value-added manufacturing is significant. India’s GVC journey has seen a shift from contributing 47.6 percent to total exports before 2008 to 39 percent by 2022. Notable improvements have been made in medium- to high-tech manufacturing sectors, such as chemicals, electrical machinery, and industrial equipment. Augmenting backward linkages in key industries, such as electronics, industrial equipment, electrical machinery, telecom, and automobiles, is essential to enhance domestic value addition. Mitigating the risks associated with capital flows to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) is critical. Introducing credit guarantees and insurance schemes tailored for sectors such as automotive, electronics and industrial machinery can address substantial credit gaps, thereby bolstering the competitiveness of these entities. A considerable focus on technology R&D is paramount. Elevating R&D investment to 1.5 percent of GDP is essential to expedite exploration, optimise resource efficiency, promote recycling initiatives, and undertake substitute research. A comprehensive national R&D policy will attract private investments, especially benefitting MSMEs striving to match the capabilities of suppliers from other Asian countries.

India stands at the threshold of an unprecedented opportunity in global manufacturing exports. It is in a pivotal moment characterised by evolving global dynamics and ambitious domestic initiatives. The convergence of burgeoning infrastructure development, including initiatives such as the National Logistics Policy and the Gati Shakti Scheme, has positioned India favourably in the eyes of global manufacturing giants seeking alternative production and sourcing destinations.Forecasts signal a robust annual GDP growth ranging between 6 percent and 8 percent over the next 5–6 years, projecting India’s GDP to rise to $6 trillion (by the end of FY30). This confluence presents a critical juncture for India to reinforce its participation in the Global Value Chains (GVC), in sectors such as electronics, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, automotive, specialty chemicals, and industrial products.However, India must strike a delicate balance between this promising scenario and capitalise on these opportunities to emerge as a hub for global supply chains and tackle multifaceted challenges to sustainable growth.In line with the sustainability commitments of developed nations (as outlined in the Paris Agreement), India, as a developing nation, faces the challenge of meeting its clean energy requirements to power its industries. Despite the recent milestones in energy, fulfilling a peak demand of 240 GW (a significant reliance on thermal power stations fuelled by coal) underscores the need for cleaner energy sources. India’s G20 presidency emphasises a green development pact, highlighting the centrality of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in global actions and policies.In the current geopolitical situation, a vacuum is created in the global supply chains that India is trying to fill. The Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme is anticipated to drive advancements across key sectors. To use the shift in global supply chains effectively and enhance its competitiveness, India needs to focus on the following four critical initiatives in the upcoming budget:The imminent budget is expected to direct its attention to the above pivotal areas. Despite a decline in the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in certain manufacturing sectors, an upsurge of FDI in segments such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, and food processing is seen. Strengthening regulatory frameworks and augmenting budget allocations in these sectors can further incentivise FDI inflows, bolstering India as an attractive manufacturing destination.Addressing these fundamental areas will fortify India’s competitive edge in the global manufacturing arena, ensuring sustained growth, fostering innovation, and securing a more pronounced role in global value chains. These strategic policies will position India favourably in the upcoming union budget to seize the unfolding opportunities amidst the crises in the global supply chain Easwaran Subramanian, Partner and Supply Chain Leader, Deloitte India and Kathir Thandavarayan, Partner, Consulting, Deloitte India.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/budget-2024-can-india-fill-the-vacuum-created-in-global-supply-chains/articleshow/107280176.cms

A holistic ecosystem focussing on academic collaborations, AI councils and preference to startups in government tenders will bolster the growth of the sector.” Kothari said, India needs to create a talent pool for deep technology companies and reduce dependency on traditional IT services to become a sustainable and viable future business.Industry players expect the government to roll out incentives to assist industries, especially small and mid-sized players, to adopt cybersecurity.Shreyas Dighe, co-founder of a cybersecurity-domain startup based in Indore said, “With the recent data protection act in-place, we expect some kind of schemes or incentives in this budget to encourage adoption of cybersecurity services and solutions. This also helps create a shield against cyber attacks. Prioritised funding / schemes for these sectors could help bolster the security postures through robust frameworks.”Startups expect the Union Budget to announce measures to handhold budding entrepreneurs and lower compliance burden.Another firm director Mayur Sethi said, “Tax exemptions are crucial, offering financial relief and encouraging innovation. A dedicated budget for new startups is essential, providing the necessary resources for growth and development. Additionally, favourable tax policies for artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and internet of things would fuel advancements in these critical sectors, supporting technological innovation.”Firms also advocated extending tax benefits and quick refunds to export oriented firms.Sawan Laddha, secretary of a company said, “Government should look into the challenges faced by startups especially export oriented units like availing the input tax credit and refunds of GST. The benefits of the CGTMSE scheme limit should be increased and the GST refund process needs to be expedited.” Startups said the government needs to address challenges for starting ventures in small towns and extend additional benefits in smaller cities. CEO of a firm Vamsi Krishna said, “Making regulatory processes easier to start a venture and offering faster clearances will encourage more entrepreneurs to launch their ventures. Such schemes and environment should be also extended to tier 2 and tier 3 cities. This budget should address credit challenges faced by entrepreneurs.

Budget 2024 : In the upcoming budget for 2024-25, the government plans to increase dividend earnings significantly, targeting about Rs 70,000 crore from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and financial institutions (FIs). According to PTI, this comes after a successful financial year with higher-than-expected dividends from the RBI.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the interim Budget in the Lok Sabha on February 1.Sources suggest that the government aims to surpass the estimated dividend of Rs 48,000 crore from financial institutions in the current fiscal year .The RBI's dividend payment for the current financial year has exceeded expectations, reaching Rs 87,416 crore. With the favourable performance of public sector banks and financial institutions in recent quarterly reports, there is an expectation that their dividend payouts in the next fiscal year will surpass the current year's figures.According to sources, a reasonable expectation is that the government will receive approximately Rs 70,000 crore as dividends from the RBI and financial institutions in the fiscal year 2024-25. In the Union Budget for 2023-24, the government had set a 17% higher dividend target at Rs 48,000 crore from the RBI, public sector banks, and financial institutions, and this target has been comfortably exceeded.But this target was greatly exceeded when the Reserve Bank transferred a surplus of Rs 87,416 crore to the central government for the fiscal year 2022-23.The surplus transfer of Rs 87,416.22 crore by the Reserve Bank during 2023-24 significantly exceeded both the previous year's amount (Rs 30,307.45 crore) and the budgeted amount of Rs 48,000 crore for Dividend/Surplus transfer. In the preceding fiscal year, the government had collected Rs 40,953 crore from the RBI and public sector financial institutions.The significant rise in dividends from banks and financial institutions, along with increased tax collections, is anticipated to help the government follow a fiscal deficit reduction plan. The government's goal is to decrease the fiscal deficit to under 4.5% by 2025-26, down from the estimated 5.9% of GDP in 2023-24, as outlined in the fiscal consolidation roadmap.

Ahead of the Budget session of Parliament , Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has urged the central government to allocate an All India Institute of Medical Science ( AIIMS ) in Raichur Following a request put forth by Karnataka Minister NS Boseraju, the chief minister penned a letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.On January 25, Karnataka's Minister of Minor Irrigation, Science, and Technology, NS Boseraju, formally petitioned the chief minister, seeking the establishment of AIIMS in Raichur.""This demand aligns with our manifesto commitment and is a reflection of the aspirations of the people of the district. Raichur has witnessed a persistent 625-day-long Satyagraha led by various organizations and advocacy groups, emphasizing the crucial need for AIIMS in the region,"" the state government said in a release on Tuesday.Recognized as an aspirational district by the central government, Raichur holds special significance under Article 371(J) of the Constitution, whichThe state government said it had earlier, on two occasions--June and September 2023--addressed the Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, underscoring the criticality of AIIMS for Raichur.""In these communications, emphasis was placed on urging the Finance Minister of the Union Government to accord due consideration to this matter ahead of the 2024-25 Union Budget,"" the release added.Meanwhile, the Budget Session will commence with the address of President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday and subject to the exigencies of government business, the session may conclude on February 9.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the interim Union Budget on Thursday.The interim budget typically takes care of the fiscal needs of the intervening period until a government is formed after the Lok Sabha polls.Earlier today, an all-party meeting, chaired by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, was convened ahead of the Budget Session of Parliament.

indiatimes.com,Interim Budget 2024: MSMEs demand FM’s attention to resolve bank loan ratings system issues,"The MSME sector in India, which accounts for 30% of the country’s GDP and 50% of exports, wants the government to address an “unease in banking” for small businesses.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should resolve this issue in the interim budget , says the Federation of Indian Micro and Small & Medium Enterprises (FISME).Anil Bhardwaj, secretary-general of the federation, says the bank ombudsman scheme is ineffective and appears to favour the lenders over the customer. A big weakness is that it does not make it mandatory for the ombudsman to deliver reasoned or speaking orders. Because of this, most cases are just dismissed or decided arbitrarily without giving reasons, he says.FISME also highlights that banks levy a foreclosure charge on loan prepayment or when a borrower wishes to switch banks because of unsatisfactory services. These charges, ranging from 2-4%, contradict the RBI’s Code for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSE), which advises against such penalties, says Bhardwaj.Another industry’s pain point pertains to the application of bank loan ratings (BLR). If the exposure of banks to an MSME account is beyond a threshold, banks insist on getting a third party rating known as BLR from RBI or SEBI-approved rating agencies. The trouble is that historically, these rating agencies were brought in to rate listed companies and assign A,B,C type of ratings. The same agencies were suddenly mandated to rate MSMEs for short-term “solvency” with the same set of formats.The results have been disastrous, says Bhardwaj of FISME. Hardly any MSME got investment grade rating, which means higher interest rates and demand for additional collateral security. “In RBI’s own admission, BLR rating was not meant to be a permanent policy but a stopgap arrangement in 2007 until banks developed their own robust risk assessment models. It’s time the BLR ratings are junked. Almost all MSMEs feel exploited by rating agencies,” Bhardwaj says, requesting the FM to address this in the budget.It is estimated that the size of public procurement in India is almost one third of its GDP — close to $1 trillion. For MSMEs, it assumes even greater importance because the central government mandates 25% procurement from the small businesses. MSMEs taking part in such procurement are required to furnish bank guarantees (BGs), performance guarantees. Banks charge huge sums for such service from MSMEs. This locks up valuable working capital for the small companies.FISME says it has consistently highlighted the global practice of furnishing BGs through insurance companies, which neither insist on margin money nor demand collateral security but charge for usage period. Notably, the finance minister announced the option of replacing BGs with insurance surety in the Union Budget in 2022. However, this is restricted to NHAI projects only. FISME wants a clear road map for MSMEs to get this facility.Home Textile Exporters Welfare Association (HEWA) sees the upcoming budget as an opportunity for the FM to increase the export promotion budget for textiles, so that more companies can participate in international events. “In a major global fair, we found only 170 Indian companies, compared to China’s 1,500,” says Vikas Singh Chauhan, Director, Home Textile Exporters Welfare Association (HEWA).He suggests the government establish “India marts” in public-private partnership modes at leading geographies. The same model brings a huge difference in China’s share of global trade presence, he says. “We propose a PLI-like scheme for micro and small firms with an investment cap of Rs 10 crore, focusing on specific clusters. We also request an increase in the interest subvention scheme subsidy from 2% to 5%, applicable to both manufacturer and merchant exporters. The government should also expand the Shipping Corporation of India to create a global shipping presence, breaking the monopoly of larger shipping lines,” adds Chauhan.MSMEs are vital to generate employment for blue-collar workers. But there is a mismatch in availability and requirement of blue-collar skills, says think tank CUTS International.Pradeep Mehta, the Secretary-General of CUTS International, emphasises that the budget should prioritise the right kind of employment — focussing not only on job quantity but also on ensuring the provision of good and better jobs for the masses.Another challenge that Mehta wants the upcoming budget to address is the lack of environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-related support for MSMEs. He says ESG is critical for the integration of MSMEs in both global value chains (GVCs) and regional value chains (RVCs). “MSMEs are increasingly acknowledging the significance of ESG considerations. However, they need more policy support to ease the compliance burden associated with ESG practices. From an Indian standpoint, ESG investing is still in the early stages. Therefore, the FM should look at establishing a specific framework designed for implementing ESG by MSMEs,” says Mehta.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/interim-budget-2024-msmes-demand-fms-attention-to-resolve-bank-loan-ratings-system-issues/articleshow/107251980.cms

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. This year, it will be an interim budget as Lok Sabha elections are scheduled this year. AI technology and its implications in various fields dominated 2023, and tech companies in this space are hopeful that this year’s Union Budget will prioritise measures that foster the development as well as widespread adoption of the technology.Talking about the use of AI in curbing hacking incidents, Sunil Sharma, vice president of sales, Sophos India & SAARC, said that the budget hopefully will include a focus on reinforcing the nation's cyber defences.“Over the past year, India has witnessed a rise in cyber-attacks of various magnitudes, placing many businesses and individuals at risk. In the wake of these attacks and the Finance Ministry's directives throughout 2023 to enhance cybersecurity measures in different industries, hopefully, the upcoming interim Union Budget 2024 will include a continued focus on reinforcing the nation's cyber defences. With a heightened emphasis on the prevention of data breaches, ransomware attacks and AI-powered cyber threats, increased budgetary allocations towards cybersecurity awareness and training initiatives are imperative. The Finance Minister's call for proactive cybersecurity measures augur well for a renewed focus on bridging the current cybersecurity skill gap in the industry, fostering an efficient cyber-task force within organisations. This strategic investment will not only fortify our defence against cyber threats but also contribute to job creation and economic resilience in the face of evolving digital challenges, powering the future of a secure Digital India,” Sharma said.""The AI push by Honourable Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in last year’s Budget was a visionary step which has helped place the country on the global AI map. We are hopeful that the upcoming Interim Union Budget 2024 will continue this momentum. The strides being made through initiatives like ‘ AI for India ' set the stage for the nation to lead the ongoing technology transformation. What is also equally important is to safeguard the data required for this push towards an AI-driven nation. We look forward to diligent data governance and intelligent data infrastructure driven by AI. The budget presents an opportunity to streamline data access and address concerns on ethics,” said Puneet Gupta, vice president and managing director, NetApp India/SAARC.“In the upcoming budget, I would like to see the government prioritising measures that foster the development and widespread adoption of AI. A strategic investment in AI initiatives will not only drive economic growth but also position our country as a global leader in the digital era. I look forward to policies that support research and development, incentivise AI talent, and create a conducive environment for businesses to harness the full potential of AI. By leveraging AI, we can build a smarter, more competitive, and technologically advanced nation,” added Kunal Nagarkatti, CEO, Clover Infotech.“In light of India’s rapid strides in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence throughout 2023, the upcoming interim Union Budget could hold the key to unlocking the full potential of this transformative technology for enterprises across the nation,” said Rajesh Sinha, founder and chairman, Fulcrum Digital.“We are hopeful that the interim budget makes provisions for investments in data infrastructure, skill development, and data accessibility. This will ensure that India not only catches up with global AI leaders but emerges as a front-runner in responsible AI adoption. The government’s vision and its successful implementation in the form of this Union Budget is set to fuel the trajectory of yet another year of rapid digital advancement for the country,” he said.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/union-budget-202425-investment-provisions-in-ai-for-india/articleshow/107260943.cms

As the government lays out its financial roadmap, understanding concepts like Fiscal Deficit , Revenue Expenditure , and Skill Development Budget becomes paramount. These terms not only provide insights into the economic health of the nation but also hold the key to gauging the government's priorities and strategies for the upcoming fiscal year.The Union Budget is more than just a financial statement; it's a blueprint that shapes the economic landscape. As students navigate the intricacies of fiscal policies and financial jargon, a foundational understanding of these ten terms will empower them to decode the government's financial priorities and assess their impact on the broader economic framework.

A lower fiscal deficit is generally considered good for the economy.This refers to the gap between the government's revenue from taxes and other sources and its non-capital expenditure. In simple terms, it's how much money the government falls short of even after collecting taxes to meet its regular expenses. A lower revenue deficit is generally considered good for the economy.This is the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given year. It's a broad measure of the economy's size and health. A growing GDP is generally considered good for the economy.This refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.

The Rationale Behind the 6% Demand

The Current Reality: A Stark Contrast

Major Roadblocks to Achieving the 6% Target

Moving Forward: A Collaborative Approach

As the interim Union Budget 2024-25 approaches, expectations in the education sector are heightened, anticipating transformative initiatives. From primary education to higher studies, the sector eagerly awaits measures to address challenges such as skill development , international exposure, and aligning educational standards with global benchmarks.The renewed call to boost the budgetary allocation from the current 2.9% to 6% gains momentum once more.Experts and industry leaders stress the urgency for the government to prioritize education reforms , ensuring young talent is equipped with the necessary skills and qualifications for success in both national and international job markets.As India strides forward on the path of economic growth and development, the imperative to invest in its future workforce becomes more pronounced. Education plays a pivotal role in shaping the skills, knowledge, and values of young minds, exerting a profound influence on the nation's trajectory. In this light, the call for allocating 6% of the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) to the education sector has garnered substantial momentum.The 6% GDP allocation to education is not a new concept. It was first recommended in the National Policy on Education (NPE) of 1968, reiterated in the 1986 NPE, and most recently emphasized in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. This persistent demand stems from a clear understanding of the numerous benefits that accrue from adequate education funding:• Improved Learning Outcomes: Increased investment translates into better infrastructure, resources, and teacher training, ultimately leading to enhanced learning experiences and outcomes for students.• Enhanced Equity and Access: Adequate funding can bridge the gap between disadvantaged and privileged communities, ensuring equitable access to quality education for all.• Holistic Development: A well-funded education system can foster not just cognitive skills but also critical thinking, creativity, and social-emotional well-being, nurturing well-rounded individuals.• Skilled Workforce for the Future: By equipping students with relevant skills and knowledge, the education sector can prepare them for the demands of the evolving job market, contributing to India's economic competitiveness.Despite the compelling arguments for increased funding, the current reality paints a different picture. India's expenditure on education hovers around 3% of GDP, falling short of the recommended 6% by a significant margin. This underinvestment manifests in various challenges:• Teacher Vacancies and Inadequate Training: The education system grapples with a shortage of qualified teachers, further exacerbated by insufficient training opportunities.• Overcrowded Classrooms and Limited Infrastructure: Many schools struggle with overcrowded classrooms and lack essential infrastructure, hindering effective learning.• Digital Divide and Unequal Access: The digital divide poses a significant challenge, with limited access to technology and internet connectivity further marginalizing disadvantaged students.Bridging the gap between the current scenario and the 6% target requires overcoming several hurdles:• Competing Priorities: Education often competes with other sectors for budgetary allocation, making it challenging to secure the desired increase.• Inefficient Utilization of Funds: Concerns regarding leakages and inefficient use of allocated funds necessitate robust accountability mechanisms.• Political Will and Public Support: Sustained political will and public support are crucial to advocate for increased funding and ensure its effective utilization.Achieving the 6% target necessitates a multi-pronged approach:• Increased Government Allocation: The government must demonstrate a strong commitment to education by gradually increasing budgetary allocations towards the 6% target.• Focus on Effective Utilization: Robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are essential to ensure that allocated funds are used efficiently and transparently.• Public-Private Partnerships: Collaborations with the private sector can leverage their expertise and resources to improve infrastructure, develop curriculum, and enhance teacher training.• Community Engagement: Engaging communities in education governance and decision-making can foster ownership and ensure accountability.Investing in education is not just an expenditure; it's an investment in India's future. By prioritizing the 6% GDP allocation and addressing the existing challenges, the nation can empower its young minds to become active participants and leaders in shaping a brighter tomorrow.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-union-budget-202425-the-need-for-6-of-gdp-in-the-indian-education-sector-major-roadblocks-and-more/articleshow/107233546.cms

indiatimes.com,budget: Bharatiya Chai Parishad pins hope on Interim Budget 2024 to seeks export promotion policy for tea industry,"Ahead of the Union interim budget 2024, Nalin Khemani, Chairman of Bharatiya Chai Parishad said that the tea industry in Assam needs proper promotion, particularly overseas, so that it can tap new markets and expected Tea Board to introduce a tea promotion policy. The Budget session of Parliament, the last session before the general elections expected in April-May, will begin on January 31 and is likely to continue till February 9, sources had said. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the interim budget on February 1. The session will begin with President Droupadi Murmu's address to the joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament.“Subsidies cannot help an industry if it wants to be self-sustainable... If the govt. could take over our burden of social costs like hospitals and schools, it will greatly reduce the burden of industry and prove to be a win-win situation for the management as well as the workers... As far as the Union Budget is concerned, the Commerce Ministry needs to ensure that our exports are increased... There is an oversupply of tea in the domestic market. If the government introduces a tea promotion policy through the Tea Board, and we step into new markets even outside the country, this will definitely help the tea industry... Both the Central as well as the state governments are serious about the tea industry, so we are hoping for the best.” India, with a share of 11 per cent, is the fourth-largest tea exporter after China, Kenya, and Sri Lanka.India as a whole contributes 23 per cent to the global tea output and employs around 1.2 million workers in the tea plantation sector.

Investors have been prudent to lock-in profits in stocks that they hold as they understand well that markets shall be highly volatile around the Union Budget 2024 session,, Senior Vice President-Equity, Commodity & Currency atsaid. Overall, markets needed a trigger to correct ahead of the budget and HDFC Bank provided the same, Singh opined.Markets continue to trade with a negative bias for the past couple of weeks, on the back of a sell-off and profit booking witnessed ahead of the Union Budget. Investors have been prudent to lock-in profits in stocks that they hold as they understand well that markets shall be highly volatile around the Union Budget 2024 session.Global cues have been overall positive, lower crude prices and optimism over expectations of a US Fed rate cut in March along with steps taken by China, to shore up its economy, have supported global markets. However, we have witnessed FII selling last week, as well, dampening the overall investor sentiments. But these were on expected lines, as this being a budget week, we are expected to witness increased volatility , hence traders and investors alike, are most likely to keep lighter positions till clarity emerges as to the outcome of the budget and its overall likely impact on the economy.Nifty lost over 1% WoW, whereas Bank Nifty lost over 2.5% WoW, clearly reflecting the fact that it was the Bank Nifty, and there also, HDFC Bank, with the highest weightage in Nifty (13%) & Bank Nifty (30%), lost around 3% WoW, leading to a crack in both the major indices.Overall, markets needed a trigger to correct ahead of the budget and HDFC Bank provided the same. The levels to watch out for Nifty on the downside, is support around the 21,000-21,100 zone whereas resistance is seen around the 21,600-21,700 zone.For Bank Nifty, support is seen around the 43,500-44,000 zone whereas resistance is seen around the 46300-46500. It is advisable to trade with caution as enhanced volatility would be witnessed in the week, as it being a Budget week.Primarily, the sharp correction in HDFC Bank led to the overall bearish sentiments in the banking space last week with HDFC Bank losing almost 16% in January alone, clearly highlighting the disillusionment amongst investors over the future outlook of the bank.HDFC Bank has strong support around the 1,350-1,400 zone, where buying could emerge, whereas resistance is seen around the 1,570-1,600 zone. Those invested in HDFC Bank, should look at the investment from a longer-term perspective and exiting around crucial support zone, should be avoided.PSU banks, majority of them, have delivered superior returns in January, with Union Bank, Bank of India and Bank of Maharashtra, posting double digit returns. Overall, the PSU Banking space outperformed most of the other sectors as investor interest over the past couple of months, has shifted towards PSU stocks, be it banking, railways, power, mining, to name a few.Overall, investors would be cautious ahead of SBI quarterly earnings report, given the performance of HDFC Bank, with crucial support for SBI seen around the 550 level whereas resistance is seen around the 660 zone.Ahead of the general elections, markets expectations continue to remain mixed, as most likely, this could be an interim budget, with focus expected on enhancing spending in the infrastructure, job creation, tax exemptions for the salaried class as well as the corporate, tax sops for sectors in the green space, incentives for manufacturing sector along with sops for the exporters.It would be interesting to watch the deliverables in this budget, as hopes run high in a few quarters, whereas to a large extent, remain uncertain as to the outcome of the budget. You never know, it might also turn out to be a populist one, just ahead of the crucial elections.Oracle has gained almost 60%, NBCC is up 40% whereas RITES is up 36% in January itself, offering investors superlative returns in such short span of time. Whereas on one hand, Oracle & RITES trade at record highs, NBCC is still far from its all-time high of 145, witnessed in November 2017. Investors in these particular counters should look at booking part profit and trail the balance as the uptrend in all these three stocks, continues to remain strong.On the other hand, ZEE was down almost 30% last week, post the news of calling-off the merger with Sony, Tanla corrected by 12% WoW, and Oberoi Realty, corrected by 13% last week. Zee is now being affected purely by news flows, so its best to be cautious in this stock, whereas in the case of Tanla, it is likely to trade in a range of 900-1200, with upside remaining capped. Oberoi realty appears to have formed a short-term top, with crucial support seen around the 1200 mark, so investors should look at exiting their positions as and when they identify such opportunities.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: The indirect tax changes the government should look to introduce,"Keeping in mind India’s steady economic growth and the focused impetus shown towards the indigenous manufacturing, it is expected that in Budget 2024-25, the Government’s attention would remain consistent with policies aiming towards incentivising domestic manufacturing, maintaining stability, sustaining the demand and generating employment opportunities in line with the objective of making India “Atmanirbhar”.Taxation plays a pivotal role in economic growth of the country and the Indian industry expects announcement of various measures such as allocating of larger funds for infrastructure development, focus on social sector schemes, relief on taxation, etc.From the advent of GST , the Government has time and again tried to iron out the complexities, compliance hiccups and anomalies with respect to various issues, however, there are still plethora of issues on which industry seeks government intervention.One of the most important features of GST is to boost the competitiveness of businesses by ensuring the free flow of input tax credits (ITC) across the value chain. Restaurants presently operating at 5% without ITC have encountered reduction in operating margins since they are unable to recover the entire ITC cost from the customers which makes them less competitive. The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) has also requested the Government to restore ITC to the restaurants while increasing the rate of GST applicable on supply of restaurant services from 5% to 12%.Similarly, the pharma industry awaits relief with respect to ITC reversal on destruction of expired goods and free samples provided to doctors. Under GST, ITC is required to be reversed upon destruction, loss, disposal by way of gift or free samples or writing off goods. It is a general practice that Pharma companies provide samples to doctors and also required to dispose of the expired medicines as per regulatory requirement as the same are not fit for human consumption.Reversal of ITC on destruction of goods and distribution of samples increases the operating cost of the Pharma companies and thus, it is expected that government should exempt Pharma industry reversal of ITC on samples and expired goods. It is important that the government should bring the GST provisions in line with the prevailing trade practices and regulations imposed under other statutes.Currently, the income from medical tourism, are also treated as exempt services, despite the hospitals recovering its charges in foreign exchange. However, such revenue should be treated as a zero- rated revenue (i.e. export of services), so that the hospitals can claim ITC on various expenses incurred and claim refund of such ITC.In India the Government has shown clear focus in pushing use of Electric Vehicles (EV) and has accordingly kept the GST rate on EV at 5%. However, EV manufacturers are paying GST@18% on purchase of lithium batteries and spare parts which consequently increases the cost of manufacturing the EVs and thus, making it less affordable. With higher cost, the demand of EVs is less as compared to what was expected and thus, EV industry is expecting the government to rationalise the GST rates on lithium batteries and spare parts from 18% to 5% to meet government’s objective.The inclusion of diesel under the GST ambit is a significant move that is expected from the Government in this budget. With India aiming to reduce its logistics costs and become more competitive in the international market, inclusion of diesel within the GST framework will benefit the logistics players to control costs by cutting on the tax outflow.From the customs front also, the industry expects some amendments by the Union Budget. Vide the Finance Act, 2023, an amendment was made in the Manufacture and Other Operations in Warehouse Regulations (MOOWR) scheme in terms of which IGST and Compensation Cess was required to be paid upfront at the time of import of goods. This IGST and Compensation Cess are creditable and can be used for payment of output tax liability at the time of supply of finished goods. The industry and made various representations to the Government requesting to re-look at this amendment. The proposed change (this amendment has not yet been notified) will lead to blockage of the working capital till the finished goods are sold, which consequently will also make the scheme unattractive as only partial duty has been deferred. It is important to be noted that Duty deferment on import of capital goods and inputs was one of the major advantages provided under the MOOWR scheme. Thus, it is expected that the same should be kept in abeyance to keep the scheme attractive.The government in the past has introduced amnesty scheme for service tax and central excise matters however, no such measures have been taken for customs pending litigations till date. It is expected that steps are taken to introduce amnesty scheme under customs laws to close the long-drawn litigations that is pending before the courts. This will not only help to cut down the burden of the judicial forums but will also help the taxpayer to get rid of the past disputes and move ahead litigation free.Since this will be an interim budget, there is not much expectation for major announcements before the elections.

Having reaped rich dividends from the Reserve Bank in the current financial year, the government will be looking forward to receiving about Rs 70,000 crore from the central bank and the financial institutions (FIs) in the next financial year. In the interim Budget to be unveiled in the Lok Sabha on February 1 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, sources said, the government would peg receipts from dividends from financial institutions at much higher level than Rs 48,000 crore estimated for the current fiscal.The current financial year estimate has already exceeded the Budget target as RBI paid a dividend of Rs 87,416 crore.With public sector banks and financial institutions posting good quarterly numbers during the current financial year, the dividend payout by them in the coming year would be higher compared to this year.So, it would be feasible to expect about Rs 70,000 crore as dividend payout from RBI and financial institutions in FY'25, sources said.The government had pegged a 17 per cent higher dividend at Rs 48,000 crore from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), public sector banks and financial institutions in 2023-24.However, this target was very much surpassed with the transfer of Rs 87,416 crore as surplus to the central government for 2022-23 by the Reserve Bank.During 2023-24, the Reserve Bank transferred a surplus of Rs 87,416.22 crore to the central government which is higher than both the amount transferred last year (Rs 30,307.45 crore) and the budgeted amount under Dividend/Surplus transfer of Reserve Bank of India, Nationalised Banks and Financial Institutions in the Union Budget 2023-24 (Rs 48,000 crore).In the previous financial year, the government mobilised Rs 40,953 crore from RBI and public sector financial institutions.The higher dividend from banks and financial institutions, apart from higher tax mobilisation, would help achieve a fiscal deficit glide path.As per the fiscal consolidation roadmap, the government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 4.5 per cent by 2025-26 from an estimated 5.9 per cent of GDP in 2023-24.The government, as per the roadmap, is required to bring down the fiscal deficit to 5.4 per cent in the next financial year beginning April 1, 2024.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/budget-2024-government-may-set-higher-dividend-target-at-rs-70000-crore-from-rbi-banks-and-fis/articleshow/107236146.cms

Anticipations surround the Interim Budget 2024 , with experts expecting a heightened focus on the education sector. Given the pivotal role of AI-based technology, there is a collective call for substantial investments, a progressive policy framework, and augmented R&D expenditure. To keep pace with global advancements, there's also a consensus to fortify the ongoing NIPUN Bharat initiative for foundational skills in early education.Additionally, the wish lists of experts include increased allocations for Skill Education and support for doctoral scholars across disciplines, fostering a comprehensive approach to educational development. Read on to know what they expect from the Union Budget 2024 .A country's socio-economic landscape is greatly influenced by its academic and innovation environment, and India will be no exception. I urge the Government to allocate significant funding for this sector in the upcoming Union Budget, 2024–2025. AI-based technology has been a major driver in recent months and the trend will only accelerate. A call for heavy investments, a progressive policy framework, and increased R&D expenditure is clearly needed for India to catch up with the world in these areas. The government's role is pivotal in fostering an ecosystem that fuels AI innovation, bringing academia, industry, NGOs, and government departments together. As we envision a future powered by AI, India's investment must not only be monetary but also strategic, facilitating collaborative synergies for a thriving ecosystem.The wealthiest internet-rich firms have invested billions of dollars in the most successful AI startups, like ChatGPT, Gemini, LLaMA, and others. Regretfully, there isn't an Indian business with a comparable scale or emphasis to support our ecosystem. In India, the government's involvement and framing of relevant policies are therefore becoming increasingly crucial in Make AI in India. To make it happen, the government should invest heavily, establish enabling mechanisms for rapid growth, and step aside to bring in the required agility to the process.There are three main points of action. First, continue and strengthen the ongoing energetic NIPUN Bharat implementation for building foundational skills in early grades. Secondly, enable ‘catch up’ in basic reading and arithmetic skills for those children in elementary grades (Grade 3 to 8) who need additional learning support. Thirdly, from the current base of digital skills, build further digital capability for secondary school students that can help them in ‘learning for school’, ‘learning for life’ and ‘learning for work’.I hope we build on the momentum of increased funding in the education sector even this year. It's crucial to create inclusive and accessible opportunities for young people. This would entail more targeted investment in implementing career guidance guidelines and vocational education on the lines of NEP along with promotion of 21st-century skills which will be instrumental for youth. We also foresee greater awareness on mental health for young people through policy and advocacy. In essence, we are looking at monumental shifts in the Indian landscape with more educated and skilled youth entering the workforce.I wish greater allocation for Skill Education and Doctoral scholars in all disciplines. I would also expect that existing universities at the state and centre are allocated budgets with accountability for high tech research centres. Vacancies at all levels in universities must be filled for efficient functioning. Lastly and most importantly, an adequate budget should be allocated for digital transformation of universities.Budget 2024 is expected to certainly highlight progress in education and allocate funding to a headline target that aligns with the manifesto. But the main thrust in the past two years in education has been on using the annual allocations better as the system activates the backend structures that align with the New Education Policy. We are unlikely to see big numbers, but a smart budget speech should include three elements. These include at least one initiative, a listing of progress for ongoing funded programmes and further support for an aspirational long-term programme. In addition, Girls Education in aspirational districts, Foundational and Integrated Skill-based Learning, Internationalisation and Institutional capacity in Higher Education are most likely to be received with applause.Over the past many years, particularly post COVID-19, it has been evident that although budget allocations are made for very valuable interventions, a large number of them do not come to fruition for a host of reasons. In the interest of efficiency, there is probably a need to step back, look at all the schemes in play and rationalise and consolidate them for the most efficient use of budgetary provisions. With so many moving pieces, there is a need to triangulate at the backend to identify duplication, overlaps and half-finished schemes. This will ensure prioritisation of budget allocations and the most valuable usage of the education budget.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-2024-wish-list-what-do-experts-expect-for-the-education-sector/articleshow/107237885.cms

Government's commitment to fiscal consolidation. Since the Government has committed to target a 4.5% fiscal deficit by FY26, the bond market will be keenly looking at consolidation from 5.9% in FY24. Continuation of capex expenditure. The government has focused on raising capex spending & market participants will look at the government to continue the same. Credible revenue & expenditure assumptions Market borrowing

The finance minister is going to present the interim budget in an hour. According to pundits, the government is unlikely to announce any major policy decisions now as the election is only a few months away. Investors will have to wait for the next budget for any major announcements. However, ET Mutual Funds reached out to find out what mutual fund managers are expecting from the budget.Since it is a vote on account budget, it is unlikely to contain anything that impacts the market directly. However, the market would be closely watching out for any statements to address the consumption slowdown. Any such announcements are likely to bring fresh retail inflow into equities.The vote on account should focus on growth and inclusion. Growth should be boosted through investments led by road, railway, water, renewable energy, digital education and healthcare. The same should be funded through asset monetization and divestment so that the path of fiscal prudence can be achieved. Steps should be taken to unlock savings invested in gold to provide internal resources for funding growth and reducing reliance on global capital.We expect the government to work towards its glide path of fiscal consolidation and accordingly, fiscal deficit to GDP for FY25 is likely to be in the band of 5.3%~5.5%. Spending on capex is likely to be the focus area for the Government like last year. The borrowing requirements will likely be met with flows from the J.P. Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index to start from June 24.The Union Budget of 2024-25 is targeting a fiscal deficit of 5.3% and capital expenditure outlay of Rs 12 lakh crores. Market expectation of the borrowing programme is similar to last year of Rs 15.50 lakh crores. This budget is expected to focus on investment and increasing the supply side of the economy. Given the initial forecast of normal monsoon, CPI inflation for next year should be below RBI projection of 4.5%. This should lead RBI changing its stance to ‘accommodating’ from ‘withdrawal’ of liquidity and rate cuts of at least 50 basis points. This should support GDP growth at the margin, as consumption growth has weakened due to higher inflation. Lower interest rates are expected to keep the bond market buoyant next year.As has been the custom, the government may not announce any major policy changes in the interim budget ahead of Union elections. So, the key focus area from the market’s perspective, would be the government’s fiscal deficit target and market borrowing numbers.Given the Indian economy is showing a steady growth trend, the government will likely continue with the fiscal consolidation plan to bring down the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP by FY 2025-26. Based on this glide path, for FY 2024-25, fiscal deficit target should be around 5.3% of GDP.Government’s borrowings from the bond market in FY25 might be lower than last year by around Rs 500-700 billion. We expect the gross market borrowing of around Rs 14.8 trillion and net market borrowing around 11.2 trillion in FY25.Lower market borrowing from the government coupled with rising demand from long term investors like PF, pension and insurance companies makes the demand supply balance favorable for government bonds. Demand for bonds will also be boosted by India’s inclusion in the global bond indices. We expect demand for bonds to outpace its supply in 2024. Thus, bond yields will likely go down and bond prices move higher. Since longer term bonds are more sensitive to yield changes, we expect long term bonds to perform better in 2024.”Fixed income Investors will largely look for:A fiscal deficit between 5.3-5.5% with a net market borrowing of Rs 11.5-11.8 lakh crore could be taken positively by the bond market.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/budget-2024-expectations-mutual-fund-managers-share-views/articleshow/107218139.cms

EdTech, also known as educational technology has its hopes pinned on the upcoming Union Budget 2024 (Interim). The Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Interim Budget 2024 on February 01, 2024.In India, the EdTech sector has experienced significant growth lately. This growth can be attributed to factors such as greater internet accessibility, a rising demand for high-quality education, and government efforts to encourage digital learning.: Improving digital infrastructure is a fundamental requirement for any EdTech project. It's vital to allocate more resources to enhance high-speed internet availability, especially in rural regions. This helps bridge the gap in digital access and ensures that everyone has fair and equal opportunities for quality education. The government is expected to announce sufficient funds for creating digital classrooms, supplying devices to both students and teachers and training educators on how to integrate technology into their teaching methods.: The National Education Policy (NEP 2020) highlights the importance of personalised learning and skill development. AI tools can customise learning paths, evaluate student advancement, and provide adaptable content. The budget can encourage research and development in AI-driven EdTech solutions that align with the objectives of NEP 2020.: Reducing GST rates on online educational materials and services can make them more budget-friendly for students and families. Offering tax benefits to EdTech startups and investors can draw increased investments and innovations to the industry. This may also promote the creation of educational content in various regional languages to cater to diverse populations.: Ensuring equal access to digital resources in both rural and urban areas is essential for creating an inclusive education system. The budget can allocate funds for initiatives like installing fiber optic cables, offering affordable internet plans for rural users, and creating community internet kiosks. Exploring partnerships with telecom companies through public-private collaborations can help accelerate the expansion of internet services in rural regions.: Offering financial aid for research fellowships, dedicated EdTech incubators, and collaborative research projects between universities and EdTech companies can support creativity and lay a solid groundwork for the future of education.Addressing these five points through careful budget planning and policy actions holds the promise of unlocking the potential of EdTech in India. This has the potential to enhance the quality and accessibility of education, empower teachers, and equip students with the skills needed for a successful future.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/union-budget-2024-5-expectations-of-the-edtech-sector-this-year/articleshow/107202305.cms

Focus on Skill Development and Practical Training

Investment in Technological Infrastructure

Addressing Shortage of Qualified Teachers

Enhancing Higher Education for Global Attractiveness

Holistic Education and Inclusivity

As the Union Budget 2024-2025 approaches, the expectation for positive changes in the education sector is high. Despite strides made with initiatives like the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, there remains much to be done to elevate the quality and accessibility of education in India. The growth and expansion of the education sector necessitate a comprehensive approach, integrating both innovative methods and proven practices tailored to individual student needs.This calls for a nuanced strategy that not only supports ongoing initiatives but also incorporates adaptable solutions to address the diverse challenges faced by students across the country.Support for NEP initiatives, such as the National Credit Framework (NCF) and the Central Universities (Amendment) Bill, is important for driving transformative changes. However, to completely meet the demands of a rapidly evolving global landscape, the budget needs to focus on skill development and practical training . The emphasis on up-skilling and producing job-ready graduates requires a strategic approach, resource allocation, particularly in areas like technology, healthcare, and engineering.Additionally, investing in technological infrastructure, including the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, is essential for fostering a skilled workforce ready to meet the challenges of the future. As we navigate the interim budget, addressing the shortage of qualified teachers and fostering collaborations between academia and industry through initiatives like the 'National Research Foundation' will be key to ensuring sustained progress in the education sector. The budget must also prioritize enhancing higher education's global attractiveness and promoting holistic education and inclusivity to create a well-rounded and competitive learning environment for all.Expectations include continued financial backing for transformative measures like the National Credit Framework (NCF) and the Central Universities (Amendment) Bill, in alignment with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.Given the emphasis on up-skilling and job-ready graduates, there is an anticipation for strategic resource allocation to support skill development initiatives, particularly in technology, healthcare, and engineering. Practical training opportunities are likely to be a priority.Recognizing the importance of technology in education, there is an expectation for investments in technological infrastructure, especially in the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), to ensure the development of a skilled workforce.Expectations include investments in teacher training programs and incentives to retain educators. The proposed 'National Research Foundation (NRF)' offers opportunities for industry-academia collaboration, and there may be expectations for budgetary support to incentivize such collaborations.To attract more foreign students, substantial investments in higher education are anticipated. The potential introduction of the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) and increased allocations to flagship initiatives like Samagra Shiksha, Eklavya Model Residential Schools, and the Skill India Programme are expected to be on the agenda.The strategic approach aims to address evolving education sector needs, emphasizing holistic education and inclusivity.

indiatimes.com,4 ways Budget 2024 can boost food and agriculture sector in India,"The Agri & allied sector Gross Value Added (GVA) is estimated to be about US$ 275 billion in FY23, contributing 15% to the nation's total GVA. The sector has shown a growth rate of about 4% CAGR during the 5-year period ending FY23.In FY24, the Government allocated about 1.9% of the total Union Budget to the Agriculture and Allied sector, and about 1.3% was designated to support small and marginal farmers through the PM KISAN Yojana. A significant portion, about 8.3%, was directed towards major subsidies, covering food, fertilizer, and petroleum subsidies.Within the Indian agribusiness sector, a substantial challenge revolves around the comparatively low productivity of farmers, particularly the prevalence of marginal and small-scale farmers with limited access to finance and technology. Over half of India's arable land relies on rainfall for irrigation, directly influencing farmers' productivity and incomes.The limited access to finance and technology leaves farmers without the necessary resources to bolster productivity or combat adverse weather conditions, pests, and diseases effectively.Complicating matters further, insufficient storage, improper handling, damage by insects/pests and transportation infrastructure, resulting in post-harvest losses. This challenge is exacerbated by a fragmented and intricate supply chain involving numerous intermediaries. This issue of food loss holds critical economic, and environmental implications, with India's food loss percentage hovering at about 4.5%, as reported by the Food and Agriculture Organisation.1: Enhancing India's Food Processing Sector for Sustainable GrowthWith the Indian food processing market projected to reach US$ 535 billion by 2025-26 at a CAGR of over 15%, expectations center on strengthening the food processing value chain. The government has taken initiatives to boost the sector under schemes, such as Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises Scheme (PMFME).Emphasis should now shift to promoting cluster development and micro-processing units, encouraging public-private collaborations, and enabling wider market access. Focus should be laid on encouraging FPOs in setting-up clusters and micro-processing units that will help farmers in deriving better price realization.2: Mitigating post-Harvest losses by Improving InfrastructureIndian Agri Value Chain faces substantial post-harvest losses, especially for perishable foods. Expectations revolve around enhancing storage and grading facilities, upgrading transportation networks, by leveraging existing schemes like Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) and Mission on Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH).Focus should be laid on establishment of multi-commodity cooling and grading centers, solar-powered micro-cooling units, and cooling units near airports and ports to reduce food losses. These interventions not only cut transportation costs but also empower farmers through better pricing realization and avoidance of distress selling.3: Paving the way for Agri-Tech adoptionThe agribusiness sector anticipates a surge in digital adoption as the Agri-tech market is expected to reach a valuation of US$ 13.5 billion by 2023. The government's initiatives, including the Digital Public Agriculture Infrastructure, Digital Agriculture Mission, and National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) Scheme, aim to foster farmer-centric solutions, promoting Agri-tech growth by supporting Agri-entrepreneurs.The government should aim to enhance the adoption of Agri-tech solutions such as AI-based precision agriculture, IoT-based real-time data collection systems, and drone-based agriculture to improve farmer yield and profitability.To maximise impact, the government should prioritize the reach of Agristack, that aims to provide comprehensive farmer information, including soil conditions, crop specifics, and land records across states thus, ensuring real-time access to crucial data on markets, schemes, logistics, and warehousing. Effective agristack, through state level data aggregation, can drive agricultural innovation and success.4: Boosting the Agricultural Exports:India's agricultural exports have grown at a CAGR of 6.6% from FY18 to FY23, reaching US$ 52.5 billion in FY23, highlights the need to focus on improving the export ecosystem.Focus should be laid on interventions like demand-driven production through regular market identification, strengthened post-harvest infrastructure with digitally enabled supply chains, adherence to global quality standards, and incentivising the promotion of agricultural exports.The envisioned initiatives hold the potential to empower farmers by minimising losses, enhancing income, and fostering technological advancements. Simultaneously, they aim to bolster the growth of agribusinesses by optimizing operations, increasing market access, and positioning domestic produce as a globally recognized brand. Embracing these expectations paints a future where Indian agriculture thrives through innovation, efficiency, and expanded horizons, benefitting both farmers and the entire agribusiness sector alike.The writer is Partner, Consumer Industry Leader, Consulting, Deloitte India.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/4-ways-budget-2024-can-boost-food-and-agriculture-sector-in-india/articleshow/107179958.cms

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the interim budget on February 1. As Budget 2024 approaches, India’s consumer electronics and durables (CED) industry is abuzz with anticipation and a touch of apprehension. The sector has witnessed promising growth in recent times, fuelled by rising disposable incomes, technological advancements, and government initiatives like 'Make in India.Here are some of the expectations from senior executives of consumer durables/electronics companies:""The previous year's budget had heightened industry expectations by reducing import duties on open-cell components, a key element in television manufacturing, by 2.5 per cent. While this move initially attracted major players with optimistic plans for domestic open-cell manufacturing, no substantial progress has materialized. Despite these developments, thefor open cells. Moreover, open-cell prices exhibit significant volatility, fluctuating between 10% and 800%. The supply chain for raw materials remains disrupted, leading to increased freight charges and capital investment. We anticipate that the government will take the necessary steps to streamline the supply chain.”In contrast to the smartphone industry, which benefits from various government support, PLI schemes, and manufacturing incentives, the television manufacturing sector, a substantial part of the economy, is yet to receive any advantages from PLI schemes or similar incentives, added Bajaj.The PLI schemes and various manufacturing incentives have already proven instrumental in supporting the consumer electronics industry, reflecting an impressive 53% YoY growth in the first half of calendar year 2023. To elevate the industry to international standards, additional support geared towards the export of 'Made in India' products is crucial. As we approach theUnion Budget 2024-'25, our hope is for a budget that consistently nurtures a robust environment for domestic manufacturing, fostering innovation and enhancing global competitiveness. The sustained backing of the 'Make in India' initiative remains integral to our growth trajectory.Critical to the success of the electronics manufacturing sector will be strategic investments in infrastructure and technology, said Rajpal, before adding “Tax advantages and streamlined legal processes are imperative for the manufacturing sector's vitality. A key focus area must be ensuring self-reliance in cutting-edge technologies to facilitate continuous local manufacturing. We eagerly anticipate the budget's unveiling, maintaining optimism that government policies will fortify the foundation for growth, innovation, and sustainable practices within the electronics manufacturing landscape.”""Union Budget 2024 is very crucial to maintain India's standing as the 3rd largest economy in the world.

(With inputs from ANI)

The education sector is looking forward to the upcoming Union Budget on February 01, 2024 (Interim), with expectations of some noteworthy announcements. These include advancements in digital infrastructure for education, possible reductions in GST for digital education, reforms in student loans, an emphasis on skill-centric education, and support for innovation in educational technology (EdTech).""As the country moves to restructure its education system, the reaffirmation of the teacher as a critical member in this journey gains greater emphasis.In this context, effective and ongoing professional development to upskill and equip teachers becomes vital. If education is to be transformative in nature, then teachers should be able to model the skills and competencies that we expect students to possess. Therefore, it becomes imperative for schools to develop a culture of learning to support teachers to improve their teaching practice; helping develop a culture of learning where at all levels people learn and develop their skills as a community,"" stated Nandini Ghatak, Principal of Modern High School International in Kolkata, as reported by ANI.Education specialists recommend implementing an intelligent financial model to enhance digital infrastructure for online learning, training teachers in digital tools, and improving internet access in rural areas, in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.""This requires budgetary allocation since this implies a major shift in the way schools across the country operate. Building teacher networks where exchange of knowledge and skills can be facilitated and devising clear pathways for teacher development and support will go a long way in building schools as learning organisations,"" added Ghatak.Supporting this viewpoint, Kim Menzes, Vice Chancellor of GD Goenka University, mentions that increased public funding will enable the integration of technology and ensure fair access to education for all.""The Indian Education sector stands at a critical juncture and allocation of resources is important to bridge the current gaps, improve accessibility, and elevate the quality of education, all of which are visionary targets set by the NEP 2020. There has been a persistent demand for enhanced public funding, revision of curricula to meet industry needs, and improvement of digital infrastructure to ensure equitable access to education. The higher education sector in India therefore expects significant financial measures from the Interim Budget 2024-25 that will enable academic growth and innovation. Specifically, the sector anticipates increased budgetary allocation for research and development, lower rates of interest for student loans, and less tax burden for universities,"" Kim Menzes told ANI.The education sector is gearing up for advancements in research and innovation within educational institutions, with the hope of supportive regulations and sufficient government funding.""In the education sector, the upcoming budget is likely to focus on strengthening and deepening the New Education Policy 2020 (NEP) initiatives. First focus will be Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) which is targeted to reach 50 percent by 2035. It is a big take and the budget is expected to allocate appropriate funds in the form of investment and capacity creation. Emphasis on vocational education is expected to be another focus as the NEP has kept a target of 50 percent of learners to have vocational exposure. The use of AI in education and further promotion of digital learning is expected to be the highlight of the upcoming budget. A well-designed teachers training module will be the need of the hour in this regard and we expect that the budget will take cognizance of this aspect,"" said Prabhat Pankaj, Director, Jaipuria Institute of Management to ANI.He further added, ""I am also expecting that the 'Study in India' program and raising the image of Indian Universities through international ranking of higher educational institutions must also draw the attention of the government in this budget. Private institutions are also looking up to a better and fair deal in terms of regulatory ease and government funding for research.""The education sector is looking forward to positive reforms aligned with the goals of the NEP 2020 in the Budget 2024.

indiatimes.com,Union Budget 2024: Will the government increase cybersecurity spending ?,"Cyber attacks report card for the year 2023

The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) allocated a sum of Rs 625 crore to improve the country's cybersecurity infrastructure in the Union Budget 2023. Out of the total, Rs 400 crore has been allocated to Cyber Security projects and Rs 225 crore to cybersecurity response team Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In). The announcement in the Union Budget 2023 is said to be the result of some of the cyber attacks that the country faced during the year 2022.One of the biggest was the attack faced by AIIMS hospital in Delhi in late November. Five of the servers at the institution are reported to have been attacked allegedly by Chinese hackers. AIIMS Delhi services were impacted for over 10 days.Analysts are wondering if the government will make a similar allocation this year as well. According to a report by Check Point Research, in 2023, in 2023, India was hit by 2,138 cyber attacks per week per organisation, which is a 15% increase on a year-over-year (YoY) basis. It added that last year was marked by a persistent escalation in cyber threats on a global level.According to the report, the cyber threat landscape saw an evolution, particularly in how ransomware threats were executed. It said that the year saw a notable shift in ransomware attacks as some attackers concentrated on data theft and purely extortion-based campaigns. ""This change in tactics is evident in two prominent attack campaigns – the MOVEit and GoAnywhere incidents. These attacks did not use traditional encryption-based ransomware; rather, they revolved around extortion, with attackers demanding payment in return for not publicly releasing the stolen data,"" the cyber security company noted.Sonit Jain CEO GajShield Infotech, said, ""The government is steadfast in its commitment to economic deregulation and the initiation of systemic reforms. Recognising the imperative role of Information Technology, it is dedicated to fostering inclusive growth across all sectors. As a technology-driven entity in the dynamic tapestry of India, we perceive innovation as the pulsating force behind progress. In the anticipation of the upcoming budget, we envisage a future where strategic investments in technology become the cornerstone of our nation's growth.""",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/union-budget-2024-will-the-government-increase-cybersecurity-spending-/articleshow/107173164.cms

(Kuldip Kumar and Tanu Gupta are Partners, Mainstay Tax Advisors)

Union Budget 2024 : In view of elections nearby, this year’s budget to be presented on February 1, 2024, will be an interim budget. Although generally no significant changes are announced in the interim budgets, budget events always create excitement as hopes build up to get some relief. In last year’s budget, the government restructured the slabs and the tax rates under the new tax regime (NTR) to incentivize tax payers to move towards a simplified tax regime by giving up certain exemptions and deductions.The slabs and rates remained unchanged under the old regime. Yet many taxpayers still chose the old regime, as giving up deductions like HRA, LTA, deductions for investments under Sections 80C/80D, etc. did not reduce their tax liability when compared with the one under NTR.The fact that the government also made the NTR the default regime last year means that at some point, in the near future, it is expected that there will only be one regime. But until that convergence happens, even those choosing the old regime have hopes from the budget. Here is the wish list, and some of them, if not now, do merit consideration later, when the newly elected government will present the full-year budget.Those continuing under the old regime are expecting the basic exemption limit to be brought to par with that under the new regime, i.e., Rs. 300,000. The surcharge of 37% should also be brought down to 25% as applicable under the NTR, as the maximum marginal rate under the old regime is high as compared to rates prevalent in developed countries.Currently, salaried taxpayers are allowed a standard deduction of Rs 50,000. It was re-introduced in 2018 and raised from Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 in 2019. It merits the revision considering the rise in the cost of living, and going forward, the same should be linked to automatic adjustments at year end with the cost inflation factor. Besides, there is no separate deduction available for expenses incurred by employees working from home. Several employers have permanently implemented the work-from-home model for the compulsory working of employees from home for at least a certain number of days in a week. This is another factor justifying the increase in the existing standard deduction limit.In the post-COVID-19 situation, there is a particular focus on the health and wellbeing of oneself and family members. The cost of medical treatment has gone up significantly and requires higher coverage for medical insurance. Therefore, the limit for deduction of medical insurance should be raised from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 50,000 and to Rs. 100,000 for senior citizens, including for expenses where they do not have the insurance. The risk of COVID-like diseases and their spreading tendency do require citizens to seek prompt medical attention, not only for their own safety but also that of others in society. Medical treatment being an important aspect of quality of life, the deduction under Section 80D of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) should be allowed under the new tax regime as well to keep taxpayers motivated to keep their arrangements in place in case of medical needs.Currently, the deduction for housing loan interest is available up to Rs. 200,000 under the old tax regime. The set-off loss under the head income from house property against other heads is restricted to Rs. 200,000. Considering the rise in interest rates and the cost of construction, the said limit may be raised to Rs. 300,000. Housing is an important requirement for every family in society. The government is also trying to provide housing for poor families. Therefore, the deduction of housing loan interest should be allowed under the new tax regime as well to keep tax payers incentivised to have their own home.A deduction of up to Rs. 150,000 is available in respect of interest payable on the purchase of an electric vehicle. However, there was a condition that the loan be sanctioned between April 1, 2019 and March 31, 2023. Considering India’s aspirations and commitment towards net zero emissions, the deduction under Section 80EEB be extended for interest on loans sanctioned after April 1, 2023, to encourage taxpayers to move on to electric vehicles. Further, to incentivize tax payers at large, deduction under 80EEB should also be available under the new tax regime.India has a large young population, and ensuring social security planning for the citizens of India is very important for a secured future and balance in society. The government introduced the new tax regime, and deductions under Section 80C and 80CCD (except for employer’s contribution) have been taken away for those opting the new tax regime. These should be reintroduced with respect to contributions made by the individuals for their own contribution for retirement planning to encourage taxpayers to save for their retirement.The existing method of taxing capital gains is quite complex. There are different tax rates and holding periods for different assets and for taxpayers with different residential statuses. Simplification in this regard will really ease tax payers, given that there is a sharp increase in people investing in the capital market.There are currently provisions in the tax laws where one ends up paying taxes on notional income. For example, if a taxpayer has more than two self-occupied house properties and those are vacant, tax is levied on a notional basis. This should be done away with.Currently, stock option income is taxed in two stages: first at the time of allotment of shares and then later at the time of sale of shares. Where an employee is allotted shares, tax is levied at applicable slab rates on the perk value calculated as a difference between the market value of shares at the time of allotment and the price paid by the employee. This creates a cash flow hardship as employees end up paying taxes without having realized any gains. When these shares are sold, employees pay capital gain tax on the appreciation in the value since the allotment of shares. In case there is a decline in the share price, employees suffer the loss of taxes paid earlier at the time of allotment, besides not making any gain from the shares. A stock option is one of the elements of compensation, not only to incentivize employees but also to remunerate them in a non-cash manner. In the case of startups, this is very relevant, as they have a scarcity of capital and need to hire and retain talent.Therefore, one point of taxation at the time of sale should be reintroduced, as it used to prevail several years ago.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-new-tax-regime-tax-slabs-hra-lta-standard-deduction-housing-benefits/articleshow/107141202.cms

Budget 2024 : The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has presented a set of comprehensive recommendations ahead of the Interim Union Budget for 2024-25, outlining a strategic roadmap to fortify India's economic foundation.The proposals span a spectrum of sectors, ranging from public investments to support for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), innovation, taxation, and the burgeoning start-up ecosystem.At the core of FICCI's recommendations is a fervent call to sustain and intensify the thrust on investments.Building on the encouraging data regarding capital formation and the increased investment-to-GDP ratio, FICCI emphasizes the need for continued public capital expenditure, particularly in physical, social, and digital infrastructure.The organization contends that India stands at a crucial juncture, and in light of global uncertainties, the government should persist with significant investments in the forthcoming budget.Furthermore, FICCI proposes the creation of an 'Indian Taxonomy' for green finance. The suggestion stems from the belief that a well-defined standardized taxonomy, comparable to global frameworks, is essential for evaluating exposure to sustainable versus non-sustainable activities.This approach, FICCI argues, would enhance transparency in the financial sector, compelling institutions to set sustainability targets aligned with national and global goals.In the wake of current global developments and the world exploring alternatives to China, FICCI recommends positioning India as the next global manufacturing hub.The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes have proven successful, and FICCI suggests extending the concessional tax regime for manufacturing operations for at least five years to provide stability and certainty for potential investors.This move is anticipated to attract large investments from global manufacturing companies, bolstering India's competitive edge.Recognizing innovation as a cornerstone for economic growth, FICCI underlines the importance of supporting research and development (R&D).The organization proposes refinements to the existing patent box regime, extending concessional tax rates, and introducing incentives for new R&D companies.These recommendations aim to encourage innovation and ensure that companies investing in R&D are adequately rewarded.Additionally, FICCI suggests extending the concessional tax rate of 15 per cent to new R&D companies setting up substantial facilities within the next five years, further promoting industrial growth.In a bid to support the backbone of India's economy, the MSME sector, FICCI presents a series of recommendations.Firstly, the organization proposes revising the qualifying criteria for mandatory registration on the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platform.By making registration mandatory for all companies with a turnover exceeding Rs 250 crore, FICCI aims to broaden the platform's reach, providing easier access to funds for MSMEs.Leveraging the Account Aggregator framework for MSME lending is another key recommendation. FICCI argues that expanding the scope to include joint and corporate accounts would significantly benefit the MSME segment.Moreover, the organization advocates for changing the NPA classification norms for MSMEs, extending the limit for classifying overdue payments from 90 to 180 days.This extension, FICCI contends, would prevent the diversion of working capital towards loan repayments, preserving the normal business operations of MSMEs.FICCI underscores the need to simplify compliance with respect to Tax Deducted at Source (TDS). The existing structure, with various provisions for different categories of payments, has led to categorization and interpretation disputes. To enhance the ease of doing business, FICCI recommends a roadmap for rationalizing the TDS rate structure, suggesting three categories and introducing a ""negative list"" of payments exempt from TDS.This streamlined approach aims to reduce compliance burdens on taxpayers and mitigate disputes.Drawing attention to the issue of double taxation in buy-back transactions conducted through the 'open market through stock exchange' method, FICCI proposes exempting Buyback Distribution Tax (BBT) for listed shares under this method.This move aims to prevent double taxation on the same transaction, aligning taxation with the unique nature of these buy-backs.FICCI envisions collaborative efforts between the banking industry and regulatory bodies to accelerate the creation of digital securities, particularly for physical collateral such as land and vehicles.By digitizing these assets, the verification and lien-marking processes would become more efficient, fostering credit growth. The Account Aggregator framework could also be leveraged to expedite the adoption of information collateral, further increasing credit penetration.Recognizing the pivotal role of start-ups in fostering innovation and economic growth, FICCI recommends treating listed and unlisted equities at par for computing long-term capital gains (LTCG).This parity would make start-up and unlisted equity investments more attractive for both domestic and international investors.Additionally, FICCI advocates for extending the benefit of tax deferral on Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) perquisites to all employees, irrespective of whether their companies qualify under section 80IAC.In a bid to enhance dispute resolution mechanisms, FICCI proposes the creation of an independent forum comprising retired judges, professionals, or experts.This forum would focus on disputes at the assessment or post-assessment levels. The recommendations outline a structured approach, including strict timelines, limited adjournments, and draft order reviews, to ensure a fair and expedited resolution.This initiative aims to instill confidence in taxpayers, encouraging settlements and reducing the burden of litigation.In conclusion, FICCI's budget recommendations are comprehensive, addressing diverse facets of India's economic landscape.The proposals align with the current global economic scenario and strive to fortify India's position as a key player in the international arena.As the country awaits the unveiling of the Interim Union Budget, FICCI's recommendations reflect a forward-looking vision for economic resilience, innovation, and sustained growth.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-ficci-advocates-measures-in-comprehensive-budget-recommendations-for-2024-25/articleshow/107144328.cms

indiatimes.com,Interim Budget: Expectations soar as agriculture and healthcare industry weigh in on union budget 2024-25,"

As the Union Budget 2024-25 approaches against the backdrop of looming general elections, industry leaders express their expectations and insights on key sectors like agriculture and healthcare, anticipating a budget that strikes a balance between fiscal responsibility and populist measures.Vasu Naren, Chairman and Managing Director, Sona Machinery Ltd., emphasized the significance of the proposed record-high goal for agriculture credit amounting to Rs 20 lakh crore.According to Naren, this ambitious target aligns with the vision of empowering Indian farmers to enhance productivity through the adoption of smart machines and advanced agricultural techniques.Naren said, ""The emphasis on achieving a record-high goal for agriculture credit of Rs 20 lakh crore is noteworthy, as it is expected to enable Indian farmers to enhance their output through the adoption of smart machines and advanced agricultural techniques"".The emphasis on agriculture credit could trigger increased demand for cutting-edge farm machinery and crop management solutions. This demand is particularly crucial as it aligns intending to meet the rising global demand for Indian grains.The allocation of Rs 2 trillion to the agriculture ministry in the upcoming budget is expected to support government initiatives focused on farmers' income and crop insurance.However, Naren stressed the need for additional measures such as providing incentives and loans for acquiring agricultural machinery. He emphasized that this approach aligns with the broader vision of fostering a technologically advanced agricultural sector in India.Naren said, ""Reducing duties on raw materials for agricultural machinery is essential to ensure the affordability of such equipment. The objective is to make agricultural machinery easily accessible nationwide and promote the export of Indian agricultural machinery globally. While the Union Budget prioritizes supporting farmers' growth, it is imperative to ensure that essential support is extended to domestic agricultural machinery production companies for the accelerated advancement of the agriculture sector in the country.""Lowering duties on raw materials for agricultural machinery is also crucial to ensure the affordability and accessibility of such equipment.This aims to promote the export of Indian agricultural machinery globally while prioritizing the growth of the domestic agricultural machinery production sector.Aman Puri, Founder of Steadfast Nutrition, a sports nutrition and wellness brand in India, voiced concerns about India's healthcare sector Despite being a pharmaceutical hub and home to a significant share of the global disease burden, India allocates only 2.1 per cent of its GDP to healthcare, well below the world average of 6 per cent.Puri said, ""In recent times, we have witnessed the spread of new or less-discovered diseases, which have proved to be fatal and require investigation, research and so funds. Building of new infrastructure is also required to prevent air and water-borne diseases, necessitating the need for increased expenditure on healthcare in Budget 2024-25"".He added, ""Apart from this, India is heading towards being the global manufacturing leader in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical segment - these sectors require immense government support and subsidiaries -- especially to develop new industrial economic zones in Tier 2 and 3 cities with the help of government bodies"".""We must also strengthen the Ayush system, helping the traditional medicine school of thought to be introduced into the school curriculum to keep the coming generations aware of the traditional school of medicine, including ayurveda, unani, Tibetan form of medicine, and others"", said PuriPuri called for a substantial increase in healthcare allocations, suggesting a minimum of 5 per cent of the union budget be dedicated to healthcare.With the emergence of new or less-discovered diseases, he emphasized the need for funds for research, investigation, and infrastructure development to combat air and water-borne diseases effectively.Highlighting India's potential as a global manufacturing leader in pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, Puri urged the government to provide substantial support and subsidies.He specifically called for the development of new industrial economic zones in Tier 2 and 3 cities with government assistance.In addition, Puri emphasized the importance of strengthening the Ayush system, integrating traditional forms of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani, and Tibetan medicine into school curriculums. This, he believes, will contribute to keeping future generations aware of traditional schools of medicine, ensuring a holistic approach to healthcare.As the Union Budget 2024-25 approaches, the expectations and insights from industry leaders reflect a collective call for targeted allocations and policies that address the unique challenges and opportunities in the agriculture and healthcare sectors, contributing to the overall economic growth of the nation.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/interim-budget-expectations-soar-as-agriculture-and-healthcare-industry-weigh-in-on-union-budget-2024-25/articleshow/107135433.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Sitharaman may significantly enhance allocation for farm sector schemes,"

The government is likely to significantly enhance allocation for key farm sector schemes and push credit in the interim Budget to boost rural economy as growth in the agriculture sector is projected to decelerate to 1.8 per cent in 2023-24 from 4 per cent a year ago. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the interim Budget on February 1, which will be the last major economic document of the Narendra Modi-led government ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.In the 2019 interim Budget ahead of the 2019 general elections, the government announced PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi, under which up to Rs 6,000 financial assistance is provided to small farmers annually. In the election year, there are expectations that the quantum of assistance may increase in the upcoming Budget.Also, the government is likely to announce a substantial increase in the agricultural credit target to Rs 22-25 lakh crore for the next fiscal and ensure every eligible farmer has access to institutional credit. The government's agri-credit target is Rs 20 lakh crore for the ongoing fiscal.In the current fiscal, about 82 per cent of the agri-credit target of Rs 20 lakh crore has been achieved till December 2023.Director General of industry body CII Chandrajit Banerjee said agriculture and rural segments should be a key priority to drive inclusive growth in the interim Budget.""In agriculture, warehousing must be promoted to reduce wastage. Coverage of electronic Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (eNWRs) must be increased, and we have recommended allowing them to be used to access finance, trading, and settlement of trade,"" he said.The industry chamber also made a case for moving towards dispensing fertilizer subsidies directly as cash transfers to farmers.India needs budgetary support and stronger Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) to optimise operations and tap into emerging market opportunities, Gaurav Manchanda, Founder & Managing Director of The Organic World, said.""Higher farm insurance outlays, greater investment in rural employment schemes, better irrigation facilities, and improved rural infrastructure can make a huge difference,"" he said.In the Union Budget for 2023-24, Sitharaman allocated Rs 1.25 lakh crore to Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, including Agricultural Education and Research. The allocation was increased manifold from Rs 27,662.67 crore in 2013-14.In the upcoming interim Budget, M K Dhanuka, Managing Director of Dhanuka Agritech, expects that the government will continue the initiatives taken for the promotion of agriculture.""Specifically, we expect some increase in PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi and enhanced rural spending, potentially manifesting in larger allocations for established rural schemes. Improving rural infrastructure is likely to remain a prominent government priority,"" he said.In the last Budget, Rs 60,000 crore was earmarked for the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan). More than Rs 2.81 lakh crore has been released to more than 11 crore farmers as of November 30, 2023, through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) under the scheme.Ajai Rana, Chairman of Federation of Seed Industry of India (FSII) & CEO of Savannah Seeds, stressed the policy environment which attracts more foreign direct investment in the seed sector.""There is no denying that to improve productivity and farmers' income, we need more innovation. In this backdrop, a policy which encourages the protection of intellectual property and foreign investment would be helpful as this will encourage more players to invest in India benefiting our economy, farmers and overall productivity,"" Rana said.P C Musthafa, Global CEO of iD Fresh Food, said that the government should give priority to promoting food safety standards and substantial investments in technology.""As a proud 'Make in India' brand, our hope is for the budget to become a catalyst for innovation, streamlining regulatory processes, and fostering the growth of the food manufacturing sector,"" he said.CII has also suggested that the food and fertiliser subsidies, which constitute the bulk of the subsidies, should be rationalised by better targeting and efficient utilisation without impacting the deserving beneficiaries.Currently, the food subsidy programme is based on the data available from the 'Household Consumer Expenditure Survey 2011-12', the industry body said, adding that with economic growth and declining poverty, it is important to use more current data for better targeting.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/budget-2024-sitharaman-may-significantly-enhance-allocation-for-farm-sector-schemes/articleshow/107112026.cms

indiatimes.com,Union Budget 2024: Education Sector Anticipates Higher Budget Allocation and Emphasis on Digital Infrastructure,"NEW DELHI: With the Union Budget 2024 just around the corner, India Inc. is expecting significant announcements, including tax cuts, incentives and fiscal stimulus to drive the country's economic growth. The budget will be tabled by the Union Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, on February 01, 2024.In this regard, the education sector holds high hopes for a higher budget allocation and a significant push for digital infrastructure , pedagogy transformation, and teacher development .''As the country moves to restructure its education system, the reaffirmation of the teacher as a critical member in this journey gains greater emphasis. In this context, effective and ongoing professional development to upskill and equip teachers becomes vital. If education is to be transformative in nature, then teachers should be able to model the skills and competencies that we expect students to possess. Therefore, it becomes imperative for schools to develop a culture of learning to support teachers to improve their teaching practice; helping develop a culture of learning where at all levels people learn and develop their skills as a community,'' says Nandini Ghatak, Principal of Modern High School International in Kolkata.Education experts also opine that a strategic fiscal approach is the need of the hour to foster a conducive learning environment that aligns with the objectives of the NEP 2020 and Industry 4.0.''This requires budgetary allocation since this implies a major shift in the way schools across the country operate. Building teacher networks where exchange of knowledge and skills can be facilitated and devising clear pathways for teacher development and support will go a long way in building schools as learning organisations,'' adds Ghatak.Echoing her opinion, Kim Menzes, Vice Chancellor of GD Goenka University, states that enhanced public funding will pave the way for technology integration and equitable access to education.''The Indian Education sector stands at a critical juncture and allocation of resources is important to bridge the current gaps, improve accessibility, and elevate the quality of education, all of which are visionary targets set by the NEP 2020. There has been a persistent demand for enhanced public funding, revision of curricula to meet industry needs, and improvement of digital infrastructure to ensure equitable access to education. The higher education sector in India therefore expects significant financial measures from the Interim Budget 2024-25 that will enable academic growth and innovation. Specifically, the sector anticipates increased budgetary allocation for research and development, lower rates of interest for student loans, and less tax burden for universities,'' says Menzes.The sector is also zeroing in on advancing research and innovation within educational institutions and anticipates a supportive regulatory framework and adequate government funding to accomplish the same.''In the education sector, the upcoming budget is likely to focus on strengthening and deepening the New Education Policy 2020 (NEP) initiatives. First focus will be Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) which is targeted to reach 50 per cent by 2035. It is a big take and the budget is expected to allocate appropriate funds in the form of investment and capacity creation. Emphasis on vocational education is expected to be another focus as the NEP has kept a target of 50 per cent learners to have vocational exposure. The use of AI in education and further promotion of digital learning is expected to be the highlight of the upcoming budget. A well designed teachers training module will be the need of the hour in this regard and we expect that the budget will take cognizance of this aspect,'' says Prabhat Pankaj, Director, Jaipuria Institute of Management.''I am also expecting that the 'Study in India' program and raising the image of Indian Universities through international ranking of higher educational institutions must also draw attention of the government in this budget. Private institutions are also looking up to a better and fair deal in terms of regulatory ease and government funding for research,'' adds Pankaj.The Union Budget 2024 presents an opportunity for a significant shift in this narrative. It's time to envision hospitality education as a skill-based vocational course and a comprehensive, multidisciplinary educational stream critical to the nation's growth. The New Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes a more holistic, flexible, and multidisciplinary approach to education and offers the perfect framework for this integration.As India strides towards its goal of a USD 5000 per capita economy, the hospitality sector can be a driving force. To realize this potential, hospitality education must be recognized as a foundational pillar from the early stages of education. It requires a paradigm shift and regulatory oversight akin to professional degrees overseen by bodies like ICAI, BCI, Council of Architecture, and NMC Said Kunal Vasudeva, Co-Founder & Managing Director, Indian School of Hospitality.With all eyes on Budget 2024, the education sector remains optimistic about key reforms that align with the directives of the NEP 2020 and empower our students to navigate the intricacies of the changing business landscape.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/union-budget-2024-education-sector-anticipates-higher-budget-allocation-and-emphasis-on-digital-infrastructure/articleshow/107117695.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: Is Modi govt's pet scheme still strong enough to make India a manufacturing giant?,"A policy in the works



What the critics say of PLI scheme



How would a dedicated industrial policy be different from PLI?



The need of the hour?





The Narendra Modi government's flagship manufacturing scheme has received plenty of bouquets and brickbats from different corners of the world as India attempts to attract global bigwigs. But can India use the interim Budget and push a dedicated industrial policy to truly counter China as the global manufacturing hub?In the past three decades, India's successive central governments have made significant efforts to increase the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP from the present 17 per cent to 25 per cent. The government truly set the ball rolling for its manufacturing ambitions when COVID-19 struck and the production-linked incentives ( PLI ) scheme in 2020.In its present avatar, the PLI scheme provides 14 specific industries with a 3–5 per cent incentive to boost local production. And the ultimate goal of this policy is to decrease imports and augment exports. The proposed new industrial policy , which was expected to be released last year, has been at an inter-ministerial consultation stage. The main aim of this policy is to create a globally competitive business environment in the country to boost manufacturing and exports.If the policy sees the light of day, it would be the third industrial policy of India after 1956 and 1991, which was created amidst the balance of payments crisis.""Sustainability, R&D, MSME and ease of doing business for manufacturing are the thrust areas of the country's industrial vision. The draft is still under stakeholder consultation,"" an official told ET. The major industries covered by the various PLI schemes include textiles, white goods (AC and LED light components), electronics, pharma, and telecom, among others. The government had allocated Rs 1.97 lakh crore for the PLI initiatives in the Union Budget 2021–2022.A May 2023 research note created a furore when former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan questioned the effectiveness of the PLI scheme. Not one to hold back his words, Rajan described the scheme as ""a failure in the making.” Rajan, Rahul Chauhan, and Rohit Lamba, the authors of the note that was shared on social media, asserted that, despite the claims made, India has not truly developed into a global leader in the production of mobile devices.Rajan said that the government needed to look at data and undertake a detailed assessment of how many jobs had been created due to the PLI scheme, the cost to India per job, and why the PLI scheme did not appear to have worked so far before extending it to new sectors.""One of the key deficiencies of the PLI schemes for mobile is that the subsidy is paid only for finishing the phone in India, not on how much value is added by the manufacturing in India. India still imports much of what goes into the mobile phone,"" the note said.Meanwhile, the government stood by its stance with great vigour, and Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology, responded to Rajan, stating that his aim behind the criticism was to ""purely mislead readers, sensationalise the trade deficit, and put down the PLI scheme as a failure.”According to the Commerce and Industry Ministry, the production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for 14 sectors have drawn over Rs 95,000 crore in investment till September last year, and as many as 746 applications have been approved till November 2023 under these schemes.Moreover, incentives worth around Rs 2,900 crore have been disbursed in 2022-23, the ministry added. ""Further investments of Rs 6,766 crore are envisaged creating additional direct employment of about 48,000 persons,"" the ministry said, adding 13 foreign companies are investing Rs 2,090 crore under the scheme.According to data provided by Rajan, India exported none of the essential parts used in mobile manufacturing, such as semiconductors, PCBAs, screens, cameras, and batteries. He further pointed out that there was, in fact, an abrupt spike in imports following the enactment of import duties on mobile phones in April 2018.The current PLI scheme is primarily focused on industries that are capital- and skill-intensive, such as pharma, telecom, automobiles, and advanced battery cells, among others. This is where a well-conceived and focused industry policy could make a big difference by identifying specific areas where the country enjoys a cost advantage over China and other South Asian nations to offer the best combo of adequate labour, capital and skills.Meanwhile, an industrial policy could also pave the path for establishing a link between domestic suppliers and foreign firms, which would not only facilitate technological upgradation but also result in a boost in foreign direct investment (FDI).While it is heartening to know that the Indian economy has shown tremendous resilience amidst various global challenges and outpaces other major economies in terms of growth, the country's burgeoning population needs jobs as millions of young people are joining its workforce every year.Last year in October, India's overall unemployment rate climbed to 10.05 per cent, the highest in more than two years, according to Mumbai-based researcher Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. And this is where a robust industrial policy could come in handy, with a result-oriented focus on labour-intensive sectors such as garments, toys, leather, light engineering goods, and footwear, among others.According to HSBC, India, with a growth rate of 7.5 per cent, needs to create 70 million new jobs over the next 10 years to solve only two-thirds of its unemployment issue.An industrial policy would help in creating a conducive environment where the government could upgrade various sectors with a dynamic approach to leverage India's comparative advantage over peers, and that would create a cycle of profits and earnings and give the push to reinvestment by the same firms.Once domestic firms become competitive on a global scale, that would ultimately trickle into a surge in capital-intensive manufacturing.Reportedly, a proposal to extend the benefits of the PLI scheme to sectors like toys and leather is in advanced stages. But there could be a change this time, or one can simply hope that in Budget 2024, the government may extend the PLI scheme to more sectors with high employment potential to bolster its promises of providing jobs to millions.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-is-modi-govts-pet-pli-scheme-still-strong-to-make-india-manufacturing-giant/articleshow/107076845.cms
indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: A perspective on direct tax to ponder,"

Budget Expectations: This year is different for India, different in a good way. India is the fifth largest world economy today. It is also different, as this year, we will have two Budgets, one a more sober Vote on Account and the main Budget in July which promises to be a big bang one considering the reforms need to continue on the growth trajectory. So, whilst there has been the usual buzz and Budget wishlists floating around, the Finance Minister has made it quite clear that she’s going to play “spoilsport” and not join the party! So what will happen on 1February 2024? Well, our guess is not much, however, the government may use this opportunity to make some procedural amendments which are necessary to bring in clarity or give intermediate relief.What should find some mention in the Budget is in the financial services space is the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) which is emerging as a top destination for foreign investors. Whilst key policy announcements / tax sops may have to wait till the main budget, we may expect some interim measures to continue the momentum and pace of IFSC growth. Some of the IFSC related tax concessions are linked with the condition of commencement of IFSC operations on or before 31 March 2024 (e.g., tax concessions with respect to investment division of an offshore banking unit, tax concession with respect to royalty / interest income on aircraft / ship leasing, etc.). Considering that this deadline is fast approaching, in order to further promote financial growth in IFSC with a long-term objective, the government should extend this deadline to one or more financial year(s), so as to attract more foreign capital / players which are eagerly waiting to participate in IFSC growth story.Similarly, even for non-IFSC units, a concessional tax rate is provided for domestic manufacturing companies commencing manufacturing on or before 31 March 2024. Given the government’s intense and dedicated focus on the ‘Make in India’ policy, this sunset clause should be extended.In a bid to ensure a level playing field for income generated by specified funds / banking units under the Foreign Portfolio Investment (‘FPI’) route, the Government vide Finance Act, 2023, eliminated surcharge for non-corporate funds / entities. Also, the government eliminated health and education cess for specified funds set-up in both corporate as well as non-corporate form of presence. However, going by the literal interpretation of the provisions, surcharge for corporate entity structure is continued to be applied, which has created arbitrage in application of surcharge for corporatenon-corporate entities. Hence, in order to address this, it would be good if the government removes surcharge for FPI income even for corporate entities in IFSC.No Budget expectation is complete without what effects our individual bottom lines! Whilst, there is a lot of hope for sops pertaining to personal taxation considering that an overhaul of the tax rates under the new tax regime was already carried out in the Union Budget 2023, and considering the FM has already said she’s going to be a “spoilsport” not too much hope should be placed on any change in tax rates.Having said that, for salaried taxpayers, it has been almost 5 years since standard deduction was last revised in 2019. Keeping in mind the overall inflation situation, it would give some marginall relief if the standard deduction is enhanced to at least Rs 1 lakh. Also, in order to provide relief to middle income group the tax rebate under the old tax regime may be enhanced from Rs 12,500 to Rs 25,000 – bringing it at par to the new tax regime (although it would be applicable at the income limit of Rs 5,62,500 only as compared to Rs 7 lakhs under the new tax regime).On the corporate tax side, though the government may not be able to announce new reliefs it may make procedural changes/give clarifications on matters of immediate importance. One such amendment expected is on assessment timelines which has created a new hot pot of disputes. Recently, we have seen lots of assessments being quashed by the Courts due to certain interpretations of the timelines mentioned in the Act for completing assessments. Whilst these may be procedural issues, it goes to the heart of the matter as it impacts the assesse’s right to accept or object to the draft assessment orders.Typically, it was understood that the timeline to complete the assessment proceedings gets extended by ten months for cases referred to the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP). However, based on recent decisions of the Hon’ble Madras High Court and the Hon’ble Bombay High Court, it has been contended that no such additional time period is available to the tax officer and accordingly, any assessment orders passed during this extended time period will be considered as time-barred and bad in law.These decisions have a far-reaching and cascading impact on the ongoing tax litigation emanating from a DRP order. As stated by the Hon‟ble Madras High Court in case of ACIT v. Vijay Television (P.) Ltd [2018] 95 taxmann.com 101 (Madras)Therefore, apart from contesting the appeals on merits, the taxpayers have been challenging the very validity of the assessment orders and the Courts have been quashing assessments not adhering to the timelines. A lot of cases where the validity of the assessment has been challenged have been put on hold to await the judgment of The Hon’ble Supreme Court on this issue. Considering the stakes involved, it would not be surprising if some clarificatory amendments were proposed so as to clarify the intent of law. Any clarification, keeping the spirit of the judgements should be clarified in favour the taxpayers.Another procedural lapse being challenged by the tax payers is not quoting Document Identification Number (DIN) on orders. In 2019, the CBDT had mandated that any income-tax communication without the quoting of the Document Identification Number (DIN) will be considered as non-est. Taking cognizance of the same, recently, many High Courts across the country have held that such communication (including assessment orders) without DIN are invalid.This issue is also pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Whilst these may seem superficial issues, again it goes to the crux of respecting procedures and timelines and protecting the rights of both the taxman and assessee. Here again, whilst this may strictly not be a budgetary clarification it would be good if the intent of the CBDT Circular and the decisions of the Courts is upheld clarifying that such orders without DIN are non est.Therefore, given the limitations of the scope of this Budget, whilst no big bang reforms are expected, this Budget should be an interesting precursor to the full Budget in July. At the same time, the government is also conscious of its continuous efforts in providing necessary tax clarifications or amendments in the tax laws and policies, when needed. This proactive approach aims to sustain the economy's momentum and address potential tax uncertainties, to sustain investors’ confidence.The author is Deputy Head of Tax and Partner and Head, Financial Services, Tax, KPMG in India",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-will-sitharaman-play-spoilsport-when-direct-tax-matters-demand-attention/articleshow/107078358.cms

indiatimes.com,Budget 2024: MSME expects special package from Sitharaman on February 1,"

The MSME sector is urging Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to unveil a special package in the upcoming interim Budget 2023-24, with the aim of ensuring increased access to institutional credit at competitive rates This initiative is seen as crucial for empowering small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to play a more significant role in India's journey toward achieving a USD 5 trillion economy . Scheduled for presentation on February 1, this budget holds particular importance as it marks the government's final major economic document before the upcoming general elections.The MSME sector accounted for 29.15% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in the fiscal year 2021-22. Expectations include addressing the uneven power dynamic between banks and MSMEs, where the balance often favors lenders, according to the Federation of Indian Micro and Small & Medium Enterprises (FISME).""Lack of competition in the banking sector (75 per cent of banks being public sector) and weak regulatory institutions, which have not been very successful in ensuring customer centredness of banks, and near-defunct grievance redressal mechanism (Office of Banking Ombudsman) all coalesce into an unhappy experience for an ordinary MSME owner with the banks -- whether private or public,"" FISME Secretary General Anil Bhardwaj said.It is likely that Sitharaman may address some issues which are faced by this sector in the Budget announcement.In the fiscal year 2023-24, up to September 2023, the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises reported that the share of exports from products specified for MSMEs constituted 45.56% of the country's total exports, showing an increase from 43.59% in 2022-23.Deloitte, a consultancy firm, recommended promoting risk mitigation tools such as credit guarantees and insurance schemes to minimize capital flow risks for MSMEs, especially in sectors like automotive, electronics, industrial and electrical machinery, and chemicals. Highlighting that only 6% of MSMEs actively engage in e-commerce, Deloitte stressed the need for the government to reimagine and enhance the digital commerce ecosystem, addressing challenges for stakeholders to foster growth in this sector.Puneet Kaura, Chairman of CII Delhi State and MD & CEO of Samtel Avionics, emphasized that the MSME sector, vital for employment and manufacturing sector growth, faces a significant challenge in obtaining timely and cost-effective credit. Kaura told PTI this while highlighting the sector's role as a crucial contributor to employment and export promotion.""We want Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to come up with a special package for MSMEs in the Interim Budget, so that the small and medium units do not suffer for want of credit. ""This sector has the talent and risk-taking appetite and can play a big role in strengthening India's capabilities even in critical sectors such as semiconductors, space technology, defence, and medical equipment,"" Kaura said.In the Union Budget 2023-24, Rs 22,137.95 crore was allocated for the MSME ministry, marking a 41.6% increase from the previous fiscal year. Anticipation exists for even higher allocations in the upcoming fiscal year.The MSME ministry oversees various schemes like MSME Champions Scheme, CGTMSE, PMEGP, MSE-CDP, and RAMP, all designed to foster the growth and development of the sector in the country. These initiatives aim to support MSMEs in diverse aspects, reflecting the government's commitment to strengthening the sector through targeted financial allocations.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/budget-2024-msme-expects-special-package-from-sitharaman-on-february-1/articleshow/106988823.cms

Fiscal deficit target

Subsidies

Market borrowings

Budget 2024 : As the Union Budget is expected to be interim in an election year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has indicated that there won't be any ""spectacular announcements"" on February 1. However, similar to the 2019 Interim Budget, this one may still have noteworthy, if not extraordinary, implications for investors.ET quoted Sonam Srivastava, smallcase Manager & Founder of Wright Research, saying that the upcoming Budget is important, with expectations running high.The focus is on potential tax relief measures for boosting consumption and investment, particularly for salaried individuals and MSMEs . There's also an expectation of increased funding for infrastructure projects to create jobs and spur economic growth. The Budget's outcomes may have a notable impact on market sentiment and shape the economic direction for the upcoming year, Sonam Srivastava said.As an interim budget, it is expected that the government will persist with manufacturing incentives , back infrastructure-related capital expenditure in the country, and outline a strategy for disinvestments.Until the budget, which will be a vote on account, sectors such as railways, defence, infrastructure, power, renewables, auto, manufacturing, real estate, etc., will remain the focal points of attention.Here are the key factors investors should pay attention to in Budget 2024:Despite challenges in lowering the income tax rate due to fiscal constraints, taxpayers anticipate populist measures such as raising the basic exemption and house rent allowance exemption in both the new and old tax regimes.Srikanth Subramanian, CEO of Kotak Cherry , suggested that adjustments could be made to the income tax structure to promote the new taxation regime, aiming to simplify the overall tax system.Over the last three years, the government has been increasing capital expenditure (capex) by more than 30% annually, setting the capex target at 3.3% of GDP, the highest in 18 years. Goldman Sachs predicts the government will meet the capex target in FY24 due to positive gross tax revenues. However, it anticipates a slowdown in capex growth to around 10% Year-over-Year in FY25, in line with the government's medium-term fiscal consolidation plan.Deutsche Bank anticipates that the on-budget capital expenditure for FY25 will be Rs 11 lakh crore, compared to Rs 10 lakh crore in FY24.ICRA predicts that the fiscal deficit target for FY2025 will likely be established at 5.3% of GDP. This falls between the anticipated figure of 6.0% for FY2024 and the medium-term target of below 4.5% by FY2026.According to ICRA's calculations, every 10 basis points (bps) increase in the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio would enable an extra capital expenditure (capex) of Rs 324 billion.Goldman Sachs expects that the government will achieve the fiscal deficit target for FY24, set at 5.9% of GDP.The government has expanded the free food program for 800 million beneficiaries for the next five years. This is expected to incur a cost of 0.7% of GDP in FY25. Goldman Sachs expects that the cooking gas subsidy will be less than 0.1% of GDP due to lower oil prices, and the fertiliser subsidy is expected to be slightly higher than the pre-pandemic average of 0.5% of GDP in FY25.Goldman analysts suggest that due to sufficient demand for government bonds from Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and domestic investors, along with expectations of rate cuts in FY25, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) might become a net seller of government bonds in the fiscal year 2025.Goldman Sachs also predicts that the total issuance for both the central and state governments in FY25 is expected to be approximately Rs 17 - 18 trillion. To cover the central government's fiscal deficit of nearly Rs 18 trillion in FY25, Goldman estimates a net borrowing of around Rs 12 trillion, after accounting for non-market financing from sources like small savings and state provident funds. Additionally, for state governments, they assume that 70% of the fiscal deficit in FY25 (equivalent to 2.5% of GDP) will be financed through market loans, resulting in state net borrowing of Rs 5.8 trillion in FY25.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-key-factors-investors-should-watch-out-for/articleshow/106951243.cms

As Interim Budget 2024 looms on the horizon, the Indian crypto industry is buzzing with expectations, eager to witness how the Central Government will shape the regulatory landscape for virtual digital assets (VDAs). A focal point for industry experts is the pressing need for changes in the classification and taxation of these assets.One prominent demand from experts is the abolition of the 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS), a measure currently in place. Analysts argue that this TDS rate hampers investor participation by causing capital losses with each trade, discouraging potential investors from entering the crypto market.Leading voices in the industry have articulated their hopes for Budget 2024:We hope that the finance ministry would reduce the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) rate from 1% to 0.01%. Additionally, the offsetting of losses against gains made should be allowed. The underlying objective is to ensure a level playing field in the cryptocurrency space, devoid of regulatory or tax arbitrage for any participant.In the midst of India's burgeoning VDA industry, the forthcoming Union Budget presents a pivotal opportunity to propel its growth. A strategic focus on significant measures, such as lowering the TDS rate from 1% to 0.01% and aligning the tax rate with the framework applicable to other assets by reducing it from 30%, would undoubtedly invigorate the sector.Additionally, contemplating the establishment of a robust self-regulatory body for crypto and blockchain sector participants could be a game-changer.The Indian government's proactive stance on fostering innovation and responsible growth in the crypto industry is evident in various measures. The crypto industry in India anticipates a more balanced and forward-looking taxation system. The current 1% TDS on transactions and lack of offset are the barriers. Given India's prominent role in the grassroots adoption of crypto, it becomes imperative for the government to address these concerns.As an FIU-registered platform compliant with India’s KYC and PMLA rules, CoinSwitch urges the Government of India to consider the following:i) Reducing the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on VDAs, from 1% to 0.01%ii) Allow offsetting and carrying forward losses from sale of VDAsiiI) and treating income from VDAs on par with other capital assetsConsidering the positive strides made in discussions at the G20 summit, we believe that it is crucial to establish a regulatory framework. These developments, especially in reducing TDS and Capital Gains Taxes, would encourage a more inclusive participation in the crypto market.Moreover, a supportive regulatory environment will stimulate innovation, empowering the industry to transform existing businesses through the integration of blockchain technology.Government should look at creating special economic zones for Web3 startups and offer tax holidays to startups during the initial years so that entrepreneurs can focus on innovation and product development without worrying about cash flows.We call for strategic investments in research and development (R&D) initiatives specifically focused on digital asset security and compliance. This commitment will empower Indian companies to contribute significantly to global solutions and maintain India's competitive edge in the digital asset space.In the upcoming budget, we urge the government to replace uncertainty with clarity, not with a heavy hand but with a guiding light. A well-defined legal framework can unlock trust and fuel growth. This framework should address taxation complexities, establishing clear guidelines for income and transactions, not as barriers but stepping stones. Exchange licensing protocols should not be shackles but a badge of honor, ensuring responsible participation.The web3 industry eagerly looks forward to the Union Budget in anticipation of providing a new opportunity to support a thriving and responsible Web3 ecosystem in India. Web3 and blockchain, going ahead can solve many of India’s challenges in sectors such as payments, education, healthcare etc.The industry would also like the ministry to consider rolling out specific domestic regulations for India for greater stability, and dedicate funds for indigenous blockchain projects, exemplifying real-world utility and innovation.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/what-indian-crypto-industry-is-hoping-for-from-budget-2024-heres-the-wishlist/articleshow/106917856.cms

The government is working on finalising a proposal to double the insurance cover under its flagship Ayushman Bharat health scheme to Rs 10 lakh to ensure that serious diseases like cancer and transplants that entail more expenditure are supported by it, official sources said on Wednesday. An announcement to this effect is likely to be made in the interim Union Budget on February 1, the sources told PTI.The Union health ministry is also planning to double the beneficiaries to 100 crore under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) to include Kisan Samman Nidhi recipients, construction workers, non-coal mine workers and ASHA workers in the next three years.""In order to ensure that serious illnesses requiring expenditure of more than Rs 5 lakh such as transplants and high-cost cancer treatments etc. are also covered under AB PMJAY, the ministry is working on finalising a proposal to increase the cover amount from Rs 5 lakh per family per year to Rs 10 lakh per family per year from 2023-24 onwards,"" the sources said.The increase in coverage to Rs 10 lakh per family per year and increase in beneficiary base to 100 crore individuals will involve an additional allocation of Rs 12,076 crore per annum, the sources stated.The scheme has successfully catered to 6.2 crore hospital admissions amounting to more than Rs 79,157 crore till now since its launch in 2018.Click here to checkout Budget 2024 Live Coverage If the beneficiary had availed the same treatment on his own outside the ambit of AB PM-JAY, the total cost of the treatment would have gone up nearly two times, the official said.The budget allocated for Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY for the financial year 2023-24 is Rs 7,200 crore, which is likely to more than double to around Rs 15,000 crore in the financial year 2025.The AB PMJAY crossed the milestone of generating 30 crore Ayushman cards on January 12.With 4.83 crore cards, Uttar Pradesh tops the list of states having the maximum Ayushman cards.

Why Section 80C limit should be hiked

Will Budget 2024 hike Section 80C limit?

Section 80C FAQs answered:

What is covered under Section 80C?

How to calculate 80 C deduction?

Is PF included in 80C?

Interim Budget 2024 : The Union Budget 2024 to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should look to provide relief to taxpayers, say experts. One common ask every year is that the limit for deductions under Section 80C should be hiked from Rs 1.5 lakh. This limit was last revised in the 2014-2015 Budget from Rs 1 lakh.Section 80C is a popular one under the Income Tax Act, commonly used by salaried income taxpayers to claim tax deductions for investments and expenses.Some of the common investments that can be claimed as deductions under Section 80C are:Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India points out that the limit of Rs 1,50,000 for deductions under Section 80C has remained the same for the last nine years (it was last revised in tax year 2014-15).“Considering the inflation over the years and the fact that most of this limit is utilised by contribution to provident fund and principal repayment of housing loan, this limit should be hiked to at least Rs 250,000,” Surabhi tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner at Vialto Partners too says that with multiple options available for deduction under Section 80C, the present capping may get exhausted amongst the most common of them like employee’s PF contribution, LIC premium, PPF deposit etc. According to Chander Talreja, the government may consider increasing the said limit by another Rs 50,000/-. “Few options which may merit addition to the current list options of expenses are fee paid for upscaling certification courses, executive programmes, AI technology curriculums etc,” he tells TOI.Parizad Sirwalla, National Leader, Global Mobility Services – Tax, KPMG in India advocates for independent limits for critical investments and expenses. Investments/ expenses eligible for total deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C is a bundled basket, Parizad points out.“Hence, there has historically been an expectation to carve out certain critical investments / expenses out of Section 80C and provide a separate limit for the same rather than add more options in the basket,” she tells TOI. “Repayment of housing loan deduction is one such where a separate carve out can be considered and a separate deduction may be evaluated to the tune of approx. Rs 1 lakhs,” she elaborates, adding that from an overall deduction quantum perspective, every year the wish list is for the limit to be doubled to Rs 3 lakh.Experts are of the view that the Interim Budget is unlikely to tinker much on the income tax front, and hence any change in Section 80C limit is not expected on February 1, 2024.Parizad Sirwalla tells TOI, “This being an interim budget/ vote-on-account it is prudent not to expect major changes to the individual tax regime.”Chander Talreja is of the view that given the government’s focus is to encourage new personal tax regime (as per the trend in the last few budgets) it would be a bit challenging to hike the 80C limit, as presently, the said deduction is not allowed in New Personal Tax Regime.Some of the most common investments and expenses that are covered under Section 80C include; Life insurance premium paid, deposit in provident fund/superannuation fund, investment in fixed deposits/bonds, investment in NSC, tuition fee of two children, repayment of housing loan (principal amount), investment in mutual fund, /UTI eligible for Section 80C etc.You just need to add up your investments and expenditures that are eligible for deduction under Section 80C. If the total adds up to less than Rs 1.5 lakh then the entire amount is available as deduction for the financial year for income tax filing purposes. In case the amount exceeds Rs 1.5 lakh, then the remaining total above Rs 1.5 lakh is taxable.Yes, provident fund contribution made in a financial year is eligible for deduction under Section 80C up to a maximum limit of Rs 1.5 lakh.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-section-80c-limit-hike-ppf-provident-fund-expectations/articleshow/106895931.cms

Keeping in view the forthcoming general elections during April-May 2024, the government is expected to place an Interim Budget (IB) for 2024-25 on February 1, 2024, leaving the prerogative to place a full Union Budget after the newly elected government takes over. The Election Commission (EC) of India’s code of conduct does not allow the IB to include any major schemes in IB as it could influence the voters. The ruling government is also not allowed to present the ‘Economic Survey’ with the IB. It is intended to seek permission from Parliament to meet government expenditure for 4 – months of the fiscal – FY25. It may contain urgent measures which cannot wait until the new government assumes office. It will be interesting to capture some of the challenges and opportunities to shape up the IB.

Given the immediate challenges to spruce private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) which had slowed down, some measures may follow. PFCE is projected at 4.4% in FY24, less than the 7.5 percent recorded in FY23. The government final consumption expenditures (GFCE) growth was seen at 4.1 percent, sharply higher than the 0.1% recorded in the previous year.

The power to sharpen IB numbers could also come with a surge in monthly GST collections averaging to reach Rs. 1.6 lakh crore or even more in FY24, compared to Rs. 1.4 lakh crore seen in FY23. Similarly, the statement from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) indicates that direct tax collection, net of refunds, stands at Rs.14.70 lakh crore, which is 19.4 percent higher than the net collections for the corresponding period of last year. This collection is 80.6 percent of the total Budget Estimates of direct taxes for FY24. These data points indicate an overall resilience of the economy and depth of business happening.

Against the given backdrop, reviving sagging consumption demand, boosting government expenditure, and pushing forward private investments could be some of the priorities to sustain and work towards accelerating the pace of GDP growth in the coming times. The government may work out some methods to put more cash in the hands of people to step up demand for consumption while following the code of conduct set by EC.

Buoyant Economy:

Given the buoyant macroeconomic setting, according to the National Statistical Office (NSO), the GDP may expand higher than the expected rate of 7.3 percent in real terms in FY24 compared with 7.2 percent in FY23. At the same time, it estimated nominal GDP working out to 10 to 10.5 percent. According to experts, a nominal GDP of 10.5 percent is not ambitious for FY25 as wholesale price-index (WPI) based inflation has turned positive and 10.5 percent has been the growth trend in the recent past. The NSO data is based upon the computation of the GDP of the first half (H1) of the year and several high-frequency indicators for the October/November period. The GDP growth during FY24 is expected to breach the RBI’s revised estimate of 7 percent. However, the World Bank in its recent dispensation maintained its GDP estimate for India at 6.3 percent for FY24, 6.4 percent for FY25, and 6.5 percent for FY26 while maintaining the tag of ‘fastest growing economy among the world’s largest economies’ The World Bank further asserted that the GDP at US $ 3.57 trillion in FY 24 is expected to reach US $ 3.9 trillion in FY25 as the consumption growth may stabilize at 4.7 percent in FY25, up from 4.5 percent in FY24. The CPI inflation too is oscillating within the glide path set under the flexible inflation targeting framework with December data at 5.7 percent edging towards the upper end of the target while RBI is aiming to keep CPI inflation at its midpoint of 4 percent.

Balancing act amid challenges:

Despite the enhanced expected income streams from GST and direct taxes, the IB has to not only stick to a fiscal deficit of 5.9 percent of GDP in FY24 but has to plan out its way forward for further fiscal consolidation. It is more important to keep the IMF observation that the government debt could overshoot 100 percent of GDP in the worst-case scenario by FY28 unless it could stick to fiscal consolidation. In response, the finance ministry reaffirmed that the government is “on track to achieve its stated fiscal consolidation target” of reducing fiscal deficit below 4.5% of GDP by FY26. Hence, paring the fiscal close to 5 percent of GDP in FY25 may be imminent to way to hit the fiscal consolidation target.

With COP 28 commitments, allocations may increase green hydrogen and triple global renewable energy by 2030. The beneficial tax rate of 15 percent for new beyond the current period of March 31, 2024, may get extended to push the Make in India campaign. Home loan interest deduction up to Rs. 2 lakhs could be made available under the new income tax regime. Limits of investment-linked deductions could see a spike. The maximum rate of surcharge of 25 percent applicable to individuals may be slashed.

To push infrastructure funding, the government could increase the limit of investment in NHAI bonds to claim exemption from capital gains tax from the current level of Rs. 50 lakhs to Rs. 1 crore. The basic exemption limit for income tax could be raised and the limit of rebate under 80 D for the health insurance premium limit may be raised to accommodate rising premium costs.

The higher allocations to MGNREGA to increase the payout to farmers cannot be ruled out to alleviate poverty. With the increase in the cost of FMCG by 8-10 percent due to higher input costs, its sales dipped due to a drop in buying capacity. The increase in the risk weights by RBI on consumer goods, personal loans, and loans to NBFCs and credit cards could also douse buying capacity as financial intermediaries slow down credit to these sectors. Ensuring continuing growth while truncating fiscal deficit and boosting consumption growth is a stressful challenge in articulating IB amid the limitations of the code of conduct of EC.

BUDGET FAQs





Despite the chill in winter, the Indian economy is warming up to booming economic activity all around. One could hardly miss the crowded stations and airports, hotels going full, and streets bustling with people. Economic activity has been gaining momentum for over a few quarters, with questions on whether this year’s global economic headwinds are strong enough to impact the domestic buoyancy or whether they too will have bottomed out by the end of 2024. For the first time since Q4 FY 2017-18 , India's GDP has experienced consecutive year-over-year growth above 7.4%, excluding the post-COVID quarters. Leading high-frequency indicators also indicate the likelihood of sustained growth in the Oct-Dec quarter. Private investment has done the heavy lifting on the demand side while industry and services sectors have seen a strong rebound from their lows on the supply side. Corporate profits remain strong while business and consumer sentiments are improving.Consistent government efforts have been instrumental in guiding India through a series of crises. The last five years, marked by a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, the highest inflation in 40 years in the West (still ongoing), and two wars since early 2022, have been particularly challenging. Despite these uncertainties, India has steered ahead, tackling challenges with a series of reforms implemented over the past few years. Notably, these reforms have been a continuous process, not confined to annual budgets. They function like doses of vaccines, enhancing India's immunity to uncertainties. Whether through PSU bank mergers, corporate tax cuts, the national infrastructure policy, Production-linked incentives, the National logistics plan, digitisation initiatives, or the push towards renewables, these reforms were strategically announced to jumpstart the economy post-COVID while keeping long-term growth in mind.These reforms are now bearing fruits as one can see investments picking up. Consumer demand is yet to show up in GDP numbers, but demand for services and urban demand surely has seen its way up. In this fiscal year, the aim will be to accomplish three significant objectives through the Union Budget First objective would be to keep the fiscal deficit on target and continue with the momentum of spending on infrastructure and assets. There is excitement among global investors and manufacturers to invest in India and the objective will be to improve such capital flows to create new opportunities. Adhering to fiscal discipline will send a strong signal that the authorities are serious about keeping its house in order and give investors the confidence to invest in India.Click here to checkout Budget 2024 Live Coverage Secondly, the budget would mostly focus on navigating the global uncertainties. Not only does the global economy seem primed for a slower 2024, but the year is also perhaps the election year for the world as at least 64 countries—representing a combined population of about 49% of the people in the world—will head to the polls this year. With major nations such as the US, Germany, EU, and UK heading for polls this year, that is surely going to have an impact on global investment sentiments, policy changes, as well as capital flows across the borders.Finally, keeping inflation under control will be a key agenda in the Union Budget. Weak agricultural output is likely to have an impact on food inflation, which has been a constant challenge. India has managed to bring down inflation over the past few months, as supply chain disruption pressures have eased, and investment picked up. Core inflation has been on a downward trend. Ensuring that inflation from food is not translated into broad-based inflation is something that the focus will be on.(Dr. Rumki Majumdar is Economist, Deloitte India)1.

BUDGET FAQs



Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will announce measures in the Union Budget 2024 on February 1. With the health of public banks being relatively healthy, as pointed out by the Reserve Bank of India , executives and shareholders will keep a keen eye on the announcements for the banking sector.During the Budget 2023, for the second straight year, no allocation was made by FM Sitharaman for the recapitalisation of public sector banks, a signal from the policymakers that the health of these PSBs is in line with expectations.The FM recently was scheduled to meet the heads of PSBs to review the financial performance of lenders. The FM was to review various facets like financial inclusion, credit growth, asset quality, and business growth plan of banks for the next financial year, NPAs and the recovery status. PSU banks have earned a net profit of about Rs 68,500 crore during the first six months of FY24.Given that 2024 is an election year, the government will introduce a vote on account in February, with the complete budget slated for presentation post the General Elections.Click here to checkout Budget 2024 Live Coverage Banks have been raising funds from the market to augment their resources. The BJP-ruled government last gave capital support to banks in FY22 when it had earmarked Rs 20,000 crore for recapitalisation of PSBs through supplementary demands for grants.Between FY17 and FY21, the government infused around Rs 3.11 lakh crore to recapitalise banks, out of which Rs 34,997 crore were sourced through budgetary allocation and Rs 2,76,000 crore through issuance of recapitalisation bonds to these banks.In its reports released this week, the Reserve Bank of India has maintained that the country’s scheduled commercial banks are healthy and can withstand any macroeconomic shocks . The gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio continued to decline to a multi-year low of 3.2 per cent and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) ratio to 0.8 per cent in September 2023, the RBI said in its half-yearly Financial Stability Report (FSR).The report said the soundness and resilience of India's banking sector have been underpinned by ongoing improvement in asset quality, enhanced provisioning for bad loans, sustained capital adequacy and a rise in profitability.However, ratings agency ICRA said it remains cautious over “any material weakening in asset quality levels amid higher interest rates or an unanticipated impact from regulatory changes on banks, in addition to a slowing global growth, which can have a spillover effect on certain export-oriented sectors of the economy, and a tighter liquidity environment, which might exert higher-than-expected moderation in profitability margins.”As such, the government may keep an eye on measures required to offset external effects.In preparation for the Union Budget, the Finance Ministry instructed the heads of PSBs to assess all cases, particularly the top 20 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code cases, in the management of their non-performing assets.FM Sitharaman announced in her Budget 2021-22 speech the government's intention to establish a bad bank to address bad loans amounting to around Rs 2 lakh crore in the banking system. Additionally, the ministry conducted a review of the operations of the National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL) in another meeting. In 2021, the Cabinet approved a proposal to provide a government guarantee of Rs 30,600 crore for security receipts issued by NARCL.On the disinvestment front, the government's privatisation drive has seen diminished enthusiasm, as a cautious government, concerned about accusations of selling valuable assets, opts for the sale of minority stakes on stock exchanges instead of outright privatization.In the case of IDBI Bank , which garnered multiple Expressions of Interest (EoIs) in January 2023, the bidders are still awaiting security clearance from the government and 'fit & proper' approval from the RBI.Consequently, the privatization of all the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) in the list and IDBI Bank is likely to extend into the next financial year.1.

: India's finance ministry, led by Nirmala Sitharaman in the Narendra Modi government, has consistently emphasised fiscal prudence as a top priority. The goal is to bring down the fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent by FY26.Analysts expect Sitharaman to maintain the BJP government's emphasis on infrastructure spending on February 1 (Interim Budget 2024 ), aiming to reduce the fiscal deficit from the targeted 5.9 percent of GDP for the current financial year.According to ET, analysts suggest that the Modi government's optimistic outlook for re-election in April-May 2024 has enabled it to avoid populist measures. Instead, the government is concentrating on infrastructure projects such as roads and power plants.The government expects a 7.3 percent growth in the Indian economy for the current financial year, according to the recently released First Advance Estimates. Analysts note that achieving a growth rate exceeding 7 percent for the third consecutive year, especially in the current global environment, would likely contribute to Modi securing another mandate.In FY24, government spending is estimated to have increased by approximately 4 percent annually, contrasting with a minimal 0.1 percent rise in the previous fiscal year. Concurrently, private investment is projected to grow by 10.3 percent, slightly below the 11.4 percent increase observed in the previous year, as indicated by the data.Earlier this week, ETNow reported that the government might reduce the budget deficit target for FY25 to 5.2 percent of the GDP.The fiscal deficit is the difference between the government's expenditure and revenue, serving as a crucial indicator of a country's economic stability and health.Nevertheless, certain analysts have highlighted a concern regarding the heightened government expenditure on capital expenditure (capex), posing a risk to the nation's fiscal deficit and debt. This, in turn, is expected to keep interest rates high. Sitharaman allocated a record Rs 10 lakh crore for capital expenditure in the FY24 Budget.As of the end of November, the government's fiscal deficit reached Rs 9.06 lakh crore, equivalent to 50.7 percent of the full-year budget estimate. In the corresponding period of the previous year, the deficit was higher at 58.9 percent of the budget estimates for FY23. In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit amounted to Rs 9,06,584 crore for the April-October period of 2023-24.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/union-budget-2024-fiscal-deficit-target-will-fm-sitharaman-prioritise-fiscal-responsibility-once-again/articleshow/106667306.cms

GST compliance



BUDGET FAQs





Budget news: India's indirect tax landscape stands at a critical juncture, calling for sweeping policy changes that can propel economic growth and foster a more business-friendly environment. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been pivotal in India's tax reform journey, while ever-evolving, it requires further refinement and adaptation to address the evolving needs of businesses. One key area of concern is the complexity of the current GST structure, which often leads to confusion and compliance challenges for businesses.To begin with, a significant change that the industry is eagerly anticipating is the inclusion of petroleum products and real estate under the GST ambit. As of now, these sectors remain outside the purview of GST, leading to a fragmented tax system. Bringing them into the GST fold would not only simplify the tax structure but also promote transparency and reduce the cascading effect of taxes.The issue of tax rate rationalisation is yet another area that demands attention. While GST was envisioned as a single tax rate regime, the current structure comprises multiple tax slabs. Simplifying and rationalising these rates can reduce classification disputes, improve compliance, and enhance the ease of doing business. A comprehensive review of the existing rates, considering the revenue implications and industry feedback, is essential for creating a more harmonised tax structure. This move aligns with the government's vision of 'One Nation, One Tax,' providing a more cohesive and integrated tax framework.Another crucial aspect of GST that demands attention is the inverted duty structure. Certain sectors face a scenario where the input tax credit exceeds the output tax liability, resulting in accumulated credits and financial stress for businesses. Rectifying this anomaly by revising rates or providing alternative mechanisms for credit utilisation can enhance the efficiency of the GST system.Additionally, the implementation of an e-invoicing system has been a significant step towards digitisation and automation in the GST regime. Expanding the scope of e-invoicing to include all businesses may further streamline the tax administration process, reduce errors, and enhance data accuracy. It also aligns with the broader digital transformation agenda, promoting a technologically advanced tax ecosystem.Checkout LIVE BUDGET COVERAGE In the realm of GST compliance, the introduction of a simplified return filing system has been a positive development. However, there is room for further improvement. Businesses often grapple with the complexity of return filing, and a user-friendly, intuitive interface can go a long way in easing the compliance burden. Moreover, incorporating advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence in the GST network can help tax authorities identify potential tax evasion and streamline the audit process.The Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme has been a flagship initiative to boost manufacturing in India but aligning it with indirect tax policies is essential for its effectiveness. Integrating the PLI scheme with GST can help businesses seamlessly claim incentives and foster a conducive environment for manufacturing growth. Clarity on the tax treatment of incentives received under PLI would provide certainty to businesses and encourage investments in strategic sectors. Furthermore, extension of existing schemes as well as inclusion of new sectors would certainly help in promoting Government’s ‘make in India’ initiative.Foreign trade policy plays a pivotal role in India's economic landscape. Aligning indirect tax policies with the foreign trade policy can enhance export competitiveness and attract foreign investments. Simplifying export procedures, providing quicker GST refunds, and ensuring a hassle-free movement of goods across borders are essential elements to strengthen India's position in the global market.One of the key demands from the industry is the implementation of the 'faceless assessment' mechanism in indirect tax administration. This initiative, which has been successfully introduced in direct taxes, aims to reduce interface between taxpayers and tax authorities, minimising the scope for discretion and corruption. Extending this concept to indirect taxes can further enhance transparency, reduce compliance costs, and instill confidence in businesses.On the international front, aligning India's indirect tax laws with global standards is imperative. With the rise of digital transactions and e-commerce, revisiting the taxation of digital goods and services becomes essential. Adopting measures such as the Equalisation Levy on digital transactions is a step in the right direction, but a comprehensive and internationally aligned approach is necessary to address the complexities of the digital economy. Furthermore, the inclusion of environmental considerations in indirect tax policies can promote sustainable practices. Introducing green taxes or incentives for eco-friendly practices, benefits for sectors promoting same, can align with global efforts towards environmental conservation while encouraging businesses to adopt environmentally responsible practices.In conclusion, the indirect tax landscape in India may require a holistic tweaking to meet the evolving needs of businesses and promote economic growth. From further refining GST framework to aligning with the PLI scheme, foreign trade policy, and embracing digital transformation, the path ahead is multifaceted. A collaborative approach involving industry stakeholders, tax experts, and policymakers in crafting tax policy may not only fosters economic growth but also showcase the government’s intent at creating a fair, transparent structure.The time is ripe for India to embrace these policy changes and position itself as a dynamic and competitive player in the global economic arena.(Krishan Arora is Partner, Indirect Tax, Grant Thornton Bharat)Indirect tax is a tax imposed on the consumption of goods and services, not directly on an individual's income but added to the price of the goods or services purchased.The Goods and Services Tax is abbreviated as GST. In India, it is an indirect tax that has taken the place of numerous other indirect taxes, including services tax, VAT, and excise duty.FM Nirmala Sitharaman will announce the Union Budget on February 1, 2024",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/union-budget-2024-will-fm-sitharaman-address-the-complexities-in-indias-tax-system/articleshow/106656738.cms

What was the capex allocation in the Union Budget 2023?

Budget 2024: What are the various parts of a capex cycle?

When will the Budget be announced?

: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Interim Budget 2024 in the Parliament on February 1, 2024. The Narendra Modi-led NDA government pushed for a massive capex stimulus for the economy in the previous Budget.On February 1, 2023, during her speech, Sitharaman unveiled a substantial capital expenditure initiative, aiming to stimulate economic growth, with an allocation surpassing 3 percent of the nation's GDP.Approximately Rs 10 lakh crore was earmarked for capital expenditure, reaching a historic peak. Analysts described it as a package that would guarantee the continuity of India's cyclical recovery.The government is relying on the multiplier effect of this capex, with the Finance Ministry characterising the capex push as a crucial step in the pursuit of making India a $5 trillion economy.The substantial increase in the government's capital expenditure, rising from Rs 4.1 lakh crore in FY21 to the budgeted Rs 10 lakh crore in FY24 (BE), has not only fostered growth but has also triggered the influx of private sector investment, as per a ministry official quoted by ET.In the subsequent GDP growth readings, analysts identified the government's capital expenditure push as one of the primary catalysts for the country's economic growth.Data released by the Finance Ministry in December indicated that capital expenditure by CPSEs reached approximately 52 per cent of the Budget target, amounting to Rs 3.79 lakh crore in the first half of the current financial year. This surpasses the capital expenditure by CPSEs during the April-September period of the previous financial year.India's Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) to GDP ratio reached its highest point in FY20 and has since risen by 270 basis points. However, it still lags behind its previous peak, which occurred in 2010, by 500–600 basis points. According to a Jefferies research report cited by IANS, the expansion of all three components of the capex cycle—housing, corporate capex, and government capex—positions India to be less affected by a potential global slowdown.Capital expenditure (Capex) has surged by 11% to 9.5% year-on-year in the second quarter and first half of the financial year 2024. The expansion of India's growing investment cycle is apparent, indicating substantial potential for further growth. Capex, as a percentage of nominal GDP, is projected to reach nearly a decade-high at 30% in the fiscal year 2024, the report said.""We believe though, there is a long way to go in the capex cycle. From the capex cycle peak of GFCF being at 35 percent of GDP, the investment share in the economy declined to a low of 27 per cent in FY21,"" the report added.In the Union Budget for the fiscal year 2023, Finance Minister Sitharaman earmarked Rs 10 lakh crore for capital expenditure (capex).The Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is influenced by three primary contributors: households, government, and corporate.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to unveil the Interim Budget for the fiscal year 2024 on February 1, 2024.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-how-modi-governments-unprecedented-capex-push-in-last-years-budget-has-helped/articleshow/106633629.cms

The roiling of global financial markets has always led to worries on the currency front back home given the high current account deficit . This year though, any volatility resulting from global spillovers may not lead to runaway depreciation of the rupee as the narrowing deficit has made the local unit resilient, say economists.The rise in exports post-pandemic has given India's current account the necessary buffer, particularly since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, notes a report by Barclays Capital . Despite the steep surge in commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, vegetable oil, and fertilisers on which India is heavily import dependent, the current account deficit (CAD)was at a manageable 2% in FY23.""Reduced current account financing and improved capital flows have added to the economy's macro stability, a far cry from its categorisation as one of the 'Fragile Five' economies a decade ago,"" said Rahul Bajoria, head of EM Asia (ex-China) economics research at Barclays Investment Bank.India's external vulnerability remains low as import cover - measured as months of imports that forex reserves can fund - remains comfortable at around 11 months compared to seven months in 2012-13. Even foreign exchange reserves as a share of external debt at 99% is the highest over the last 10 years - excluding the pandemic year of 2020 - compared to 71% in 2012-23 before the taper tantrum that escalated in September 2013.The Reserve Bank of India is also equipped with over $600 billion of reserves to defend the rupee compared to $292 billion in 2012-13, adding to the market perception that the central bank is extra vigilant.""In our view, the RBI is keeping liquidity conditions tight to protect the economy and the currency from undue volatility given the financial risks brewing globally,"" wrote Neelkanth Mishra, chief economist at Axis Bank in his outlook for 2024.Axis Bank expects the CAD to remain at 1.0-1.5% of GDP in the next two years. ""The rupee's real effective exchange rate has been remarkably stable over the past five years as the RBI has dampened volatility. ... this year the rupee has been less volatile against the dollar than even against the yuan,"" Mishra wrote.Goldman Sachs is also forecasting a narrower CAD in 2023 and 2024 on the back of lower oil price forecasts from $86/barrel on average to $84/bbl in 2023 and from above $90/bbl (average) to $81/bbl in 2024, and services exports springing a surprise compared to earlier expectations.India Ratings expects CAD at 1.3% of GDP in FY24 from 2.0% in FY23. Flows in the capital account are estimated to improve to $73.8 billion in FY24 from $58.9 billion in FY23. This would lead to a net addition of $29.8 billion to the forex reserves in FY24. Ind-Ra expects this to help the rupee average to 83.05 a dollar in FY24.In a country as diverse as India, with its rich cultural, religious, and economic tapestry, it becomes crucial for the government to allocate resources wisely. This includes uplifting underprivileged sections of society, ensuring financial inclusion, reducing regional disparities, strengthening defense capabilities, providing quality education, and much more. Therefore, a well-planned budget is of utmost importance for any government to achieve economic stability and growth.The Union Budget is prepared by following a well-defined process that involves consultation, planning, and implementation.

This year, a 'concise' document on the state of India’s economy – and not a full-fledged economic survey – may be presented for 2024-25 ahead of the interim budget on February 1. What is the Economic Survey?

The Economic Survey encapsulates the annual economic development in the country and also points out the key challenges and their possible solutions. The survey is being prepared by the Chief Economic Adviser Dr V Anantha Nageswaran. What is 'Interim Budget'?

An interim budget is a provisional financial plan to manage expenditures for a brief duration, typically spanning a few months, until a new government assumes office. Given that the fiscal year concludes on March 31, and the transition to a new government usually occurs in late May or early June, the interim budget serves the purpose of addressing financial needs and revenues during this interim period. Subsequently, once the new government assumes office, a comprehensive budget for the remaining portion of the fiscal year is presented in July. When did the government commence its annual budget making exercise?

The Ministry of Finance commenced its annual budget-making exercise on September 4, 2023. What is fiscal deficit?

The difference between total revenue and total expenditure of a government in a financial year is termed a ""fiscal deficit."" It is an indication of the total shortfall in a government's earnings compared with its spending. In calculating the total revenue, borrowings are not included.



In the face of worldwide uncertainties, the imminent risk of economic downturns in the United States and Europe, and wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to unveil the interim budget of the Modi government on February 1, 2024, just before the Lok Sabha elections. The question arises: Can the Finance Minister strike a delicate balance between substantial initiatives and fiscal responsibility?Private sector capital expenditure needs to make a comeback for rebalancing the Indian economy towards investment and manufacturing - from a consumption driven one, according to V Anantha Nageswaran, India’s Chief Economic Advisor (CEA).Commenting on the fears regarding global uncertainty, Nageswaran said the situation is likely to remain the same. “Whether we like it or not, this is going to be a decade of uncertainty,” he said while adding, “The Indian corporate sector has to accept uncertainty for the rest of the decade and actually start to invest. Waiting for demand to arise before they start investing will be to delay the onset of such demand conditions happening.”But before the release of the Economic Survey, followed by the interim Budget, here are answers to some frequently asked questions:",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/budget-faqs/union-budget-2024-date-and-time-here-are-most-common-faqs-answers-to-budget-related-questions/articleshow/106021799.cms
indiatimes.com,Union Budget 2024: Key points and key facts that you should know in simple terms,"Until 1999, the Union Budget was presented at 5 pm on the last working day of February as per British era traditions. Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha in 1999 changed the Budget presentation to start at 11 am. Starting 2017, Arun Jaitley began presenting the Union Budget on February 1, departing from the colonial-era tradition of using the last working day.

Until 1955, the Union Budget was presented in English. However, the Congress-led government later decided to print the Budget papers in both Hindi and English. The Budget has since undergone many changes, with the 2021-22 edition making it paperless, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2019, Sitharaman became the second woman to have presented the budget after Indira Gandhi, who had presented the budget for the financial year 1970-71. That year, Sitharaman did away with the traditional budget briefcase and instead went for a traditional 'bahi-khata' with the National Emblem to carry the speech and other documents.

Till 2017, the Budget for the Railways and Union Budget were presented separately. After being presented separately for 92 years, the Railway budget was merged in the Union Budget in 2017 and presented together.

Till 1950, the budget was printed at Rashtrapati Bhavan till it got leaked and the venue of printing had to be shifted to a press at the Minto Road in New Delhi. In 1980, a government press was set up in the North Block - the seat of the finance ministry.



Ahead of the Narendra Modi led-government's Union Budget presentation after being elected for a record third term, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is aiming for fiscal consolidation, spurring growth and controlling inflation in what is going to be her seventh straight Budget announcement.India, now the fastest growing major economy, is aiming to become the third largest economy by 2030 and decisions from New Delhi will be crucial to fuel the chase.Before the country's date with the Union Budget in July, here're some Budget trivia:India's first Budget was announced in pre-independent India, on April 7, 1860, when Scottish economist and politician James Wilson - of the East India Company - presented it to the British Crown.Post Independence, India's first budget was presented on November 26, 1947 by then Finance Minister R K Shanmukham Chetty.Six-time presenter Sitharaman holds the record for delivering the longest speech when she spoke for two hours and 42 minutes while presenting the 2020-21 Union Budget on February 1, 2020. With two pages still remaining, she had to cut her speech short.The previous record-holder? Also Sitharaman. She broke her own record of July 2019 - her maiden Budget - when she had spoken for two hours and 17 minutes.Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may have been a man of few words, but during his stint as Finance Minister, he delivered the speech with the most words - 18,650 - in 1991.The Modi government's Finance Minister for their first term - Arun Jaitley - comes in at second, with a speech 18,604 words long. Jaitley spoke for an hour and 49 minutes.1977's Budget speech, delivered by then Finance Minister Hirubhai Mulljibhai Patel, measured in at just 800 words. Sitharaman's shortest Budet speech was during the interim Budget in February this year.Former Prime Minister Moraraji Desai holds the record of presenting the most number of Budgets of all time. He presented 10 budgets during his stint as Finance Minister during 1962-69, followed by P Chidambaram (nine), Pranab Mukherjee (eight). This will be Nirmala Sitharaman's seventh consecutive budget speech.At the bottom of that list is Congress' Manmohan Singh, with four, a number that Sitharaman overtook in February 2023 while presenting India's Budget for fiscal year 2024.The 1973-74 Budget presented by Yashwantrao B Chavan in the Indira Gandhi government was called the Black Budget as the fiscal deficit during that year was Rs 550 crore. It was a time when India was going through acute financial distress.The Union budget presented by VP Singh for the Congress government on February 28, 1986, was the first step towards dismantling licence raj in India. It was called the 'Carrot and Stick' budget as it offered both rewards and punishment. It introduced MODVAT (Modified Value Added Tax) credit for lowering the cascading effect of tax that consumers had to pay while also launching an intense drive against smugglers, black marketers, and tax evaders.Manmohan Singh's landmark 1991 budget under the PV Narasimha Rao government that ended licence raj and began the era of economic liberalisation, is known as 'Epochal Budget'. Presented at a time when India was on the brink of an economic collapse, it among other things slashed customs duty from 220 per cent to 150 per cent and took steps to promote exports.P Chidambaram in the 1997-98 budget used the Laffer Curve principle to lower tax rates to increase collections. He slashed maximum marginal income tax rate for individuals from 40 per cent to 30 per cent and that for domestic companies to 35 per cent besides unleashing a number of major tax reforms including a voluntary disclosure of income scheme to recover black money. Referred to as the 'Dream Budget', it also slashed customs duty to 40 per cent and simplified excise duty structure.Yashwant Sinha's Millennium Budget in 2000 laid the road map for the growth of India's Information Technology (IT) industry as it phased out incentives on software exporters and lowered customs duty on 21 items such as the computer and computer accessories.Yashwant Sinha's 2002-03 budget for the NDA government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee is popularly remembered as the Rollback Budget as several proposals in it were withdrawn or rolled back.Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2021 presented what she called was 'once-in-a-century budget' as it looked to revive Asia's third-largest economy via investing in infrastructure and healthcare while relying on an aggressive privatisation strategy and robust tax collections.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/budget-faqs/union-budget-2024-key-points-and-key-facts-that-you-should-know-in-simple-terms/articleshow/106021603.cms

Union Budget 2024: Personal Tax Expectations

Her recommendations on AIS are:

The information, collated based on PAN, is reported in AIS to provide a bird’s eye view of transactions under the PAN. However, the information captured is not inclusive of transactions that may be relevant and reported in the tax return. Amongst many transactions where the PAN is quoted, transactions such as Employer Provident Fund, Public Provident Fund, National Pension Scheme, life and health insurance policies, principal, and interest on loan repayment, could be additionally captured to widen the coverage of AIS. This would help in pre-filling the tax return with the data relating to applicable exemptions, deductions, the taxability of withdrawal proceeds, etc, she says.

At present, AIS provides information on the purchase and sale of securities in SFT portions of the AIS from NSDL/CSDL. While this information helps provide a bird’s eye view of the transactions made by the taxpayer in securities and mutual funds, it does not serve the purpose of capturing information and ease of data collection to prepare the tax return. Amongst other information provided in the AIS under this segment, mentioning the date and cost of acquisition, may be useful. This helps in accurate computation of capital gains, without the taxpayer having to go through records for this information.

Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the Union Budget 2024 in the Parliament on February 1, 2024.

Such a budget is presented to provide for government finances and smooth functioning of ministries till a new government is elected.According to Tapati Ghose, Partner, Deloitte India, Budget 2024 may focus on the new income tax regime. “This year, the government shall present the vote on account before the 2024 general elections. While it may not be the full budget, it is not expected to be a muted one,” she says in Deloitte’s Budget 2024 expectations report.If one observes the past pattern of the FM, the focus has been on making structural changes rather than providing tax breaks, Tapati notes. “Given this, one may expect to focus on the New Tax Regime, faster processing of tax refunds, robust tax collection machinery, and speedy disposal of appeals,” she says.Tapati also sees Union Budget 2024 as an opportunity to expand the information captured through Annual Information Statement (AIS). At present, AIS captures information relating to payments where tax is deducted/collected, bank interest, dividends, sale and purchase of capital assets, foreign remittance, refund from the income tax department, etc. This information helps prepare tax returns.",Center,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-focus-on-new-income-tax-regime-faster-processing-of-refunds-expected/articleshow/105961048.cms
indiatimes.com,"Who will present Budget 2024, and how is it prepared?","

The Union Budget is prepared by following a well-defined process that involves consultation, planning, and implementation. It takes months to execute these tasks, and the budget-making activity usually begins in August-September, which is six months prior to the date of its presentation.The ministry of finance prepares the budget in consultation with Niti Aayog and other concerned ministries. After presentation, the budget needs to be passed by both houses of Parliament before the start of the financial year, that is, April 1. The budget is presented by the Finance Minister on February 1. Nirmala Sitharaman will present her fifth straight Union Budget for fiscal year 2023–24 (April 2023 to March 2024). Here's all you need to know about the budget making process:As a first step towards the budget-making process, the Finance Ministry issues a circular to all the ministries, states, Union territories, and autonomous bodies asking them to prepare estimates for the coming year. This circular consists of skeleton forms along with the requisite guidelines based on which ministries present their demands. Besides providing estimates, the ministries also lay out details on their revenues and expenditures in the past year.After the proposals are received by the revenue secretary, they are thoroughly reviewed by the top officials of the government. The Department of Expenditures and various ministries conduct extensive consultations to thoroughly examine all aspects of these proposals. Once the data is approved, it is sent to the finance ministry.The finance ministry analyses the data and compares the estimates of revenue and expenditure to find out the overall budget deficit. In the next step, the Centre consults the Chief Economic Advisor and determines the optimal level of borrowing required by the government to meet the deficit.After considering all recommendations, the finance minister takes a call on revenue allocations to various departments for their future expenditures. In the event of a disagreement over the allocation of funds, the finance ministry consults with the Union Cabinet or the Prime Minister before proceeding.After the allocation of funds, the finance minister holds pre-Budget meetings with various stakeholders to get a clearer idea of their proposals and demands. These stakeholders include state representatives, bankers, agriculturists, economists, and trade unions. This year, the week-long pre-budget consultation meetings for budget 2023–24 were held in virtual mode between November 21 and 28. According to the Ministry of Finance, more than 110 invitees representing seven stakeholder groups participated in the eight meetings scheduled during this period. The stakeholder groups included representatives and experts from agriculture and the agro-processing industry; industry, infrastructure, and climate change; the financial sector and capital markets; services and trade; the social sector; trade unions and labour organisations and economists.Following the conclusion of pre-Budget meetings, the finance minister makes the final decision on the demands of various stakeholders after extensive consultation with the Prime Minister.To mark the final stage of the Union Budget-making process, the government follows an annual tradition of hosting a halwa ceremony. The ceremony marks the beginning of the printing of Budget documents after 'halwa' is served to the entire staff in the finance ministry. Last year, sweets were provided to core staff due to ""lock-in"" at their workplace instead of Halwa ceremony because of the pandemic and health safety concerns. To maintain the secrecy of the Budget, there is a ""lock-in"" of the officials involved in making the Budget. Budget Press, situated inside North Block, houses all officials in the period leading up to the presentation of the Union Budget. These officers and staff only come out of the North Block after the Budget is presented by the Union Finance Minister.Finally, the Union Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister. Until 2016, it was presented on the last day of February. However, from 2017 the Budget has been presented on February 1 each year.The Union Budget 2021 was delivered in paperless form for the first time, as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman replaced the Swadeshi 'bahi khata' and switched to a tablet. The Finance Minister carried a tablet kept inside a red coloured cover with a golden coloured national emblem embossed on it.In 2019, Sitharaman ditched the long-standing tradition of carrying budget documents in a leather briefcase and went swadeshi with a 'bahi-khata'. She had said that the Modi government is not a ""suitcase-carrying government"", in an apparent jibe at the past dispensations.The general public and Members of Parliament (MPs) can easily access all Budget-related documents on ""Union Budget Mobile App"", which was launched by FM Nirmala Sitharaman on 23 January 2021.",Center,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/budget-faqs/who-will-present-budget-2023-and-how-is-it-prepared/articleshow/96614455.cms
