ndtv.com,"""No State Has Been Denied Anything"": Nirmala Sitharaman Defends Budget 2024","No state has been denied anything in the 2024 Union Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told NDTV Friday evening, responding to opposition criticism that her speech this week mentioned only two states - Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, both ruled by key BJP allies.

Ms Sitharaman, who presented a record-setting seventh consecutive budget on Tuesday, said the centre had been required by law to support Andhra Pradesh after its bifurcation in 2014.

""States are receiving allocations as they have in the past... no state has been denied anything. The Act (Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act) requires the centre to support (the state) in building its capital city and developing backward regions,"" she explained.

""Several steps have been taken in the last 10 years (and) many other steps, as per the Act, which had to be done have been done. Yes, we will support (the building of the new capital, Amaravati, and the Polavaram irrigation project) ... Polavaram should have been completed but there are some technical issues. The state government is seized of the matter,"" Ms Sitharaman told said.

The Congress-led INDIA bloc had criticised the Modi 3.0 government for failing to provide schemes or even mention states not ruled by the BJP or its allies. The chief ministers of three Congress-ruled states - Siddaramaiah (Karnataka), Revanth Reddy (Telangana), and Sukhvinder Sukhu (Himachal Pradesh) - said they would boycott a Niti Aayog meeting Saturday in protest.

The meeting is being chaired by Mr Modi.

Apart from the Congress, Tamil Nadu's ruling DMK, also an INDIA bloc member, said no provision has been made for infrastructure projects like the second phase of the Chennai Metro Rail and similar developments in Coimbatore.

On Wednesday Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin, also expected to boycott the meeting, offered a warning to Mr Modi. ""The election is over... now we have to think about the country. Budget 2024 will save your rule... but will not save the nation. Run the government objectively... otherwise you will be isolated,"" he said on X.

The Finance Minister hit back on Wednesday, telling the opposition no budget could name every state in the union and that not mentioning them did not mean no funds would be given.

Responding particularly to criticism by Congress boss Mallikarjun Kharge, she said, ""To the point he raised - that I have not named many states and spoke only about two. The Congress was in power for a long time. They presented many budgets and should know that in every budget, you don't get an opportunity to name every state of this country.""

Ms Sitharaman also said the budget reflected Prime Minister Narendra Modi's wish to keep things simple, so everyone, and not just subject experts, could understand India's finances.

""We present everything upfront. There is no fine print... we ensure that any changes made are communicated openly, based on feedback and transparent processes,"" she said.",Left,Center-Right,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/no-state-has-been-denied-anything-nirmala-sitharaman-defends-budget-2024-6194796

ndtv.com,Budget 2024: A Progressive Blueprint for Inclusive Growth And Development,"The first Union Budget of Modi 3.0, presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is a nuanced mix of policy consistency, fiscal prudence, and a refreshing and zealous job push. In the last few years, the budgets of the Modi government have followed a pattern: heavy capital expenditure and high welfare spending, while keeping growth targets robust and the fiscal deficit in check. The latest budget has retained all those elements while expanding into newer zones. The biggest beneficiary of this budget is the youth, with an unprecedented push to create skills and job opportunities.

Empowering Youth

Empowering the youth and fulfilling their dreams is at the heart of the Modi government. The Budget for Viksit Bharat continues the government's trend of placing the aspirations of the youth at the centre of policymaking. With the Prime Minister's package of five schemes and initiatives for employment and skilling with an outlay of Rs 2 lakh crore for our 4.1 crore youth, the budget demonstrates a clear commitment to building a future-ready workforce. The government's emphasis on education, employment, and skilling underscores a forward-looking approach that aligns with the goals of Viksit Bharat. By investing in the youth, the government is not only addressing immediate needs but also building the foundation for a prosperous and resilient future. This budget reflects a visionary roadmap that leverages the potential of the young population to drive national growth and development.

Economic Stability Amid Global Uncertainties

Despite global economic uncertainties, including elevated asset prices, political instability, and shipping disruptions, India's economic growth remains a beacon of stability. India's inflation remains low and stable, moving towards the 4% target, with core inflation (non-food, non-fuel) currently at 3.1%. Proactive government steps to ensure adequate market supplies of perishable goods have contributed significantly to this stability.

Inclusivity at the Heart of the Budget

The Modi government has placed a strong emphasis on inclusive growth, focusing on four major segments of society: 'Garib' (poor), 'Mahilayen' (women), 'Yuva' (youth), and 'Annadata' (farmers). Administrative actions for the approval and implementation of various schemes announced in the interim budget are well underway, with necessary allocations made to ensure their success.

Transforming Agriculture and Rural Development

Agriculture and rural development are pivotal areas in this budget. An allocation of ₹1.52 lakh crore has been made for agriculture and related sectors. Agricultural production and productivity are prioritised, with 109 varieties of 32 high-yielding and climate-resilient crops set for release. Agricultural research will be comprehensively reviewed to emphasise the development of climate-friendly crops. Mission-mode production, storage, and marketing of crops like pulses and oilseeds will be strengthened.

To increase productivity and reduce input costs, one million farmers will be linked to natural farming in the next two years. Natural farming will also positively impact the health of the earth, the health of the common people, and the climate. To ensure fair prices for farmers, MSP rates are being continuously increased, with at least 50% profit on the cost being added to MSP.

Empowering Women and Tribals

The budget sets a target to make 3 crore Lakhpati Didi, bringing revolutionary changes in the lives of women. An allocation of ₹2.66 lakh crore has been made for rural development, including rural infrastructure. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, 3 crore houses will be built, both in rural and urban areas.

For women and girls, ₹3 lakh crore has been allocated for various schemes. PM Janjati Unnat Gramme Abhiyan is a new scheme targeting tribal-majority areas and aspirational districts, aiming to benefit 5 crore tribal people in 63,000 villages. Steps will be taken for complete coverage of tribal families in aspirational districts and tribal-dominated villages to improve their socio-economic condition.

Fostering Small Businesses and Eastern Region Development

The government will step up the implementation of schemes supporting economic activities by craftsmen, artisans, self-help groups, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, women entrepreneurs, and street vendors, such as PM Vishwakarma, PM SVANidhi, National Livelihood Missions, and Stand-Up India. The Purvodaya plan will foster the all-round development of the eastern region, covering Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh, making the region an engine to attain Viksit Bharat.

Supporting MSMEs and Infrastructure Development

The budget gives special attention to MSMEs and manufacturing, particularly labour-intensive manufacturing. A self-financing guarantee fund will provide each applicant with a guarantee covering up to ₹100 crore. Significant investment in infrastructure has had a strong multiplier effect on the economy. The government will maintain strong fiscal support for infrastructure over the next five years, with ₹11,11,111 crore allocated for capital expenditure, which is 3.4% of our GDP.

Boosting Start-ups

To bolster the Indian start-up ecosystem and boost the entrepreneurial spirit, angel tax for all classes of investors has been abolished. Social security benefits have also been improved, with the deduction of expenditure by employers towards NPS proposed to be increased from 10% to 14% of the employee's salary.

Simplifying the New Tax Regime

The new tax regime has been simplified with significant changes that benefit both salaried employees and pensioners. The standard deduction for salaried employees has been increased from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000, offering greater relief and boosting disposable income. Additionally, the deduction on family pensions for pensioners has been increased from ₹15,000 to ₹25,000, providing more financial support for retirees. These measures ensure more money in the hands of the common people, making the tax system more equitable and supportive of all segments of society.

In all, the Modi government has presented a comprehensive, all-encompassing, and inclusive budget embodying social justice. This budget provides a roadmap for India in 2047, moving the Indian economy towards a golden future. In just 10 years since 2014, India has become the fifth-largest economy in the world and is on the path to becoming the third-largest.

The Union Budget 2024-25 underscores the Modi government's commitment to inclusive and sustainable growth. By balancing high capital expenditure with robust welfare spending, the government is paving the way for a resilient and thriving economy. The focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class, combined with initiatives for rural development and support for start-ups, positions India for continued economic growth and development. The government's vision for a Viksit Bharat (developed India) is clear, and this budget is a significant step towards realising that dream.

Vivek Joshi, Secretary of the Department of Financial Services, and Chief Economic Advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran have also reached the ministry ahead of FM Sitharaman.

Minister Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget 2024 in Parliament today, marking her seventh consecutive budget and eclipsing the late Moraji Desai's record of six consecutive budgets, which is likely to focus on changes in the income tax structure and improving the ease of doing business in India. Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2023-24 along with the statistical appendix on Monday.

Sitharaman will lay on the table a statement (in English and Hindi) of the estimated receipts and expenditures of the government for the year 2024-25 in the Rajya Sabha.

ndtv.com,Union Budget 2024: Angel Tax For All Classes Of Investors To Be Abolished,"Representational Image

In a bid to bolster the Indian startup ecosystem, the Centre today announced the abolishment of angel tax for all classes of investors.

Angel tax is levied on the capital raised via the issue of shares by unlisted companies from an Indian investor if the share price of issued shares is seen in excess of the fair market value of the company. The excess realization is considered as income and is taxed accordingly.

""To bolster the Indian startup ecosystem, boost the entrepreneurial spirit, and support innovation, I propose to abolish the so-called angel tax for all classes of investors,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her Union Budget 2024 speech.

She also announced various changes with respect to tax rates for e-commerce players and certain financial instruments in the context of long-term capital gains.

Long-term gains on financial and non-financial assets will attract a tax rate of 12.5 per cent, she said, while the TDS rate will be reduced to 0.1 per cent from 1 per cent for e-commerce operators.

New Tax Regime Slabs Changed

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also said the standard deduction in the new tax regime will be increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000.

ndtv.com,Union Budget 2024: What Is Gender Budgeting And How It Aims To Allocate Public Resources,"Gender budgeting aims to allocate resources in a way that promotes gender equality (Representational)

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 on Tuesday. The central government is expected to announce significant measures for the welfare and empowerment of women.

According to the Economic Survey 2023-2024, there has been a remarkable 218.8 per cent rise in the budget allocation for women's welfare from FY14 to FY25, reaching Rs 3.10 lakh crore. The Gender Budget Statement has risen by 38.7 per cent compared to FY24 BE, accounting for 6.5 per cent of the total Union Budget, the highest share since its introduction in FY06.

What is Gender Budgeting?

Gender budgeting is a strategy that includes gender considerations in the budgeting process. Its goal is to allocate public resources in a way that promotes gender equality and addresses the unique needs of different genders. It involves analysing and allocating budget resources in a way that addresses the specific needs and priorities of women and girls and promotes gender-sensitive policies and programs.

Emphasis on women-led development

The Economic Survey highlights the importance of women-led development, starting with the health and education of the girl child. Key indicators show progress in this area, with the national sex ratio at birth (SRB) improving from 918 to 930, and the maternal mortality rate decreasing from 130 to 97 per lakh live births.

Government initiatives

Mission Shakti is a women empowerment programme launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) for the period 2021-2025. It aims to strengthen interventions for women's welfare, safety, and empowerment, making women equal partners in nation-building.

Initiatives like Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram, and PM Matru Vandana Yojana have also contributed to significant improvements in the welfare and empowerment of women and girls. These programs have led to an increase in institutional deliveries, from 78.9 per cent to 88.6 per cent, and improved public health service utilisation and birth spacing.

The Mission Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 programmes focus on improving women's health beyond just calorie intake and improving overall health and immunity with proper micronutrients.

Education is a key to empowering women. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the Right to Education have made sure that boys and girls enroll in school equally. For the past five years, more women have been enrolled in higher education than men.

Women's participation in skill development has increased. Under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), it grew from 42.7 per cent in FY16 to 52.3 per cent in FY24. The Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme has 82 per cent female beneficiaries. Women's involvement in ITIs and NSTIs rose from 9.8 per cent in FY16 to 13.3 per cent in FY24, and in the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS), it went up from 7.7 per cent in FY17 to 20.8 per cent in FY24.

The Women in Science and Engineering-KIRAN (WISE KIRAN) program has supported nearly 1,962 women scientists from 2018 to 2023.",Left,,https://www.ndtv.com/business-news/what-is-gender-budgeting-indias-budget-boost-for-womens-empowerment-6166934

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK chief MK Stalin too has said that he would boycott the NITI Aayog meeting to be chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 27 as a mark of protest.

""The Union Budget presented today was extremely discriminatory and dangerous, which completely goes against the principles of federalism and fairness that the Union government must follow. In protest, INC CMs will be boycotting the NITI Aayog meeting scheduled for 27th July,"" Congress General Secretary (Organisation), KC Venugopal said in a post on X.

""This government's attitude is completely antithetical to Constitutional principles. We will not participate in an event that is solely designed to hide the true, discriminatory colours of this regime,"" he added.

Earlier in the day, Finance Minister Niramala Sitharaman announced a slew of measures during her 80-minute Budget speech, including a hike in standard deduction in the new tax regime from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000, revisions to tax slabs in the new regime, cut in Customs duty on gold and silver, three schemes under employment-linked incentives, and Rs 2 lakh crore for job creation, among others.

However, the Congress took a jibe at the Centre soon after the announcements, calling them nothing but a ""Sarkar Bachao"" Budget driven by the political compulsions for the survival of this ""lame duck"" government.

Taking to X, Mr Venugopal said, ""The Budget will do nothing to address inflation or solve the farmers' crisis. It has absolutely nothing for the middle classes. Much like the 10 (previous) Budgets, this Union Budget is also far removed from the concerns of the ordinary Indian.""

""While the government has belatedly recognised that job creation is the need of the hour, its so-called announcements are totally insincere and non-serious. They could not even properly copy from our Nyay Patra.""

According to Mr Venugopal, merely throwing large headline numbers while giving pittances in reality is nothing but a cruel joke on the future of India's youth.

""Every segment of the Indian society is going to be in an even worse situation after this Budget, and this government that is completely cut off from the pain of the people will simply be concerned about its survival,"" he said.

ndtv.com,Union Budget 2024: Experts Urge Centre To Remove 18% GST On Mental Health Services,"Lack of mental health professionals is crippling in India, an expert said.

The government must remove or limit the 18 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) on mental health services, and allocate resources strategically to help India become a mentally resilient society, experts said on the eve of the Union Budget presentation on Monday.

Mental health is a key area of concern that can have a significant impact on the productivity and economy of the country.

""Mental health issues are highly prevalent, yet are poorly managed and are affecting a significant number of our population. In the upcoming Budget, we urge the government to remove or reduce the 18 per cent GST on mental health services,"" Jyoti Kapoor, Founder & Director of Manasthali Wellness, told IANS.

According to experts, with declining mental health, there has been an increase in the need for health insurance policies that cover both physical and mental health.

Unfortunately, people are not reporting these conditions as the cost of the available medications and therapies often proves challenging.

Divya Mohindroo, counselling psychologist, highlighted the need for comprehensive policies to handle India's mental health crisis and the need to increase the workforce in the sector.

""Out of an estimated 150 million people needing mental health services, only fewer than 30 million seek help,"" Mohindroo told IANS.

""Lack of mental health professionals is crippling in India, with merely 0.3 psychiatrists, 0.07 psychologists, and 0.07 social workers available per 100,000 people,"" she added.

""There should be specific measures for mental health, and we are hopeful the Budget will prioritise this urgent issue. There is an immediate need to strengthen India's mental health workforce, with just one psychiatrist per two lakh people,"" Mohindroo said.

She also suggested ""scholarships to train professionals to help reduce this gap"".

The experts also suggested incorporating mental health services into healthcare insurance coverage.

""While government centres receive some relief, private practitioners are left burdened. Extending tax benefits to private practitioners is crucial, given the high operational costs for the average therapist. In addition to acknowledging the financial difficulties experienced by private practitioners, this change would help lower the cost and increase public accessibility to mental health care,"" Kapoor said.

""This will help our citizens access mental healthcare without burdening them financially,"" added Mohindroo.

Speaking to IANS, small traders from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi have shared their thoughts on the Union Budget.

Chandanlal, who runs a Banarasi saree business, said, ""We have a lot of expectations from the Modi government, including reduction of GST on Banarasi sarees. There is high demand for our art and tradition, but due to increasing GST, sales are decreasing. If the government provides some help to promote our business, Banarasi sarees can reach people at lower prices.""

Surya, who runs a guest house in Varanasi, told IANS, ""The government should put an end to the commission given to brokers who bring guests to hotels or guest houses. Also, the GST on stays is very high. Even if a guest stays for one day, he or she will have to pay 12 per cent GST. To promote tourism, the government should reduce GST.""

Another trader said, ""We hope the government will provide tax relief to small businesses. Also, the prices of goods used in restaurants, such as lentils and raw materials are increasing. The government should address this problem faced by the small traders like us.""

Another trader from Varanasi hopes that the government will present a Budget that provides relief to both traders and the common people. ""The government should ensure that people do not get disappointed with the Budget. Also, the government needs to reduce taxes.""

ndtv.com,Union Budget 2024: These Are The Likely Winners And Losers,"Union Budget: The government and regulators also want to rein derivatives trading

The government unveils its budget on July 23 in the first major policy announcement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third five-year term, which could usher in changes to economic priorities.

After a shock election result saw the BJP returned to power relying on allies, the government is expected to boost consumption by lowering personal taxes or increasing spending on consumer-focused areas.

While that could benefit consumer goods makers, real estate and housing finance firms as well as infrastructure and auto companies, some sectors could also stand to lose, said brokerages.

Here are some of their winners and losers.

RURAL-LINKED SECTORS

The government is expected to allocate more funds for rural schemes to stimulate consumption, aiding consumer goods makers like Hindustan Unilever and two-wheeler makers like TVS Motor and Hero MotoCorp, according to Citi.

A less than 5%-7% increase in tobacco taxes could be a positive for ITC, the country's largest cigarette maker, according to Jefferies.

REAL ESTATE

The government is likely to allocate more funds for affordable housing, benefitting developers such as Macrotech Developers and Sunteck Realty, Citi said.

Moreover, the introduction of an interest subsidy scheme for urban housing would boost financiers like Aavas Financiers and Home First Finance, said Jefferies.

AUTOMAKERS

The government doled out subsidies worth 115 billion rupees ($1.38 billion) over five years to drive the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and Macquarie expects the government to retain both the quantum and tenure in its latest scheme.

That could benefit Tata Motors, India's top e-car maker, as well as IPO-bound e-scooter maker Ola Electric and e-bus makers Olectra Greentech and JBM Auto.

Conversely, lesser-than-expected EV subsidies could benefit Maruti Suzuki, India's highest-selling car maker and one that has chosen to make hybrid cars over pure EVs.

MANUFACTURING

The push on production-linked incentive schemes, which incentivises local manufacturing and creates jobs, is expected to continue, according to HSBC.

That will help manufacturers of technology hardware, telecom equipment, electronics and medical devices among others, like Dixon Technologies, Ideaforge Technology, Biocon.

Capital goods companies like Larsen & Toubro and infrastructure firms could benefit from the likely rise in capital expenditure in the budget, according to Jefferies.

TRADING

Any change in capital gains tax -- either by raising the holding period or tax rate -- could be a dampener for equities, Morgan Stanley said, though it says such moves are unlikely.

But, if enacted, they would increase the tax burden on equity and mutual fund investors, eroding the tax advantage they enjoy over investors in other asset classes.

It could also lead to lower trading volumes, weighing on brokerages Motilal Oswal, ICICI Securities, Angel One, 5 Paisa among others.

The country's mutual fund association has petitioned that mutual fund units be exempted from long-term capital gains tax.

The government and regulators also want to rein derivatives trading -- which has largely powered the stock market's rally since the COVID-19 pandemic -- calling it risky and speculative.

Any move to do so, such as through higher taxes, will not only weigh on the market but also reduce trading volumes and in turn, affect brokerages and trading platforms, Jefferies said.",Left,,https://www.ndtv.com/business-news/union-budget-2024-to-be-presented-on-tuesday-likely-winners-and-losers-6140610

The Union Budget for 2024-2025 will be presented on July 23, 2024, at 11 am in the Parliament. This will be the first Budget by the BJP-led NDA government since it was re-elected last month. President Droupadi Murmu has officially approved the budget session to begin on July 22 and continue until August 12.

This year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will become the first finance minister in India's history to deliver seven consecutive budgets. She will surpass the record previously held by Morarji Desai, who presented six consecutive budgets between 1959 and 1963.

Who has presented the most number of budgets?

Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai holds the record for presenting the most budgets in the country's history. He has presented a total of 10 budgets so far, a feat yet to be surpassed. Desai presented his first budget in 1959 and continued consecutively for five years, with five full budgets and one interim budget presented between 1959 and 1963. After four years, he presented another interim budget in 1967, followed by three full budgets in 1967, 1968, and 1969, presenting a total of 10 budgets.

P Chidambaram, former Finance Minister of India, is in the second spot, having presented the budget on nine occasions. Mr Chidambaram first presented the Budget in 1997, during the United Front government led by Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda. He went on to present the Budget several times during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) governments, from 2004 to 2014, with the exception of a three-year period when he served as the Minister of Home Affairs.

Former President Pranab Mukherjee presented eight Budgets during his time as Finance Minister. This is the third-highest number of budget presentations in Indian history. Mukherjee first presented the Budget in 1982, and his last Budget presentation was in 2012.

ndtv.com,Budget 2024: Longest And Shortest Budget Speeches In India's History,"Nirmala Sitharaman will present this year's Budget on June 23 (Representational)

The Union Budget has a long history, with various Finance Ministers presenting it over the years. Morarji Desai, Hirubhai M Patel, Pranab Mukherjee, and Rajiv Gandhi were some of the ministers who presented the budget, delivering speeches talking about the country's economic vision and goals.

This year, all eyes are on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will present her seventh budget on July 23. She has been presenting the budget since 2019, with her speeches focusing on economic growth, financial discipline, and social welfare.

Longest Budget Speech Ever

Nirmala Sitharaman holds the record for the longest Budget speech in the country's history. In 2020, she delivered a marathon speech lasting two hours and forty-two minutes (from 11 am to 1:40 pm). She made major announcements such as a new income tax regime and LIC's IPO. However, she felt unwell and couldn't finish the speech. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla stepped in to read the remaining two pages on her behalf.

This broke the record she set the previous year when she spoke for two hours and seventeen minutes. However, in 2022, she opted for a shorter speech, clocking in at an hour and thirty minutes, her shortest Budget speech since becoming Finance Minister in the second term of the Modi government.

Shortest Budget Speech Ever

Former Finance Minister Hirubhai Mulljibhai Patel delivered the shortest Budget speech on record for the interim budget of 1977-78, containing only 800 words.

Former Prime Minister and Finance Minister Manmohan Singh delivered the longest budget speech in 1991, with a total of 18,650 words.

Earlier in February, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman delivered the 2024 interim budget in 57 minutes, which marked the BJP government's final budget before the Lok Sabha elections.",Left,,https://www.ndtv.com/business-news/budget-2024-longest-and-shortest-budget-speeches-in-indias-history-6089898#publisher=newsstand

ndtv.com,Union Budget 2024: Insurers Expect More Tax Benefits For Health Insurance,"The finance minister is likely to lay out the government's economic agenda in the budget.

More tax benefits for health insurance under the new tax regime, relaxation in payment norms for MSMEs and incentives for the agri-tech sector are among the stakeholders' expectations from the first budget of the Modi 3.0 government.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the full Budget for fiscal 2024-25 on July 23, which will be the first major policy document of the new government.

Anup Rau, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Future Generali India Insurance Company said the deduction limit on health insurance premiums under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act has remained unchanged for the past nine years even though there has been a significant rise in healthcare costs across the country.

""It would be best if the limit for medical insurance is linked to inflation and gets revised automatically every year or once in a couple of years. Also, the benefits need to be extended to the New Tax regime since increasing health insurance penetration is critical. So, we hope the upcoming Budget to announce some hike in the deduction limit on health insurance premiums,"" Rau said.

Tapan Singhel, MD & CEO of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said reforms like offering health insurance to employees at negotiated rates, reducing GST on health insurance premiums, and offering tax benefits like increased Section 80D exemption limits would make health insurance more affordable and accessible, especially for the 'missing middle' segment of our population.

""Additionally, for senior citizens, removing the limit on deductions for health insurance premiums would significantly ease their financial burden,"" Singhel said.

The finance minister is likely to lay out the government's economic agenda in the budget.

On expectations from Nirmala Sitharaman's budget, D S Negi, CEO of Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre (RGCIRC), said the focus on reforming cancer care in India is crucial and it is important to prioritise funding for advanced treatments like immunotherapy and personalised medicine, ensuring more patients can access these cutting-edge therapies.

""Extending Ayushman Bharat to those aged above 70 years will be highly beneficial for senior citizens. However, the current coverage limit of Rs 5 lakh may not be sufficient for critical illnesses such as cancer, where treatment costs can range from Rs 15-20 lakh.

""Therefore, it is essential to consider increasing the coverage limit for critical illnesses like cancer to ensure adequate financial support for cancer patients,"" Negi added.

The budget is likely to include steps to fast-rack reforms to make India a USD 5-trillion economy in the near future and turn the country into a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047.

Ahead of the budget, Chairman of the Medical Technology Association of India (MTaI) Pavan Choudary said that customs duties and taxes levied on medical devices in India are one of the highest in the world which directly impacts patient affordability.

""On the other hand, countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, Italy, and Norway impose no such duties. Australia and Japan levy only a minimal 0.5 per cent duty, while in the United States, it stands at 2 per cent, and in China at 3 per cent.

""This stark contrast creates risk for illegal imports of medical devices in India that are not backed by legal and service guarantees. Furthermore, such trade would undercut the Indian government's tariff revenue,"" he said.

Vivek Jalan, Partner at Tax Connect Advisory Services LLP, said as per recommendations of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Section 43B(h) in the Income Tax Act was introduced from AY 24-25. However, the alignment of the disallowance for payables under sections 43B(h) of the Act has been made with the MSME Act, which requires that payment has to be made to an SME within a maximum of 45 days.

""This is difficult in the present-day trade where a 60-90 days credit period is the norm.

""In this budget, it is expected that this provision will be relaxed/amended aligning the same with the CGST Act w.r.t. disallowance when payment to SMEs is not made within 180 days. Hence, in case a taxpayer does not pay an SME within 180 days, then the expense may be added back to his income,"" he said.

In anticipation of the budget, Saurabh Rai, CEO of Arahas, has expressed high expectations for substantial investments in sustainability and geospatial technology.

""We anticipate significant allocations towards renewable energy projects and incentives for companies embracing green technologies,"" he said.

Additionally, Rai said that boosting agri-tech innovations, providing tax incentives for tech companies and investing in human capital development is imperative for driving sustainable growth.

Sanjay Kumar, Founder and CEO of Geospatial World, said that to fully leverage the power of digital twin technology, it is crucial to allocate dedicated funds to it in the Union Budget.

""This allocation will facilitate the widespread adoption of digital twins, driving efficiency gains, cost savings, and improved decision-making in infrastructure projects. By investing in this technology, India can achieve significant long-term benefits, such as enhanced asset management, reduced downtime, and increased resilience to environmental challenges,"" Kumar said.

Ms Sitharaman was given charge of the finance portfolio in the second stint of the Modi government after the 2019 general elections, becoming the first full-time woman finance minister in independent India.

This budget is the first of the new BJP-led NDA government, which came to power for a third consecutive term, and will outline the financial plans and priorities for the fiscal year. The interim budget was presented on February 1.

How the Union Budget is prepared?

The Union Budget is prepared through an elaborate process involving various stakeholders and takes several months to complete.

The Finance Ministry issues circulars to all ministries, departments, states, Union Territories, and autonomous entities, requesting their budgetary proposals and estimates for the upcoming fiscal year.

The ministries submit their previous year's earnings and expenses, along with estimates for the next year. The finance ministry then reviews these proposals, holds discussions with ministries and departments, and allocates revenues to various divisions for their upcoming expenses.

If there are any disagreements on funding allocations, the finance ministry takes it up with the Union Cabinet or the Prime Minister. The Department of Economic Affairs and the Department of Revenue also conduct consultations with stakeholders like agriculturists, small business proprietors, and foreign institutional investors to understand their needs and concerns.

Before finalising the budget, officials hold meetings with the various stakeholders for feedback and suggestions. Top officials, the Finance Minister, and the PM then review and discuss these inputs before making final decisions.",Left,,https://www.ndtv.com/business-news/union-budget-2024-how-the-budget-is-prepared-6074092#publisher=newsstand
ndtv.com,Union Budget 2024: Significance Of The Halwa Ceremony Week,"The Halwa Ceremony marks the beginning of the Union Budget preparation.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget for 2024-25 on July 23. The Budget session will begin on July 22, a day earlier, and is scheduled to end on August 12. Preceding the event, the finance minister and other officials will host and attend the traditional ""Halwa Ceremony"".



What is the Halwa Ceremony?



The Halwa Ceremony marks the beginning of the Union Budget preparation. It is a customary event held about a week before the budget presentation at the Ministry of Finance's basement in North Block, New Delhi.



The ceremony involves the preparation and distribution of halwa, a traditional Indian sweet, to the officials and staff involved in the budget-making process. This symbolises the completion of the budget documents and the confidentiality that follows.



During the ceremony, a large batch of halwa is prepared in the Ministry of Finance kitchen.



The Finance Minister usually initiates the ceremony by stirring the halwa in a large kadhai (cauldron) and then serving it to the ministry staff.



Significance of the Halwa Ceremony



The process of preparing the Union Budget is highly confidential due to its significant impact on the economy, markets and the public. There are several restrictions in place to maintain the confidentiality of the budget preparation process.



The finance minister and high-ranking officials involved in the process are required to keep the details of the budget secret until it is officially presented. After the ceremony, officials who are directly involved in the budget preparation process are required to stay within the North Block premises and are cut off from any external communication to maintain the secrecy of the budget details until it is presented in the Parliament. They are also prohibited from using mobile phones. This is known as the ‘lock-in' period.



The budget is only printed after receiving approval from the Prime Minister. Various entities, including ministries, states, union territories, defence forces and other departments, are tasked with preparing estimates. The Intelligence Bureau chief conducts surprise visits to the printing press area in the basement of North Block to ensure the secrecy of the process.",Left,,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/significance-of-halwa-ceremony-week-before-budget-6066196#publisher=newsstand

Ms Sitharaman has been at the helm of the finance ministry since July 2019 and is the first full-time woman Finance Minister of the country. She has already presented five full Budgets and this will be her first Interim Budget.

After the presentation of the Interim Budget, she will surpass the records of her predecessors like Manmohan Singh, Arun Jaitley, P Chidambaram and Yashwant Sinha, all of whom presented five full Budgets in a row.

Morarji Desai, who went on to become Prime Minister, had presented five annual Budgets and one Interim Budget between 1959 and 1964. He also holds the rare achievement of presenting a total of 10 budgets, the highest by any Finance Minister of India.

After the 2019 general elections, Nirmala Sitharaman took charge of the finance portfolio, becoming the second woman to present the Budget after former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the financial year 1970-71.

This year, the government is going to present the Interim Budget as the Lok Sabha elections are going to be held in April-May. The Interim Budget will help manage the government's expenses for the transition period until the new government takes over. The full Budget for the financial year 2024-25 is expected to be presented by the new government that will come to power following the general elections in 2024.

ndtv.com,Budget 2024 FAQs: What You Need To Know,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the interim budget on February 1.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget in Parliament on February 1, 2024. Since this is an election year, it is going to be an interim budget - a temporary financial plan covering the government expenditures until a new government takes over. A full-fledged Budget will be presented after the formation of the new government following the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. A full-year Budget serves as a roadmap, directing the nation's economic course for a complete fiscal year, while the Interim Budget presents the financial details for the transitional period.

Here are some frequently asked questions about the Budget

When is the Union Budget being presented?

The Budget is presented on February 1 every year. The tradition was started by former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in 2017. Before that, the annual financial document was presented on the last day of February.

An interim budget is often associated with populist spending since it is presented in an election year. But a Reuters report said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to buck the trend and instead focus on infrastructure to keep the economy humming while narrowing the budget gap.



It quoted Samiran Chakraborty, an economist with Citigroup, as saying that the government will likely aim to strike a balance between pre-election political messaging, fiscal consolidation needs and continued focus on capex.

PM Modi is also in a strong position to extend his decade in power in upcoming elections, so there's less pressure to take populist steps, Bloomberg Economics' Abhishek Gupta said in a report. The fiscal plan is expected to signal policy continuity, he said.

Where can I get information about the Budget?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present Union Budget 2024 in Parliament and her speech will be telecast live on NDTV. We will also be running a live blog where users can find real-time updates on the Budget presentation.

When the Interim Budget was presented last time?

Just like this year, the last interim budget was presented in 2019 by then Finance Minister Piyush Goyal. He was given the additional charge of the Finance Ministry due to Mr Jaitley's health issues.

Mr Goyal had announced some crucial changes in that year's interim budget, presented on February 1, 2019. These were: Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, creation of Department of Fisheries, Rashtriya Gokul Mission, allocation of Rs 1.58 lakh crore for the Railways and Rs 19,000 crore for construction of rural roads under Gram Sadak yojana. Mr Goyal had also announced that individual taxpayers having taxable annual income up to Rs 5 lakhs will not be required to pay any income tax.

What will happen to the economic survey?

The economic survey is one of the integral part of the entire Budget exercise, but this year, the government will not present the document.

Instead, the Centre has come out with a report on India's journey from the past 10 years titled 'Indian Economy: A Review', said Chief Economic Advisor (CEA), V Anantha Nageswaran.

India's first Economic Survey was presented in 1950-51. The document was presented with the Union Budget till 1964. Later, it was separated and presented before the Budget announcement.

There are some common financial terms associated with the Budget. Here's a look at them:

Annual Financial Statement: This is a document presented to Parliament every financial year as part of the Budget process, as required under Article 112 of the Constitution of India. Usually, this document is divided into Consolidated Fund, Contingency Fund and Public Account.

Economic Survey: This is the document that's unveiled by the government a day before the Union Budget. The Economic Survey provides an overview of economic performance and the key macroeconomic indicators.

Tax regime: This defines the tax slabs and rates for salaried and other earning individuals. The government had introduced an optional simplified income tax regime, known as New Tax Regime in 2020. Under the New Tax Regime, the government reduced the tax rates for different slabs. In the last Union Budget, Ms Sitharaman introduced the New Tax Regime as the default option.

Money Bill: It is a specific type of Finance Bill that deals with matters related to taxes, revenues and government expenditure. A bill will be treated as a Money Bill only if it contains the matters specified under Article 110 (1) (a) to (g) of the Constitution of India. The Money Bill can only be presented in the Lok Sabha.

Finance Bill: A Finance Bill is a key Budget document as it contains all details of the government revenue, expenditures and allocations for a financial year. It contains all the details about new taxes and alterations to existing tax structures. The Finance Bill is presented for a period of one year and after the bill is passed it becomes the Finance Act. The Finance Bill is prepared as per the provision under Article 117 of the Constitution of India.

Fiscal Deficit: This is the difference between the government's total expenditure and the revenue receipts in a financial year. To bridge this gap, the government adopts several measures, including borrowing funds from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Gross Domestic Product (GDP): One of the most commonly used macroeconomic indicators, GDP serves as an important tool to judge how an economy is performing. It is the total value of consumer goods and services produced domestically in a country, within a given period of time.

Budget estimates: With regards to the Union Budget, the Budget estimates refer to the estimated funds allocated to various ministries, departments, sectors and schemes of the central government. It determines the costs that will be incurred over a specific time period as well as how and where the money will be used.

Capital expenditure: Capital expenditure includes the money that the Centre proposes to allocate for the various developmental projects, acquisition, or depreciation of machinery and assets linked with economic development.",Left,,https://www.ndtv.com/business-news/budget-2024-faqs-what-you-need-to-know-4954717
