hindustantimes.com,"Budget 2024–25: Empowering women, advancing social justice","The Union Budget 2024–25 epitomises the government’s commitment to balancing high capital expenditures with robust welfare spending. This budget is designed to empower every section of society, driving socio-economic growth and development across the nation. It will empower every section of society. It reflects the government's dedication to ensuring that all Indians, irrespective of religion, caste, gender, and age, make substantial progress in realising their life goals and aspirations. The government has placed a strong emphasis on inclusive growth, focusing on four major segments of society: Garib (poor), Mahilayen (women), Yuva (youth), and Annadata (farmers).

Despite global economic uncertainties, including elevated asset prices, political instability, and shipping disruptions, India’s economic growth remains a beacon of stability. India's inflation remains low and stable, moving towards the 4% target, with core inflation (non-food, non-fuel) currently at 3.1%. Proactive government steps to ensure adequate market supplies of perishable goods have contributed significantly to this stability.

The budget marks a significant stride in promoting socio-economic development, with a strong focus on women's empowerment and social justice. The ministry of women and child development's budget has increased by 3%, from ₹25,449 crore in FY 23–24 to ₹26,092 crore in FY 24–25. Meanwhile, the department of social justice and empowerment has seen a substantial 32% increase, from ₹9,853 crore in FY 23–24 to ₹13,000 crore in FY 24–25. The budget for the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities remains unchanged at ₹1,225 crore.

The government has allocated over ₹3 lakh crore for schemes benefiting women and girls, aiming to foster women-led development. This historic allocation emphasises the government's commitment to empowering women and enhancing their role in the workforce. Key initiatives include the establishment of working women hostels in collaboration with industry partners and the creation of creches to facilitate higher participation of women in the workforce. These hostels will provide safe and convenient living arrangements for working women, while creches will support working mothers by offering reliable childcare services.

Furthermore, the government plans to partner with industries to organise women-specific skilling programmes and promote market access for women-led Self-Help Group (SHG) enterprises. These initiatives are designed to equip women with the skills needed to thrive in the workforce and support their entrepreneurial ventures, thereby driving economic growth and development.

To achieve social justice comprehensively, the government will adopt a saturation approach, ensuring that all eligible individuals are covered by various programmes, including those focused on education and health. This approach aims to empower marginalised communities by improving their capabilities and providing them with the tools needed to succeed.

Mission Shakti, a flagship initiative aimed at the empowerment of women, comprises two key components: Sambal and Samarthya. The budget for Sambal, which includes schemes for the safety and security of women, has increased from ₹462 crore in FY 23–24 to ₹629 crore in FY 24–25. This funding boost will enhance efforts to protect women from violence and ensure their safety in public and private spaces.

Samarthya, focused on the empowerment of women, has seen its allocation rise from ₹1,864 crore in FY 23–24 to ₹2,517 crore in FY 24–25. This increased funding will support various initiatives aimed at empowering women through education, skill development, and economic opportunities. By investing in these programmes, the government is fostering an environment where women can thrive and contribute to the nation's growth.

The government is committed to all-round and all-inclusive development, with a particular focus on enhancing welfare programmes for marginalised communities and improving infrastructure for social services. Central sector schemes, such as the Scholarships for Higher Education for Young Achievers Scheme for Scheduled Castes, are among the focus areas of the budget. These initiatives aim to provide educational opportunities and support to underprivileged communities, enabling them to break the cycle of poverty and achieve their full potential.

The budget underscores the government's dedication to women's empowerment and social justice. With the highest allocation for women-centric schemes in over a decade, the budget reflects a clear vision of women-led development and economic empowerment. By increasing the participation of women in the workforce, providing skilling programmes, and enabling greater market access for women SHGs, the government is paving the way for a more inclusive and equitable society.

In addition to empowering women, the budget's focus on social justice initiatives ensures that marginalised communities receive the support they need to thrive. The increased funding for critical programmes and the adoption of a comprehensive approach to social justice demonstrate the government's commitment to creating a more just and equitable society for all.

As India continues to progress towards becoming a developed nation, the budget serves as a testament to the government's unwavering commitment to fostering inclusive growth and empowering all citizens, regardless of their gender or socio-economic status.

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024-25: India's energy transition plan,"India, targeting a $7 trillion economy and decarbonisation target by achieving 500 GW of fossil-fuel free generating capacity by 2030, needs a well-rounded strategy that harmonises economic development with environmental sustainability. To reach India’s goal of achieving 50 percent of its total installed power generation capacity come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, India must install approximately 50 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity annually for the next five years, starting in 2024. Currently, India has only been able to add around 15 GW per year. The union budget 2024-25 identified energy as a priority sector, with an overall allocation of an estimated ₹68,769 crores, a significant decrease from the previous year's allocation of ₹94,915 crores. The budget emphasises the development of new strategies for strengthening the transition to renewable energy sources and promoting energy security in terms of “accessibility, affordability, and availability.” Wind energy plant (AP)

The Union budget has announced several initiatives including pumped storage, nuclear and thermal plants. The growth of nuclear energy in the form of small modular reactors has been emphasised, with the government planning to make it a significant portion of the energy mix for Viksit Bharat. To facilitate this, the government plans to partner with the private sector to set up Bharat Small Reactors and aims to enhance the research and development of Bharat Small Modular Reactors and newer nuclear technologies.

Although small modular reactors represent an opportunity for India to augment its energy capacity, its development along the lines of accessibility, affordability and availability could pose challenges in future, raising questions about the feasibility of the initiative. Estimates by Now Solar, an India focused renewable energy advisory and management organisation, indicate that small modular nuclear reactors are expected to be the most costly source of power and are unlikely to be available before 2030. Although a bold initiative aimed at expanding the nuclear energy component in the energy mix of India, questions regarding its economic viability remain unanswered. Over the years, nuclear policies have predominantly centred on large nuclear reactors, with no initiatives in place to foster demand and create a level playing field for new market entrants. Additionally, some nuclear reactors are under International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards due to their use of imported uranium. Without policies to stimulate market demand, this initiative risks becoming another failure. Programmes and schemes aimed at gradually phasing out fossil fuels such as harnessing of wind energy and integration of compressed biogas into the natural gas failed to receive a mention in the budget speech. The focus on nuclear energy also raises questions on the potential sidelining of such projects in the future.

The interim budget included numerous announcements to promote green growth, with rooftop solarisation receiving a modest mention. In line with the interim budget announcement, the Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana was launched to install rooftop solar plants in 1 crore households, providing up to 300 units of free electricity per month. This scheme has seen significant interest, with over 1.28 crore registrations and 14 lakh applications, as disclosed by the finance minister in the recent budget speech. The applications received account for only about 11% of total registrations, largely because the final approval for installing solar rooftops lies with the respective state electricity boards. The capacity of solar plants depends on the transformer capacity of the area, making it challenging for state electricity boards to approve the applications. The state electricity boards, with their existing grid capacity, will not be able to approve the installations until there is an upgrade in the grid infrastructure.

The celebrated FAME Scheme, which has significantly multiplied electric vehicle (EV) registrations in the country to over 13 lakhs, is seeing a reduction in budget allocation. According to the budget estimates, the allocation for the upcoming fiscal year is 2,671 crores, as against 5,171 crores in the previous financial year. However, players can breathe a sigh of relief with the exemption of customs duties on lithium and cobalt, the two main components for lithium-ion batteries. This could pave the way for localised manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles, significantly reducing production costs and eventually making the process more cost-effective. While the boost for incentives for electric vehicles is beneficial in cutting down the tail-end emissions, there is a downside. With the increasing private vehicular population, governments often overlook the importance of public transport, particularly the rollout of electric buses. The allocations for electric buses in the union budget remained the same as those in the interim budget. To reduce overall private vehicle congestion and address vehicular pollution, there should be more focus on promoting electric buses compared to private electric vehicles. Increasing the number of buses and reducing private vehicle use can lead to a reduction in overall emissions.

Overall, while promoting economic growth along with a phased transition to renewable energy sources, presents opportunities for making India a hub of energy security by 2030, a much-anticipated year in the discourse of global sustainable development. However, the budget seems to fall short in providing clear insights into the prolonged advancement of the anticipated schemes. There is uncertainty whether these schemes will achieve their intended long-term goals due to the absence of continued and sustainable allocations in the budget. The prospect of nuclear energy gaining a focal point over the other established sources of renewable energy, despite concerns about its cost, availability and safety exemplifies the same. The inconsistent allocations across different schemes create confusion, creating a disconnect between the energy aspirations and the pronounced goals. While the budget speaks of new volumes for the advancement of sustainability, the success of the various announced schemes can only be determined with time.

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: How removing indexation benefits for capital gains tax on property may impact the Mumbai real estate market,"Mumbai’s resale real estate market is expected to feel the pinch with Budget 2024 doing away with the indexation benefits on long-term capital gains (LTCG) on sale of property. Mumbai’s resale real estate market is expected to feel the pinch with Budget 2024-2025 doing away with the indexation benefit on long-term capital gains (LTCG) on sale of property. (Picture for representational purposes)(Mehul R Thakkar/HT)

According to experts, the Mumbai real estate market is primarily led by buyers who sell small units to upgrade to larger homes. This coupled with the performance of the stock market and the upcoming assembly elections in the state may lead to property transactions cooling off in Mumbai.

Union Budget 2024-2025 proposals

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 24 had proposed to do away with the indexation benefit on sale of property, that allowed home owners the benefit of adjusting their gains against inflation. This, say real estate experts, may lead to higher tax burden on real estate transactions and severely impact property sellers.

The long-term capital gains (LTCG) has been reduced from 20% with indexation benefit to 12.5% without indexation for the real estate sector.

What is indexation?

Indexation allows one to adjust the purchase price of an asset for inflation, reducing taxable profits and tax liabilities. Without this adjustment, individuals paying tax may have to pay increased taxes despite the lower LTCG rate.



What does this mean for the Mumbai real estate market?

According to real estate experts, removal of indexation will slow down sales in the secondary market, also known as resale market in metro cities, including the Mumbai real estate market.

""The overall real estate market in Mumbai and other metro cities might be affected wherein resale transactions may slow down in the secondary market, not only in Mumbai but also in other metro cities. The mid-segment market, specifically in the range of ₹2 to ₹5 crore might be impacted and even investors might put their decision to sell on hold. Investors will now wait and watch before exiting from the property market now. Having said this, it depends on individual investment goals,” said Ritesh Mehta, Senior Director, and Head (North and West), residential services and developer initiative, JLL India, a real estate consultancy firm.

""However, it also depends on how the Indian stock market performs in the coming months. Real estate transactions are also connected with the performance of the Indian stock market,"" he added.

Another expert not wishing to be named said, ""The mid-segment and luxury segment of Mumbai real estate market is already overheated and is likely to cool off in the coming months. While we cannot say that there will be a drastic downfall, the market will reflect these changes.""

""The state of Maharashtra is expected to go for polls in the next two to three months and hence there will not be too many transactions by investors. Investors, including developers, are in a wait-and-watch mode and therefore we may see some stagnancy. While we do not see any slowdown and properties are getting registered, we have to understand that these deals were finalized in the last 90 days. Typically, the real impact of removal of the indexation benefit may be felt over the next six to nine months.""

On an average, the Mumbai real estate market has reported over 10,000 property registrations on a monthly basis of which 80% of the property registrations are in the residential segment. Experts opine that out of these 80%, a significant portion of homebuying happens on account of buyers upgrading their homes, especially post Covid-19.



Higher taxation may lead to short term disruption in the secondary real estate market

Vivek Rathi, National Director, Research, Knight Frank India, a real estate consultancy firm said, ""There could be a short term impact where the market adjusts itself to the new reality. Eventually market conditions are expected to normalize. There might be a short-term adjustment period as the market adapts to the new conditions. However, market conditions are expected to stabilize over time.""

Rathi added that if the property's value has risen more than the inflation rate, the new 12.5% tax rate is likely to be more favorable for real estate sellers compared to the previous 20% rate after adjusting for indexation.



What does removal of indexation benefit mean for plotted developments?

Investments in plotted developments picked up post Covid-19. However, real estate developers are of the opinion that the impact of changes in LTCG on plotted developments or other real estate segments is similar.

""The House of Abhinandan Lodha (HoABL) has been offering plotted developments for the past three years, and our advice to our customers has been to buy land if you plan to hold it for more than 10 years. However, if investors seek an early exit to meet any contingencies, the reduced LTCG rate from 20% to 12.5%, along with the shortened holding period from three years to two years, makes exit more attractive. While we still recommend long-term holdings, these changes offer greater flexibility for investors,"" said Abhinandan Lodha, chairman, HoABL.

On the impact of removal of indexation benefit on vertical developments, Abhinandan Lodha said that the “vertical real estate market, particularly in metros, has generally provided single-digit compounded returns and hence investors and HNIs looking to exit now will benefit from the reduced tax rate of 12.5%.""",,Center-Right,https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/budget-2024-how-removing-indexation-benefits-for-capital-gains-tax-on-property-may-impact-the-mumbai-real-estate-market-101722826702109.html

Discussions on the Union Budget and the budget of Jammu and Kashmir, are set to continue in both houses of Parliament.



In addition to addressing queries from the budget discussions, the agenda of the parliament includes Nirmala Sitharaman introducing The Jammu and Kashmir Appropriation (No. 3) Bill, 2024.



The bill seeks to authorise the payment and appropriation of certain sums from the Consolidated Fund of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir from 2024-25.

On Monday, Leader of Opposition, Rahul Gandhi, critiqued the budget for not addressing demonetisation, high taxation and also took a dig at the ‘halwa ceremony’ conducted by the finance minister.

He said, “The budget halwa is being distributed and in this picture not a single OBC officer is visible. Even a tribal officer and a Dalit officer are not visible. The country's halwa is being distributed and they are not the only ones involved in it.”

Invoking the concept of ‘Chakravyuh’, the Congress MP said that the budget has contributed to the trap of youth facing unemployment, farmers in debt, middle class dealing with tax, MSMEs in tax terrorism, jawans under Agnipath and injustices against SC, ST, OBC and minority communities.

In a post on X he also criticised the lack of focus on education, “The Education budget, at 2.5% it is the lowest in 20 years and at a time when our students are suffering from widespread Paper Leaks, the FM did not deem it fit to even mention the crisis in her speech.”

hindustantimes.com,Should you buy gold after recent price drop following Union Budget 2024?,"Gold prices on the MCX traded higher on Monday, July 29, after dropping more than 4% overall in July. The fall was primarily due to the government announcing customs duty cuts on gold in the Union Budget 2024. Gold prices on the MCX traded higher on Monday, July 29, after dropping more than 4% overall in July (Representational Image/Unsplash)



What are the current gold prices and the gold prices earlier in July?

Gold rates on the MCS was up by 0.35% or ₹242, trading at ₹68,428 for 10 grams, while silver gained even more at 0.66% or ₹538, trading at ₹81,909 per kg. Spot gold prices on the international market was $2,392.32, a gain of 0.21% or $5.13, according to Bloomberg data.

In the beginning of July, gold prices on the MCX hovered at ₹71,600 per 10 grams and hit a high of around ₹74,730 in the middle of the month. After the Union Budget 2024 was presented, the prices fell sharply, hitting a monthly low of around ₹67,400 last week.

What are some experts' views on gold prices?

However, gold prices are expected to rice due to increasing hopes of interest rate cuts by the US Fed, softness in US dollar index, escalating global geopolitical tensions, and increasing physical demand in domestic markets after duty adjustments, according to a Mint report, which quoted Ajay Kedia, Director, Kedia Advisory, who is also pessimistic on silver due to weak data from China and increasing gold-silver ratio.



The report also quoted Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst of Currencies & Commodities at Reliance Securities who said, “The Fed is likely to hold rates steady as the market largely discounts a rate cut in September. BoJ is forecast to increase the rate and the Bank of England may cut the rate under the new government. The dollar index is struggling around the 104.30 mark. Moreover, the US will also come out with July non farm payrolls number. Hence from an economic data point of view, the week is crucial.”

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: Will real estate developers turn focus on affordable housing after revival of interest subsidy scheme?,"In a major push to revive supply in the affordable housing segment, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23 announced a sizable outlay of ₹10 lakh crore under the PM Awas Yojana Urban 2.0. Revival of CLSS scheme is expected to boost supply of affordable housing stock in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, as per expexts (Representational photo)(HT Archive)

Budget 2024 has also brought back interest subsidy under the flagship scheme setting aside ₹4,000 crore for the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS). The revival of the scheme, say real estate experts, is expected to boost affordability of prospective homebuyers and may increase the supply of the affordable housing stock in peripheral locations of Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities recently connected with new infrastructure.

This is what Budget 2024 has proposed for affordable housing

In the Union Budget for financial year 2024-25, PMAY-U has been allocated ₹30,170 crore, an increase of 20.19% from the 2023-2024 budgetary allocation.

According to the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, the interest subsidy scheme can soon be availed by the economically weaker section (EWS), lower income group (LIG) and middle-income group.

Nearly two years ago, the government did not extend the time period of CLSS under PMAY, which provided subsidized home loans based on income. At present, the scheme is being implemented through three verticals – beneficiary led construction/enhancement, affordable housing in partnership and in-situ slum redevelopment.

Presenting the Union Budget for 2024-25 in the Lok Sabha on July 24, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that three crore additional houses under the PM Awas Yojana in rural and urban areas will be constructed, for which the necessary allocations are being made. According to the budgetary document, ₹3,000 crore has been allocated for EWS and LIG groups to construct houses under CLSS in urban areas while the middle-income group will be provided ₹1,000 crore.



Sitharaman announced central assistance of ₹2.2 lakh crore over the next five years to meet housing requirements of one crore urban poor and middle-class families under the PMAY-U and proposed interest subsidy to provide loans at affordable rates.

Ministry officials have been quoted as saying that modalities of the PMAY-U 2.0 have been worked out and the second phase of PMAY-U will be launched soon.

Under CLSS scheme 1.0 launched earlier, MIG I category consisting of individuals with an annual income of ₹6-12 lakh were given an interest subsidy of 4% provided on a loan of up to ₹9 lakh. For the MIG II category, which was made up of individuals with an annual income of ₹12-18 lakh, an interest subsidy of 3% was given on a loan of up to ₹12 lakh. The benefits were typically in the ₹2-2.5 lakh range. The carpet area of a housing unit was initially revised to up to 120 sq m and up to 150 sq m for MIG I and MIG II respectively in November 2017 and further enhanced to up to 160 sq m and up to 200 sq m for MIG I and MIG II, respectively in June 2018.

Details for CLSS 2.0 have not yet been released.

Revival of CLSS scheme to boost supply of affordable housing stock in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities

CLSS 2.0, the fine print for which is yet to be released, is an opportunity for real estate developers going forward. “What it does is to bring down the cost of funding as buyers would have to pay less interest on home loans. It will also increase homebuyers’ eligibility to apply for a home loan,” said Vipul Roongta, Managing Director and CEO of HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd.

Most developers have focused on launching luxury housing projects after Covid-19 but that is not to say that the demand for affordable housing has gone down. It is the supply of affordable housing which has decreased because there is greater viability for luxury housing projects. Having said that, it’s not that developers will suddenly change track and start launching only affordable or mid housing segments, he explained.

“I don’t see any reason why both the guns should not be firing simultaneously - affordable and luxury. Going forward, I see supply for affordable housing definitely going up in a big way.”

Much of this affordable housing supply may come up along new infrastructure corridors such as highways, RRTS and the Metro.

One big positive in the Indian context is that road and metro connectivity in all the top cities has significantly gone up. Several affordable housing projects may be launched within 45-minutes of the Central Business Districts in major cities. That will be because land prices in these zones will be more compatible to construct affordable housing.

“We may see a lot of action in areas along the Yamuna Expressway, Sonipat, Panipat, Manesar, Meerut, Nasik, Nagpur, Panvel, Mysuru and other peripheral areas in big cities among others,” he said.

Developers’ decision to launch projects will depend on the cost at which they bought the land, the cost of construction and the cost of FSI.

""Tier II and III cities will become the nerve centres of a lot of development and see growth in the affordable and mid segment housing,"" said Boman Irani, president, CREDAI, however adding that the government should make size, as opposed to price, the indicator of affordable housing.

Real estate experts said that developers that were primarily into affordable housing and changed track to launch premium housing may also decide to launch projects in this segment again.

Success of the affordable housing scheme depends on steps taken by the state governments

The government's decision to bring back the interest subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) 2.0 and set aside ₹4,000 crore for Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) is a positive step, experts said.

They pointed out that the success of this scheme depends on the affordable housing schemes that are eventually rolled out by the respective state governments as land is a state subject.

“It may be worthwhile to set aside agricultural lands along newly built infrastructure as residential for the purpose of affordable housing where the size of homes could be defined by the government,” they said.

Pradeep Aggarwal, founder and chairman, Signature Global (India) Ltd, a company that pioneered affordable housing in Gurugram, is of the opinion that the government's decision to reinstate the interest subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) 2.0, along with the ₹4,000 crore allocation for the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), marks a significant and welcome step. This initiative, coupled with the construction of three crore additional houses in rural and urban areas, underscores a strong commitment to making homeownership more accessible for many families.

“The collaboration between the central and state governments in promoting affordable housing will be crucial for the success of this scheme. We request that agricultural lands be strategically utilized along newly developed infrastructure for residential purposes. As a developer, we can ensure the effective implementation of these projects, providing quality and affordable homes to those who need them most,"" he said.

Pankaj Kapoor of Liases Foras said that the demand for housing priced less than ₹45 lakh has reduced over the years. It constitutes just about 10 to 15% of the total housing units sold. In 2017-2018, Tier 2 cities contributed to close to about 30% of affordable housing demand which is down to almost 20% today. “The renewal of the CLSS scheme would mean revival of affordable housing in peripheral areas of Tier 1 and in Tier 2 cities, especially those located along the new and upcoming infrastructure in the next two to three years,” he added.



According to a report by property consultancy Knight Frank India, the budget housing segment across the top eight cities in India, comprising residential units priced under ₹50 lakh, has seen a sustained deceleration in sales for the past five consecutive half-yearly periods.

“I don’t see a shift in the focus of developers who are present in the luxury segment for higher margins,” said Saandip Kundu, CEO, RMZ Living. However, the affordable housing segment is expected to grow parallelly, driven by players who have been active in the segment so far, he added.

Others agreed. “Players in Tier 2 and 3 cities whose core expertise lie in the semi-affordable segment are likely to account for this anticipated growth,” said Ritesh Mehta, Senior Director, and Head (North and West), Residential Services and Developer Initiative, JLL India.



Byproduct of fillip for rental housing

Interestingly, the Modi 3.0 government also unveiled plans to facilitate rental housing for industrial workers in partnership with the private sector.

“Rental housing with dormitory type accommodation for industrial workers will be facilitated in PPP mode with VGF (viability gap funding) support and commitment from anchor industries,” Sitharaman underscored.

This may be a sweet spot for both parties in the equation. Several sectoral experts believe that this could be a pilot, which if proven successful, may unlock massive opportunities for real estate developers across the country. Realty players eagerly await a fine print of the plans to assess the potential of this model.



“If this works well, then who knows, this may expand on public-private partnership to bring affordable housing on rental basis to larger cities, urban areas,"" said Anuj Puri, Chairman, ANAROCK Group. He emphasized that the said move may be the start of a much bigger opportunity where developers may benefit over a period of time if the experience goes well.",Center,Center,https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/budget-2024-will-real-estate-developers-turn-focus-on-affordable-housing-after-revival-of-interest-subsidy-scheme-101721894753924.html
hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: Is the new income tax regime beneficial for all salaried taxpayers?,"The government is nudging salaried income taxpayers to move to a new regime, which it says is simpler and offers lower rates of taxes. The new regime was announced in the Union budget for 2020-21 and it co-exists with the old tax regime. Salaried taxpayers are free to choose either regime when they file their returns but for those with income from business or profession, the new regime is the default regime from this assessment year (2024-25). Budget 2024: Union Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. (Ajay Aggarwal/HT Photo)

To make the new regime more popular among the salaried, the government announced an increase in the standard deduction and tweaked the tax slabs. These changes can result in additional savings of up to ₹17,500 for salaried taxpayers who have migrated to the new tax regime.

How are the two regimes different?

The old regime allows taxpayers to claim a plethora of deductions and rebates to lower their tax liability. Claiming these rebates and deductions is not simple and straightforward for many small taxpayers. Deductions and rebates allowed include those under Chapter VI A of the Income Tax Act such as the popular Section 80C deductions. That apart, taxpayers availing a home loan to buy a house were allowed to reduce interest on loan from their income to calculate taxable income. The old regime allowed tax planning using a range of investment instruments and expenditures.

The new tax regime, in contrast, does away with the need for tax planning as it is simpler and allows fewer deductions. Standard deduction is one of the few deduction currently allowed under the new tax regime.

In her 2020 budget speech introducing the new tax regime, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman noted that the income tax law allowed more than 100 exemptions and deductions. The government removed around 70 of them in the new simplified regime. The remaining exemptions and deductions are to be reviewed and rationalised in the subsequent years.

Is the new regime more fair than the old regime?

It is fairer to those who cannot take advantage of deductions and rebates allowed under the old tax regime such as 80C investment and do not have an outstanding home loan on a self-occupied house. These are individuals who do not have much surplus to invest in various tax saving and social security instruments such as the public provident fund (PPF). The younger salaried taxpayers in particular will find the new regime beneficial due to the concessional rates of tax.

Those who had made certain investment decisions to benefit from deductions allowed under the old tax regime might not see much merit in shifting to the new regime. Their tax liability might be lower if they stay with the old regime even though the tax rates are higher. For instance, if the individual has taken a loan to buy a house for self-occupation, she cannot claim a deduction for interest paid on the loan under the new tax regime. The deduction is allowed only if the property is let out. The new regime does not allow exemption for house rent allowance.

How do the tax rates compare in the two regimes?

The tax slabs under the two regimes are quite different.

There are three tax slabs and taxable income below ₹2.50 lakh is exempt under the old tax regime for the current assessment year (2024-25). Income between ₹2.50 lakh and ₹5 lakh of individuals aged below 60 years is taxed at 5%, income between ₹5 lakh and ₹10 lakh at 20% and income above ₹10 lakh at 30%. Senior citizens and super seniors (80+) are allowed higher exemptions of ₹3 lakh and ₹5 lakh, respectively. The taxable income refers to income net of all deductions and rebates, including the standard deduction of ₹50,000. There is no change in these rates for the next assessment year.

The tax rates for the new regime are lower to compensate for removing most deductions and rebates. As mentioned earlier in the copy, additional benefits in the form of increased standard deduction and modified tax slabs will further reduce the tax liability of individuals with effect from the next assessment year. The standard deduction will rise to ₹75,000 from the current assessment year’s ₹50,000. Income up to ₹3 lakh will continue to be exempt from tax. The new regime has five slab rates – 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%.

While income between ₹3 lakh and ₹6 lakh is currently subject to a 5%, in the next assessment year, income between ₹3 lakh and ₹7 lakh will be subject to a 5% tax. The next slab of 10% will apply to income between ₹7 lakh and ₹10 lakh from next year instead of ₹6-9 lakh, and the 15% slab will apply to income between ₹10 lakh and ₹12 lakh. There is no change in the 20% and 30% rate income slabs.

Disadvantages of new regime

The old tax regime encourages people to save in tax saving instrument such as PPF, life insurance policies and equity-linked savings schemes of mutual funds. There is no such incentive to invest/save in these instruments under the new regime and these schemes may suffer in the years ahead and even lose their utility.

There will be a change in the investment behaviour of taxpayers, and it may include increased exposure to high-risk investments in equities. Conversely, some might find the removal of Section 80C beneficial for their investment and savings plans.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/budget-2024-is-the-new-income-tax-regime-beneficial-for-all-salaried-taxpayers-101721818329031.html

Nirmala Sitharaman became the first finance minister to present seven consecutive budget speeches, surpassing former prime minister Morarji Desai's record of six consecutive budgets as finance minister between 1959 and 1964. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the Union Budget 2024-25 in Lok Sabha in New Delhi on July 23.(PTI)

In her seventh record Budget, Nirmala Sitharaman outlined key priorities aimed at fostering economic growth and creating ample opportunities. These included productivity and resilience in agriculture, employment and skilling and services.

""India's economic growth continues to be the shining exception (in a world that is gripped by policy uncertainties) and will remain so in the years ahead,"" Sitharaman said while presenting the Budget in the Parliament. ""In this budget, we particularly focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class.""

Here, we take a look at the measures aimed at salaried persons and job seekers in the Union Budget 2024-25.

Hike in standard deduction

In the budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an increase in the standard deduction for salaried employees from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000 under the new income tax regime – an increase of 50%.

Standard deduction refers to a flat deduction from the total salary earned by an employee in a year before calculating the applicable income tax rate.

Notably, no change has been announced regarding the standard deduction in the old tax regime .

New income tax slabs

In her budget speech, Nirmala Sitharaman also announced relaxation in the income tax slabs under the new tax regiment for the current fiscal year.

The new income tax slabs announced are as follows:

Up to ₹ 3 lakh: 0%

3 lakh: 0% ₹ 3 to ₹ 7 lakh: 5%

3 to 7 lakh: 5% ₹ 7 lakh to ₹ 10 lakh: 10%

7 lakh to 10 lakh: 10% ₹ 10 lakh to ₹ 12 lakh: 15%

10 lakh to 12 lakh: 15% ₹ 12 lakh to ₹ 15 lakh: 20%

12 lakh to 15 lakh: 20% Above ₹ 15 lakh: 30%





“As a result of these changes, a salaried employee in the new tax regime stands to save up to ₹17,500/- in income tax,” she announced.

Increase in tax deduction on family pension

Sitharaman also announced a plan to increase the family pension deduction amount for the better financial stability of salaried individuals and pensioners.

The deduction amount is proposed to be increased to ₹25,000 from ₹15,000, under the new tax regime.

“Deduction on family pension for pensioners is proposed to be enhanced from ₹15,000 to ₹25,000,” the finance minister said, adding that the move will provide relief to about 4 crore salaried individuals and pensioners.

One month wage to all new entrants in formal sector



Nirmala Sitharaman also announced that the government will provide a one-month wage to all persons newly entering the workplace in all formal sectors. This, the finance minister said, the government will directly transfer the amount to the employees as their provident fund contribution.

""...One month's wage to all persons newly entering the workplace in all formal sectors. Direct Benefit Transfer of one month's salary in 3 instalments to first-time employees as registered in the EPFO will be up to ₹15,000. The eligibility limit will be a salary of ₹1 lakh per month. The scheme will benefit 210 lakh youth,"" the finance minister said while presenting the Budget.



The announcements were part of the prime minister's package for employment and skilling.

In addition to the direct benefit transfer, the government also announced that incentives will be provided directly to both employees and employers based on their EPFO contribution in the first four years of employment. It also announced that employers will be reimbursed up to ₹3,000 per month for two years towards their EPFO contribution for each additional employee.

Internship in top 500 companies

The finance minister also said in her budget speech on Tuesday that the government would launch an internship scheme for youth in 500 top companies.

The scheme will cover 10 million young people over five years, Sitharaman added.

Those interning will also receive an internship allowance of ₹5,000 per month and a one-time assistance of ₹6,000.

“As the 5th scheme under the Prime Minister’s package, our government will launch a comprehensive scheme for providing internship opportunities in 500 top companies to 1 crore youth in 5 years. They will gain exposure for 12 months to real-life business environment, varied professions and employment opportunities,” she said in the Parliament.

“…Companies will be expected to bear the training cost and 10% of the internship cost from their CSR funds,” she added.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/budget-2024-income-tax-rate-jobs-internship-nirmala-sitharaman-july-24-101721782115488.html

The new tax regime has been the default tax regime since April 1, 2023, but there is the option for employees to switch to the old regime by specifically informing the employer. This choice can only be made once a year and it would have already been done at the beginning of this financial year.

However, since the slabs have now been changed even for the new tax regime, there may be the option to choose again, for the purpose of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on the salary as the changes are effective from April 1, 2024 itself, according to an Economic Times report, which added that if that is the case, it is also an opportunity for those still under the old tax regime to switch to the new regime since the new regime has been made more and more attractive by the government in a move to increase the number of people who adopt it.

Those who already are opted for the new tax regime may also see decreasing taxes once the proposals are passed by the Parliament and receive President’s assent, the report read.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/union-budget-2024-reforms-of-the-new-tax-regime-may-reduce-tax-burden-and-allow-option-to-choose-again-101721814742709.html
hindustantimes.com,Union Budget 2024-25: Coalition Economix,"The Union Budget on Tuesday unveiled a concerted jobs push and a raft of schemes for young people ranging from internship guarantees to employment-linked incentives even as it laid out a bouquet of sops for critical allies and attempted to balance the exigencies of running a coalition with maintaining fiscal discipline. Nirmala Sitharaman addresses a post-Budget press conference. (PTI)

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s second-shortest budget speech, and her seventh overall, also focussed on changes in direct and indirect tax regimes – including a hike in long term capital gains tax for listed assets from 10% to 12.5% , the scrapping of indexation (which took inflation into account while calculating asset values) and introduction of a flat 12.5% rate for real-estate , the removal of the angel tax for all investors, and a sharp reduction in customs duties for items such as gold, silver and mobile phones, which will make these items cheaper for consumers.

She announced some tweaks in the new tax regime that will save taxpayers up to ₹17,500 annually and a review of the income tax act, hinted that the government was moving towards next-generation reforms, and announced that the fiscal deficit stood at 4.9%, keeping India firmly on the fiscal glide path first announced three years ago.

“The #BudgetForViksitBharat ensures inclusive growth, benefiting every segment of society and paving the way for a developed India,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.

The budget largely steered away from populist announcements, although chunks of the 85-minute budget speech were devoted to schemes and sops aimed at Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, two states governed by allies Janata Dal (United) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) whose support is crucial for the survival of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government.

Sitharaman announced a cluster of projects and packages – roads and highways, airports, flood control, irrigation schemes, tourist hubs, industrial nodes and power projects – totalling roughly ₹59,000crore for Bihar, which goes to the polls next year.

For Andhra Pradesh, the finance minister announced ₹15,000 crore for the construction of the state capital Amaravati and additional funds if required, completion of the Polavaram dam project and two industrial nodes. “Our government has made efforts to fulfil the commitments in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Recognising the state’s need for capital, we will facilitate special financial support through multilateral agencies,” Sitharaman added.

The Opposition flayed the budget, pointing out that not only did it not contain specific schemes for other states but also held little for Maharashtra and Haryana, two states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that are slated to go to the polls later this year. The Congress also alleged that two of the five schemes announced for young people were lifted from its manifesto.

“Kursi Bachao [save your chair] Budget. Appease Allies: Hollow promises to them at the cost of other states. Appease Cronies: Benefits to AA with no relief for the common Indian. Copy and Paste: Congress manifesto and previous budgets,” Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi said on X.

But NDA members welcomed the announcements. “From the beginning, we had requested special assistance for Bihar. In response, they have announced help in several areas. We are doing a lot of work, and we will receive additional support in many aspects, which will be beneficial,” said a beaming Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar.

This was the first budget presented by the third iteration of the NDA, mere weeks after the BJP suffered a setback in the general elections and failed to garner a simple majority in the Lok Sabha. The party won 240 seats in the 543-member House, giving space to allies to make greater demands for their respective states.

Key highlights of Union Budget 2024-25.

The BJP’s sobering performance was attributed to slipping support among key demographics such as young people, women, marginalised castes and rural poor over bread-and-butter issues such as a crippling lack of jobs.

The budget sought to address this lacunae by unveiling nine priority areas for the government – productivity and resilience in agriculture; employment and skilling; inclusive human resource development and social justice;manufacturing and services; urban development;energy security;infrastructure; innovation, research, and development; and next-generation reforms – while maintaining fiscal prudence.

The sharpest focus was on young people. The government announced five schemes with an aggregate spend of around ₹2 lakh crore for roughly 41 million people – it will pay one month’s wage up to ₹15,000 in three instalments to every new person entering the workforce, incentivise employers up to ₹3,000 a month for two years towards their EPFO contribution for new employees, offer a direct incentive to both employer and employee for their EPFO contribution for the first four four years, skill two million people over five years, and offer internship opportunities at 500 top companies for 10 million people over five years. The focus was on generating employment, a key grassroots grievance that hurt the BJP in the recently concluded polls. In addition to the five schemes listed above, the government also announced upgradation of 1,000 Industrial Training Institutes, government-backed skilling loans up to ₹7.5 lakh and financial support for loans up to ₹10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions, making up its second thrust area – jobs.

Sitharaman made further commitments to women, including working women’s hostels and cheap loans. “For promoting women-led development, the Budget carries an allocation of more than ₹ 3 lakh crore for schemes benefitting women and girls,” she said.

A third priority of the budget was maintaining fiscal discipline. It lowered its fiscal deficit target for the current year to 4.9% of the Gross Domestic Product, from the 5.1% target set in the interim budget in February and from 5.6% in the previous year. It lowered its gross borrowing target to ₹14.01 lakh crore rupees but said it still plans to spend a record ₹11.11 lakh crore rupees in capital expenditure on long-term infrastructure.

“The fiscal consolidation path announced by me in 2021 has served our economy very well, and we aim to reach a deficit below 4.5% next year. The government is committed to staying the course. From 2026-27 onwards, our endeavour will be to keep the fiscal deficit each year such that the central government debt will be on a declining path as a percentage of GDP,” Sitharaman said.

A revenue windfall this year has boosted the government coffers, giving it ample resources to boost spending while narrowing the fiscal deficit. The Reserve Bank of India paid the government a record ₹2.1 lakh crore dividend this year, while tax revenues surged on the back of a stronger economy.

Taxes were a fourth key area. The government raised the short-term capital gains tax – on stocks held for less than one year – to 20% from 15%, and the long-term capital gains tax – for stocks held for over one year – to 12.5% from 10%. The step was seen as an effort to arrest the frenzy that has propelled the markets to record highs, a day after the economic survey sounded a word of caution on galloping markets. It caused a temporary slide in India’s benchmark indices but they recovered shortly after and ended the day flat.

Sitharaman reduced customs duties on items ranging from cancer drugs, mobile phones, chargers, seafood, gold, critical minerals and seafood. She also tweaked the new tax regime slabs and raised the standard deduction limit from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000. “As a result of these changes, a salaried employee in the new tax regime stands to save up to ₹ 17,500 in income tax,” she said.

There were a string of other announcements – more funding for agricultural research, a movement towards small nuclear reactors and solar power for energy security, credit guarantee schemes and cheap loans for micro, small and medium enterprises, expanded urban housing, a new scheme for tribal people, and digitised land records – that hinted that the government was thinking about initiating next-generation reforms and a simplification of the tax framework.

But the four main priorities outlined the government’s immediate and medium-term outlook – resolve the lingering problem around too few new jobs, win back key demographics such as young people disillusioned over bread-and-butter issues, shun populism as much as possible by training focus on fiscal prudence, but also ensure that allies critical to its survival remain in good humour.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-budget-2024-25-coalition-economix-101721788717382.html
hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: These are the winners and losers of ‘vulnerable’ stock market,"Domestic brokerage firm Emkay Global called the Union Budget 2024 ‘solid’ highlighting policy continuity. Fiscal consolidation path was maintained and the focus on capital expenditure continued, it said. A small hike in capital gains tax was not material while direct incentives for employment was a big measure, it said. On the stock market, the brokerage said, “The stock market is vulnerable at these valuations and could correct in the short term. Our favored sectors are FMCG, IT and consumer durables, and we are negative on industrials and financials.” Stock market today: A bird flies past a screen displaying the Sensex results on the facade of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) building in Mumbai.(Reuters)

Emkay Global said it remains cautious on the market as the Budget is unlikely to move the needle significantly.

""On the other hand, we are looking at a tepid earnings season, as topline growth remains moderate and margin tailwinds are petering out. Also, rate cuts are at least 1-2 quarters away. On the other hand, valuations are stretched at 21.4 (1-year forward P/E of Nifty), with no imminent upgrades,"" it said.

Increase in LTCG and STCG has been marginal and is not a major worry although tax on buyback could adversely affect payouts, it said. The increase in STT on derivatives is also relatively minor, it noted, adding, “Overall, the increase in taxes on capital markets has not been severe and is unlikely to affect market valuations materially.”

Retail, NBFCs, and MFIs in growth mode could see some benefits too, it said, explaining, “The other is that half the windfall gain from the RBI dividend was diverted to revex, with transfers to states the most prominent expenditure head. We see both as positive, and address the K-shaped post-Covid recovery. Our positive stance on FMCG and two-wheelers is reinforced by these moves.”

Emkay Global noted two positives in the budget- first for the jewellery sector which is set to benefit from the cut in gold import duties, and second are battery players who are likely to gain from lower import duties on critical metals.

""Capital market participants were hit by the CGT and STT, but the impact is negligible. There was a relief rally in some stocks, as there were expectations of more severe measures, especially on derivatives trading,"" it said.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/budget-2024-these-are-the-winners-and-losers-of-vulnerable-stock-market-101721791395546.html

For rural land reforms, the measures include assigning Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) or “Bhu-Aadhaar” for all lands, digitization of cadastral maps, survey of map sub-divisions as per current ownership, establishment of land registry and linking it to the farmers registry.

In urban areas, land will be digitised with help of GIS mapping. An IT system will be established for property record administration, updating and tax administration. This measure aims to improve the financial position of urban local bodies.

Sitharaman said the central government would formulate an “economic policy framework” to set forth the overarching approach to economic development and set the stage for next generation reforms to facilitate employment opportunities and sustained growth.

“Our government will initiate and incentivize reforms for improving productivity of factors of production, facilitating markets and sectors to become more efficient. These reforms will cover all factors of production, namely land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship, and technology as an enabler of improving total factor productivity and bridging inequality,” she said.

Stressing that development of the country lies in the development of states, finance minister said that an effective implementation of these reforms needs consensus and collaboration between the centre and the states. """"For promoting competitive federalism and incentivizing states for faster implementation of reforms, I propose to earmark a significant part of the 50-year interest-free loan,"" she added.

Finance minister said the central government will work in partnership with states to implement these reforms in both urban and rural areas. It would also provide fiscal support to states to incentive them to complete these reforms in the next three years.

Sitharaman said that land related reforms and actions in both urban and rural areas will cover “land administration, planning and management, urban planning, usage and building bylaws. These will be incentivized for completion within the next 3 years through appropriate fiscal support.”

Aim to reach fiscal deficit below 4.5% next year: Sitharaman

For the year 2024-25, the fiscal deficit is estimated at 4.9 per cent of GDP. Total receipts, excluding borrowings, are projected at ₹32.07 lakh crore, while total expenditure is estimated at ₹48.21 lakh crore, according to FM Sitharaman.

The government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 4.5 per cent of GDP by the financial year 2025-26. The fiscal deficit is the gap between what the government earns and spends, showing how much it may need to borrow.

""The fiscal consolidation path announced by me in 2021 has served our economy very well, and we aim to reach a deficit below 4.5 per cent next year,"" Sitharaman said.

""The government is committed to stay the course. From 2026-27 onwards our endeavour will be to keep fiscal deficit each year such that the central government's debt will be on a declining path as a percentage of GDP,"" she added.

The Centre announced it will spend a record ₹11,11,000 crore on infrastructure for the financial year ending March 2025. This spending plan remains unchanged from the interim budget presented in February before the national elections.

What leaders said on Budget 2024

Union home minister Amit Shah said that the Budget would usher in a new era of employment and opportunities and fuel the nation's pace on the path of emerging as a developed nation. He added that it would empower the women and the youth and provide many opportunities for farmers.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman promised government's efforts on nine priorities for generating ample opportunities for all, in the pursuit of 'Viksit Bharat'. The nine priorities are -- productivity and resilience in agriculture; employment and skilling; inclusive human resource development and social justice; manufacturing and services; urban development; energy security; infrastructure; innovation, research and development; and next generation reforms.

In the Interim Budget 2024, ₹6,21,541 crore lakh crore was allocated for the defence sector. The allocation was 4.72 per cent more than what it was in financial year 2023-24. Army personnel perform combat sports during the Summer Carnival 2024 at Dras in Kargil. (File)

The capital outlay has been pegged at ₹1,72,000 crore. The total allocation to the defence sector is 12.9 per cent of the total budget of the government of India for the financial year 2024-25.

In a statement on X (formally Twitter), defence minister Rajnath Singh thanked Nirmala Sitharaman for giving the “highest allocation”, which is 12.9 per cent of the total Budget for the financial year 2024-25.

""The capital outlay of ₹1,72,000 Crore will further strengthen the capabilities of Armed Forces. Earmarking of Rs, 1,05,518.43 Crore for domestic capital procurement will provide further impetus to Atmanibharta. I am pleased that Border Roads have been given 30% increase in allocation over the last budget under the capital head. This allocation of ₹6,500 Crore to BRO will further accelerate our Border Infrastructure.



“To boost the startup ecosystem in Defence Industries, ₹518 crore has been allocated to iDEX scheme to fund technological solutions given by startups, MSMEs and innovators,” Rajnath Singh posted.

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024’s botched borrowing of ideas leaves India without the impetus it needs,"The Union Budget is not merely a statement of accounts — it is a declaration of the nation’s economic priorities. By this yardstick, this budget reflects poorly on the Narendra Modi-led government and bodes ill for India’s political and economic future. Mumbai, India - July 23, 2024: A pedestrian walks past the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) building during the presentation of budget, in Mumbai, India, on Tuesday, July 23, 2024. (Photo by Anshuman Poyrekar/ Hindustan Times) (Hindustan Times)

The budget highlighted the government’s preference for politicking over nation-building. States where the National Democratic Alliance did well in the Lok Sabha Elections — Andhra Pradesh and Bihar — were massively preferred over states where the Opposition did well, e.g., Maharashtra and Haryana. Natural calamity relief flows to Bihar, Assam, Sikkim and Uttarakhand, all NDA-ruled; only Congress-ruled Himachal Pradesh is the exception. The government’s duty is to provide support to all of India based on objective criteria rather than to single out states where it is in power.

The budget speech made no mention of the Railways. At a time when there have been several tragic incidents and railway services are in shambles, this should have been top priority.

Rural India did not get its due. MGNREGA’s budget has remained stagnant at ₹86,000 crore despite huge demand for work, indicating significant unemployment and economic distress. Allocations for crop insurance and urea subsidy have been reduced. Agriculture’s share in the overall budget has declined from 4.97% in 2019-20 to 2.74% in 2024-25. Lofty commitments such as extending natural farming to 10 million farmers and using digital public infrastructure for agriculture are hardly likely to yield substantial, tangible results. The Prime Minister (PM)’s promise of doubling farmers’ incomes remains a distant dream.

A key budget priority is ‘Inclusive Human Resources Development.’ Yet welfare is glaringly neglected. The word “children” was not mentioned once. Health expenditure as a proportion of the GDP remains stagnant; the government is far from the goal of spending 2.5% of the GDP on health. Food subsidy has also been reduced.

Skilling initiatives were highlighted. However, so far, various skilling initiatives have failed to deliver. There was no mention of primary or higher education in the budget speech. Sad, given that 3.5 million children dropped out in the academic year 2021-22. Without investing in social welfare and human development, how is the government to transform future generations, another of the budget’s priorities?

The budget’s most important achievement is that it signifies the return of unemployment as a focus of the government’s policy making. Bizarrely, unemployment has been missing from the agenda for the last few years — it has rarely shown up in budget documents, the BJP’s election manifestos, or the PM’s speeches. The debacle of June 4 appears to have stirred the government to pay attention to this challenge.

Two key initiatives have been borrowed from the Congress’s Nyay Patra for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections: the internship programme, and Employment Linked Incentives. Unsurprisingly, both have been adopted rather poorly.

The Nyay Patra envisioned a Pehli Naukri Pakki scheme, which guaranteed a year-long paid apprenticeship to all college graduates and diploma holders. The budget’s internship programme, which promises to deliver internships to 10 million young people at 500 top companies over the next five years, is inspired by this idea. But it botches up the policy. Rather than make the scheme a universal guarantee for educated youth, it promises 10 million internships — simply for the gimmick value of the number. Similarly, rather than taking a comprehensive economy-wide approach, it needlessly limits itself to the top 500 companies. These top 500 companies are not the only ones who can provide quality apprenticeships — nor are they the ones actually in need of interns. Further, allowing firms to redirect Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds towards partial funding of internships will save the government some funds, but it detracts from those corporations’ other responsibilities to society. Employment Linked Incentives were also proposed in the Nyay Patra 2024, as a way for “corporates to win tax credits for additional hiring against regular, quality jobs.” The budget adopts the idea, but rather than delivering ELIs through tax credits, delivers them through reimbursements for EPFO contributions. This delivery mechanism is effectively a subsidy on wages for these employed workers. Employment-linked rebates on taxes — rather than the blanket corporate tax cuts which were announced a few years ago and failed to deliver investment or jobs — would have been a more compelling incentive for firm owners and proprietors to expand hiring.

The middle class did not get much of a respite. The budget only tinkers with and has made no major changes to the income tax slabs. This ignores the increasing inflation burden faced by the average taxpayer over the last decade. Removal of indexation is an unnecessary intervention that will hurt millions of families who invested in real estate assets over the years.

There are a few silver linings. The scrapping of the angel tax will help our start-ups. Unachievable disinvestment targets were left out. Rhetorically, MSMEs have returned to the government’s agenda.

Overall, this budget can be termed a kursi bachao budget and a Congress manifesto “copy-paste”. It shows that the Modi government has again failed to put its finger on the pulse of Indians who are hurting. It is a massive let down from a government that is running out of steam.

Education Budget 2024 Live Updates: ""Management colleges across the country exude confidence in the Union Education Budget 2024, presented by the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, emphasizing the need for innovative and access-based education. This commitment gets cemented for the future business leaders of our country due to the fact that an absolute allocation of ₹1.48 lakh crores has been made for education, employment, and skill development. The government has come forward with a scheme of providing loan assistance of up to ₹10 lakh for higher education in a domestic institution, therefore making the access to an MBA program easier and more accessible to a larger range of talent who dream of pursuing it. The most promising thing for MBA colleges is the introduction of a centrally funded scheme to train 20 lakh youth in five years in association with state governments and companies. This shall ensure that our students acquire industry-relevant skills to fill the gap between academia and professional practice. Apart from this, updating the 1,000 ITIs as per the need of the industry would further enhance the quality of management education.

The stipend amounting to ₹5,000 and a one-time allowance of ₹6,000 that the students would get under the internship scheme will provide immense hands-on experience to them. This will come along especially with encouraging companies to use their CSR funds for this initiative that would fan the creation of collaboration between MBA colleges and the corporate sector.

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: Doctors welcome decision to exempt 3 cancer drugs from customs duty,"The government on Tuesday announced to fully exempt three cancer medicines from custom duties. The government proposes to cut custom duties on these drugs from 10 per cent to nil. (Twitter/RutgersCancer)

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made the announcement while presenting the Union Budget for 2024-25 in the Lok Sabha.

Welcoming the move, doctors said this decision will help patients battling the illness.

“All imported life-saving drugs are costly, and same goes for the cancer drugs; therefore, customs duty exemption is a welcome step. And patients mostly require long term treatment, so all steps to bring the cost down are more than welcome,” said Dr Shyam Aggarwal, chairman, medical oncology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.

Political reactions on Budget 2024

The drugs that have received exemption— Trastuzumab Deruxtecan; Osimertinib; Durvalumab— are used as part of targeted cancer therapy in certain types of cancers.

Trastuzumab Deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate used primarily to treat HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). It is also being studied for use in other types of cancer, such as gastric cancer.



Osimertinib is a targeted therapy used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific mutations in the EGFR gene. It is particularly effective against cancers that have developed resistance to earlier generations of EGFR inhibitors.

Durvalumab is an immunotherapy drug that works by blocking the PD-L1 protein, helping the immune system to attack cancer cells. It is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer).

According to experts, the overall cost could come down by up to 20% due to the exemption.

Rupee comes from

“The exact reduction in cost will depend on the current customs duty rates and other associated costs such as import taxes and logistics. Exemption from basic customs duty could potentially reduce the price by 10-20%, making these treatments more affordable for patients. However, precise figures would require detailed pricing and duty structure analysis,” said Mandeep Singh Malhotra, director, surgical oncology at CK Birla Hospital.

Along with the cancer drugs, the finance minister also announced exemption of customs duty on components of X-ray tubes and digital detectors that the medical devices sector feels will encourage domestic manufacturing.

“Since there are no domestic manufacturers available for these two critical components, the relief from the government is appreciable,” said Rajiv Nath, forum coordinator, Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD).

Rupee goes to

Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, managing director and CEO, Fortis Healthcare Limited, added, “Proposing changes in the basic customs duty for X-ray tubes and flat panel detectors under the phased manufacturing programme will significantly benefit domestic OEM manufacturers by reducing costs, encouraging local sourcing, and enhancing competitiveness. This alignment will foster local manufacturing, drive technological investment, and support the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative, ultimately contributing to economic growth and job creation.”

While the health ministry received ₹90,658.63 crore, a 12.59% increase from last year and Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PMABHIM) saw an allocation of ₹3,200 crore, highlighting the government’s push for strengthening health infrastructure in the country, experts said health could have received some more attention.

“Health was not one of the nine main priorities; and the budget could have better tackled the broader challenges in healthcare with a more complete plan. By not making health one of its top nine priorities, it misses the chance to fully address the sector’s broader challenges and opportunities,” said Aashish Chaudhry, managing director, Aakash HealthCare.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2024-doctors-welcome-decision-to-exempt-3-cancer-drugs-from-customs-duty-101721731899069.html

What Economic Survey said about direct taxes?

According to Economic Survey 2023-24 released on Monday the growth in gross tax revenue (GTR) for FY24 was estimated at 13.4 per cent, resulting in a tax revenue buoyancy of 1.4. This growth was driven by a 15.8 per cent increase in direct taxes and a 10.6 per cent rise in indirect taxes compared to FY23. Direct taxes contributed approximately 55 per cent of the GTR, while indirect taxes made up the remaining 45 per cent. This increased contribution from direct taxes aligns with the government's efforts to enhance progressivity in taxation, the finance ministry document added.

Moreover, the efficiency of tax collection has improved over time, with the cost of collecting direct taxes dropping from 0.66 per cent of gross collections in FY20 to 0.51 per cent in FY23. The strong growth in both direct and indirect taxes, fueled by resilient economic activity and increased compliance, resulted in tax revenues exceeding conservative budgetary estimates.

""To give a fillip to this employment generating industry, I am proposing a simpler tax regime for foreign shipping companies operating domestic cruises in the country,"" Sitharaman said (File Photo)

Minister Sitharaman said ownership, leasing and flagging reforms will be implemented to increase the share of the Indian shipping industry and generate more employment.

""To give a fillip to this employment generating industry, I am proposing a simpler tax regime for foreign shipping companies operating domestic cruises in the country,"" she said, reported news agency PTI.

These amendments which are set to take effect from April 1, 2025, have been proposed in the budget to make India an attractive tourism destination, to attract global tourist to cruise shipping in India and to popularise cruise shipping with Indian tourists.

According to the budget document, a new taxation regime for cruise-ships business by non residents comes with a tax exemption for lease rentals, if the foreign company and the non-resident cruise ship operator have the same holding company.



It was also proposed to insert a new Section 44 BBC which would ensure that 20 per cent of the total earnings of the non-resident cruise ship operators, would be considered their profit. This would nullify the existing Section 44 B relating to presumptive taxation for shipping business of non-residents for cruise-ship business.

The amendments will accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2025-26 and subsequent assessment years, reported PTI.

According to the budget document, participation of international cruise-ship operators in this sector will encourage its development and thus create access to the best international practices.

hindustantimes.com,"Budget 2024: Standard deduction raised to Rs. 75,000 under new tax regime. How will it benefit salaried class?","While presenting the Union Budget for 2024-25 in the Lok Sabha, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an increase in the standard deduction for salaried employees from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000 under the new income tax regime for Fiscal Year 2025. Salaried taxpayers will continue to be eligible for a standard deduction of only ₹ 50,000 under the old regime (Unsplash) (Pics used for representation)

However, there has been no change in the old tax regime regarding the standard deduction. Therefore, salaried taxpayers will continue to be eligible for a standard deduction of only ₹50,000 under the old regime.

The standard deduction for family pensioners has also increased from ₹15,000 to ₹25,000. This marks the first increase in the standard deduction limit in five years, with the previous adjustment occurring in the Interim Budget of 2019, when the limit was raised to ₹50,000, effective from April 1, 2019.

The standard deduction provision had been removed for several years before being reintroduced during the Budget announcement in 2018. This benefit is available to individuals with salary or pension income, which applies only to salaried employees and pensioners.

How do you claim a standard deduction?

The standard deduction is a direct reduction applied to salary and pension income, and no documentation is needed to claim it. It is automatically applied based on the salary or pension income reported in the income tax return. Therefore, it is essential to report the receipt of salary or pension income.

What is the purpose of ‘standard deduction’?

The standard deduction is typically subtracted from the gross salary and can be claimed by all salaried employees without any investment, regardless of their category.

According to ClearTax, the introduction of the standard deduction aims to:

- Simplify tax filing by minimising paperwork and allowing deductions without requiring proof of actual expenses.

- Provide tax relief to middle-class salaried individuals.

- Extend benefits to pensioners through the standard deduction.

When was standard deduction first introduced?

The standard deduction had been available earlier but was abolished by the Finance Act of 2005.

In Budget 2018, finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced a standard deduction of ₹40,000, benefiting the salaried class by replacing the transport allowance of ₹19,200 and medical reimbursement of ₹15,000 per annum.

In the interim budget of 2019, the standard deduction was increased by ₹10,000, raising it to ₹50,000, effective from April 1, 2019.

The recent adjustment in the Budget 2024-25 raised the standard deduction to ₹75,000 under the new tax regime, benefiting salaried individuals and pensioners by reducing their taxable income and lowering their tax liability.

Family pensioners will also benefit from a higher deduction of ₹25,000.

This standard deduction is available to individuals receiving salary or pension income, but according to the TOI, it does not apply to annuity payments from insurance companies, which are taxable under ""Income from Other Sources.""",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/budget-2024-standard-deduction-raised-to-rs-75-000-under-new-tax-regime-how-will-it-benefit-salaried-class-101721731794881.html

As per data from telecom regulator TRAI, BSNL lost nearly 2.3 million subscribers, limiting its user base to just 88.06 million in March 2024. And deployment work for the 4G network has been ongoing at a much lesser pace than expected.((REUTERS))

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech proposed to allocate over ₹1 lakh crore together for both BSNL and MTNL, another state-owned entity. A majority of the funds for BSNL are set to be used for technology upgradation and restructuring of the organisation.

""The total net allocation for this demand in BE (Budget Estimate) 2024-25 is ₹1,28,915.43 crore ( ₹1,11,915.43 crore plus ₹17,000 crore). The additional provision of ₹17,000 crore is met from the balances available under Universal Service Obligation Fund and will be utilised for schemes viz., Compensation to Telecom Service Providers, Bharatnet and Research and Development,"" the budget document said.



For pension-related expenses of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) employees, including BSNL and MTNL, the budget has made a provision to allocate ₹17,510 crore with effect from April 1, 2014. To pay the principal amount of MTNL-related bonds, the government has proposed to allocate ₹3,668.97 crore.

The budget has made provision of ₹34.46 crore for Technology Development and Investment Promotion, ₹70 crore for Champion Service Sector Scheme and ₹1,806.34 crore for Production Linked Incentive Scheme.



To boost domestic manufacturing of telecom-related equipment and discourage imports, Sitharaman has proposed to increase the import duty on motherboards, also known as called Printed Circuit Boards (PCB)'s, by 5 per cent. “To incentivise domestic manufacturing, I propose to increase the BCD (Basic Customs Duty) from 10 per cent to 15 per cent on PCBA (printed circuit board assembly) of specified telecom equipment,” she added.

The import duty hike exempts PCB's that are made of critical and strategic minerals used in the manufacturing of communication equipment.

25 minerals, such as lithium, copper, cobalt, and rare earth elements, which are critical for sectors like nuclear energy, renewable energy, space, defense, telecommunications, and high-tech electronics are fully exempt from customs duties and basic custom duties (BCD) on two of them has been reduced. ""This will provide a major fillip to the processing and refining of such minerals and help secure their availability for these strategic and important sectors,"" Sitharaman said.

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: Investors welcome move to scrap controversial Angel tax on startups,"Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday announced the government's decision to scrap the controversial angel tax as part of union budget announcements. The move is expected to encourage investments into startups and spur innovation. Investments received by businesses and startups from high-net-worth individuals, beyond their fair market value, is taxed at 31%.

“To bolster the India startup ecosystem, to boost entrepreneurial spirit and support innovation, I propose abolishing angel tax for all classes of investors,” said the finance minister during her budget speech.



This move, which addresses the key demand of the startup ecosystem, follows several attempts by the community to simplify the system. The decision ""eliminates a major hurdle, making it easier and more attractive for investors to support early-stage startups,"" said Prashanth Prakash, a partner at venture capital firm Accel to Reuters.

What is Angel tax?

It is a 31 per cent tax imposed on investments by angel investors, majorly high-net-worth individuals who invest in business startups or small and medium-scale companies. Formally known as Section 56(2) (vii b) of the Income tax Act, it was imposed to tax funds raised by startups from angel investors, more than their fair market value, notes a report by Moneycontrol.

Startups have contested the methods used by the authorities to assess their fair market value and call it “impractical”. Last year the tax was extended to transactions involving foreign investors as well.

Union minister for railways and IT Ashwini Vaishnaw told PTI that the move will spur investment in startups. ""Angel tax has been a long-standing issue. Deep tech startups had a major issue on how we do valuation. That point has been addressed with its abolition,"" he said at a post-budget conference.

Move welcomed

Shaadi.com founder and Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal welcomed the move. “LTCG has also been harmonised across pvt and public cos at 12.5%. Another shot in the arm for startup investors,” Mittal posted on X (formerly twitter).

Congress leaders P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor also welcomed the move saying the party had recommended the same years ago to then finance minister Arun Jaitley.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during the post-budget Press Conference at National Media Centre, New Delhi. (PTI)

Nirmala Sitharaman said some taxpayers were reporting their rental income under the wrong income tax head, profits and gains of business or profession, thereby reducing their tax liability.

""It has been observed that some taxpayers are reporting their rental income generated by letting out of the house property, under the head ‘Profits and gains of business or profession’ in place of the head ‘Income from house property’. Accordingly, they are reducing their tax liability substantially by showing house property income under the wrong head of income,"" she said.

She proposed that the Centre would amend section 28 to clarify that any income rental income through the taxpayer's house shall not be chargeable under the ""profits and gains for business or profession"" head.



The new rule is likely to increase the tax liability of such people.

""In view of the same, it is proposed to amend section 28 of the Act to clarify that any income from letting out of a residential house or a part of the house by the owner shall not be chargeable under the head ‘Profits and gains of business or profession’ and shall be chargeable under the head 'Income from house property,"" she said.



She added that the amendment will take effect from the next financial year.

Regarding TDS (tax deducted at source) on the sale of immovable property, she clarified that ""where there is more than one transferor or transferee in respect of an immovable property, then such consideration for transfer of the immovable property shall be the aggregate of the amounts paid or payable by all the transferees to the transferor or all the transferors for transfer of such immovable property"".

Sitharaman also proposed amendments to the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, of 1988.

""It is proposed to provide immunity from penalty and prosecution to benamidar on full and true disclosure. It is also proposed to rationalize time limits for attachment of property and reference to adjudicating authority,"" she said.

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: Gold investments draw 12.5% long term capital gains tax instead of 20% with indexation,"The Union Budget 2024, presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday, reduced the Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax on gold investments from 20 per cent to 12.5 per cent. Union Budget 2024 has reduced the holding period for capital gains on gold as long term capital gains to 24 months and brought down the LTCG tax to 12.5 per cent from 20 per cent with indexation



The holding period for investing in gold as long term capital gains has been brought down from 36 months to 24 months. Further, the benefit of indexation for LTCG calculation on gold has been removed.



Under the previous rules, indexation i.e. adjustment of price for inflation was allowed while calculating long term capital gains on the sale of gold or gold jewellery.



Indexation allowed for the reduction of taxable capital gains by increasing the cost of acquisition price as per an index which tracks changes in inflation.

Before the changes made by the Union Budget, you had to own gold for 36 months before capital gains on it's sale would count as long term and would get taxed at 20 per cent.

Now, a flat rate of 12.5 per cent will be available on long term capital gains on gold sold after 24 months. The existing income tax slab rate will still be applicable to those who have short term capital gains on gold.

The new rules for capital gains on gold are applicable from July 23, 2024.

The finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, also increased tax rates for all financial and non-financial assets to 12.5 per cent from 10 per cent earlier. The tax rates on short term capital gains have also increased from 15 per cent to 20 per cent.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2024-gold-investments-draw-12-5-long-term-capital-gains-tax-instead-of-20-with-indexation-101721730620129.html
hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: Centre allocates ₹6.22 lakh crore for defence in ‘Atmanirbhar’ push,"Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday announced a defence allocation of nearly ₹6.22 lakh crore in the Union Budget 2024-25, with a sizeable chunk of the modernisation outlay allocated for buying weapons, systems and equipment from domestic suppliers in line with the NDA government’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ goal. Defence minister Rajnath Singh in Parliament on Tuesday. (ANI Photo)

The allocation is 4.79% higher than what it was in the budget estimates ( ₹5,93 lakh crore) for financial year 2023-24, but a fraction lower than last year’s revised estimates ( ₹6.23 lakh crore), budget documents show. The allocation is only ₹400 crore more than what it was in the interim budget ( ₹6,21,540.85 crore) that was announced in February, which back then accounted for 13.04% of the total government budget.

This year’s allocation ( ₹6,21,940.85 crore) includes a revenue expenditure of ₹2.82 lakh crore, a capital expenditure of ₹1.72 lakh crore and a pension outlay of ₹1.41 lakh crore. The capital outlay includes ₹1.05 lakh crore for domestic procurement, and the revenue outlay consists of ₹92,088 crore for sustenance and operational readiness.

The defence budget accounts for 12.9% of the total government budget and 1.9% of the country’s projected gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024-25.

Overall, the defence ministry has earmarked 75% of the total modernisation budget for domestic procurement in FY2024-25. “This will have a multiplier effect on the GDP, employment generation and capital formation, thus providing a stimulus to the economy,” the defence ministry said in a statement.

“The allocation is aimed to promote Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) in defence technology and manufacturing and equipping the armed forces with modern weapons/platforms along with creation of job opportunities for the youth,” the ministry said in the statement, soon after Sitharaman presented the budget in Parliament.

To be sure, she did not spell out the defence allocation in her speech.

“While maintaining the allocation made to the defence ministry during the interim budget, the government has made an additional allocation of ₹400 crore on innovation in defence through the ADITI scheme,” the ministry statement said. ADITI stands for Acing Development of Innovative Technologies with iDEX (Innovations for Defence Excellence).

The capital outlay (for modernisation) stood at ₹1.62 lakh crore in 2023-24, with the allocation revised to ₹1.57 lakh crore.

“In absolute terms, the budgetary allocation under capital head to the defence forces for FY 2024-25 is ₹1.72 lakh crore, which is 20.33% higher than the actual expenditure of FY 2022-23 and 9.40% more than the revised allocation of FY 2023-24. The allocation is aimed to fill the critical capability gaps through big ticket acquisitions in current and subsequent FYs,” the statement said. To be sure, the capital budget is 5.8% more than the budget estimates for 2023-24.

The enhanced allocation for 2024-25 will help the armed forces strengthen their capabilities with new military hardware to stay prepared for security challenges.

India is modernising its military with fighter jets, helicopters, warships, tanks, artillery guns, rockets and missiles, unmanned capabilities and other combat systems at a time when it is locked in a military standoff with China in eastern Ladakh.

The standoff has entered its fifth year, with no indication of an immediate resolution to the outstanding problems along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), even as India is hoping that ongoing negotiations with the neighbour will result in restoring the status quo ante of April 2020.

“The enhanced budgetary allocation will fulfill the requirement of annual cash outgo on planned capital acquisitions aimed at equipping the armed forces with state-of-the-art niche technology, lethal weapons, fighter aircraft, ships, submarines, unmanned aerial vehicles, and specialist vehicles,” the statement said.

The revenue expenditure includes almost ₹6,000 crore for the Agnipath scheme, up from ₹4.266 crore and ₹3,518 crore in the budget and revised estimates for 2023-24.

Revised estimates in the budget documents show that the armed forces were unable to spend ₹5,372 crore of last year’s capital outlay of ₹1.62 lakh crore. In 2022-23, the armed forces spent around ₹21,000 crore on top of the previous year’s budget allocation, as border tensions with China saw the country make a raft of emergency purchases and sharpen its focus on building infrastructure in forward areas.

The Border Roads Organisation, which is at the centre of India’s border infrastructure push, has been given a capital outlay of ₹6,500 crore, which is 30% higher than the allocation for FY 2023-24 and 160% higher than that in FY 2021-22.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2024-centre-allocates-6-22-lakh-crore-for-defence-in-atmanirbhar-push-101721737362053.html
hindustantimes.com,Union Budget 2024 promises a paid internship scheme for the youth: What is it all about?,"Nirmala Sitharaman took the floor of the Lok Sabha today, July 23 in what was her record-breaking 7th budget address. The Union Budget 2024-25 had several highlights ranging from a reduced fiscal deficit target to a revised income tax structure, among other key points. Most relevant for the youth however, has been the paid internship scheme which ensures a renewed wave of opportunities for them. Let's decode what all it has to offer. Nirmala Sitharaman pictured at the Lok Sabha on July 23, with the Union Budget

The basics

The paid internship scheme aims to target 1 crore youth over the next 5 years, by providing them with government-mandated internship opportunities across the country's top 500 companies. A monthly stipend of ₹5,000 in tow with a one-time assistance sum of ₹6,000 will be ensured for every intern. The companies participating in this initiative will be undertaking the cost of training the interns on-board, partially funded via their CSR budget.

Top 500 companies: What kind of exposure can the youth expect?

An assured chance to work across the country's top-ranking companies presents itself as a rather enticing opportunity. The possibility of a spot, experiencing the hustle-bustle and inner workings of India's “top 500 companies” makes it possible for the youth to eye having names like Reliance Industries, TCS, HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank, State Bank of India and Infosys, Life Insurance, Hindustan Unilever and ITC on their CVs.

How is this scheme being funded?

The government will be allocating a sizeable fun of ₹1.48 lakh crores, geared at enhancing education, employment and skill, aiming to eventually create 4.1 crore jobs. As mentioned earlier, the CSR budget for the participating companies will also be funding this paid internship scheme. As per Section 135 of the Companies Act 2013, companies which fulfill certain criteria when it comes to their net worth, turnover and profit, are expected to allocate 2 percent of their average net profit over the past 3 years in pursuing their corporate social responsibility goals.

What does this promise the youth?

The opportunity to work in a thorough professional environment will go a long way in sharpening the youth's hard skills as well as soft skills as they gear up to officially enter the workforce. The long term goal of this scheme is to boost employment, not just figuratively but in an effective manner.

What does the youth have to say?

With unpaid internships often being equated with free labour, a specified stipend, packages the opportunity as more lucrative for those aspiring to build strongly-grounded careers. Having the government's assurance in this respect, also ensures that the cumulative takeaway from the experience actually contributes to the youth's professional graph instead of just being a time-killing placeholder. Amity University BBA student, Adina Basu, 20, currently interning at ITC, says, ""For me personally it sounds promising since more than half of the internships are so unstructured and haphazard. The companies usually help in absolutely nothing and after all the work that you put in, to not be acknowledged in any way, ends up making us feel defeated. So hopefully the new scheme should give internships some sort of structure"".

In the same breath, Preet Shyamsukha, 21, has his reservations about how effective the scheme will pan out to be. He says, ""In the broader picture it will be beneficial only if red tape bureaucracy doesn't take place and the interns are converted into salaried individuals"". Diya Paul, 20, currently interning at Maxview Now, highlights how the initiative is a positive step towards bridging the gap between theoretical education and practical hands-on experience. She says, ""This initiative is a powerful step towards nurturing young talent, bridging the gap between education and employment, and unlocking the true potential of the youth"".

Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh also slammed the Modi government, saying,""After ten years of denial - where neither the non-biological PM nor his party's Lok Sabha Elections Manifesto would even mention jobs - the Union Government seems to have finally come around to tacitly admitting that mass unemployment is a national crisis that requires urgent attention.""





“It's far too late, and as it turns out, far too little - the Budget speech is more focused on posturing than action,” he added in a series of X posts.

“There are many things missing. There was no mention of MNREGA. There was no mention of any serious measures to improve the income of the bottom 40 per cent of our population whose income have gone down. There was very little addressing of inequality in our country today,” Congress MP Shashi Tharoor told PTI.







Congress MP Manickam Tagore said,""This Budget has more or less copied the Congress manifesto... The important thing is about the Yuva Nidhi scheme...

hindustantimes.com,Union Budget 2024: 6 new changes to income tax that the new budget may bring,"As the Union Budget 2024 is scheduled to be presented on July 23 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, there are expectations of multiple changes in income tax, including changes in tax slabs, a potential hike for standard deduction, and increased exemptions. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at Parliament, during the ongoing Budget Session, in New Delhi. (PTI)

Will there be changes in the income tax slabs?

What are the current tax rates for the new tax regime?

The current slabs for the new tax regime are as follows:

Up to ₹3 lakh: NIL

₹3-6 lakh: 5% on income which exceeds ₹3 lakh

₹6-9 lakh: ₹15,000 + 10% on income more than ₹6 lakh

₹9-12 lakh: ₹45,000 + 15% on income more than ₹9 lakh

₹12-15 lakh: ₹90,000 + 20% on income more than ₹12 lakh

Above ₹15 lakh: ₹1.5 lakh + 30% on income more than ₹15 lakh

Will the government increase the income tax exemption limit?

The government may increase the income tax exemption limit, or the 0% tax slab from ₹3 lakh currently to ₹5 lakh, according to multiple reports.



If it happens, this could mean that individuals with an annual income up to ₹8.5 lakh could potentially not have to pay any income tax, considering the standard deduction and the rebate under section 87A.

Will the government reduce income tax rates?

""Despite the changes introduced in Budget 2023 to incentivize taxpayers to switch to the new tax regime, the adoption rate has not met expectations,"" a Mint report quoted Divya Baweja, Partner at Deloitte India as saying.



""The government is anticipated to consider lowering the top tax rate from 30% to 25% within the new tax regime,"" the report quoted her as saying, and adding that “There is also speculation that the government might raise the threshold for the highest tax rate from ₹10 lakh to ₹20 lakh under the old tax regime.”

What changes will the Union Budget 2024 bring to standard deduction?

The 2018 budget saw the introduction of standard deduction at ₹40,000. This was raised to ₹50,000 in 2019, and has remained unchanged since.



The Union Budget 2024 may see an increase in standard deduction to somewhere between ₹60,000 to ₹1 lakh. This would lower the taxable income of salaried employees.

What changes will Section 80C exemptions see in the Union Budget 2024?

Salaried employees can see their income which has to be taxed, reduce by ₹1.5 lakh by using Section 80C exemptions, which has remained unchanged since 2014, despite growing inflation.

A revision can help taxpayers to manage inflation, increase savings, and invest more, according to the report.

What change can potentially come to the National Pension System (NPS) in the Union Budget 2024?

The National Pension System (NPS) may raise additional income tax deducion limit under Section 80CCD 1B, and may increase the withdrawal limit at maturity, bringing it in line with other schemes like EPF.

Will House Rent Allowance (HRA) see changes in the Union Budget 2024?

House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemptions have to be increased due to heightening rental expenses in urban areas, the report quoted Abhishek Jain, a partner at Kailash Chand Jain & Co as saying.

If HRA exemptions are increased, it would lower the taxable income and help individuals more easily afford rented properties.

Will there be an increase in medical insurance premium deductions in the Union Budget 2024?

There may be an increase in the deduction limit for medical insurance premiums under section 80D of the Income Tax Act of 1961 due to increasing healthcare costs. The current limit is ₹25,000 for individuals and ₹50,000 for senior citizens.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/union-budget-2024-6-new-changes-to-income-tax-that-the-new-budget-may-bring-101721623489188.html

hindustantimes.com,Financial Budget 2024: Will Nirmala Sitharaman bring relief to taxpayers?,"Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday will table her seventh straight Union Budget in Lok Sabha. The first budget in Narendra Modi government's third term is being keenly watched by all in this 140-crore strong democracy.







The taxpayers have enormous expectations from Sitharaman, who in her first stint in the finance ministry led India through difficult times during the Covid-19 pandemic. The expectations include changes in tax slabs, a potential hike in standard deductions, and more exemptions.



Union Budget 2024: Full Coverage



The upcoming budget could witness big-ticket announcements in key sectors such as health, infrastructure, education, defence, real estate and others. The budget is expected to lay a roadmap for Viksit Bharat (developed India) by 2047, as envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while giving a glimpse of 10 years' performance.



Sitharaman had in her first Budget in 2019 replaced the leather briefcase - which had been in use for decades for carrying Budget documents -- with a traditional 'bahi-khata' wrapped in red cloth.



“This budget is an important budget of Amrit Kaal. We have got an opportunity of five years and this budget will determine the direction of our work for those five years and also lay a strong foundation for fulfilling our dream of a 'Viksit Bharat' in 2047, when we will celebrate 100 years of independence,” the prime minister had said ahead of the commencement of the second leg of the budget session of parliament.





What Economic Survey said

Ahead of the Union budget, Nirmala Sitharaman presented the economic survey before Parliament. The report has set a growth forecast of 6.5 to 7 per cent for the current financial year. The survey also flagged the need to create more jobs in the economy.

The growth forecast is lower than the 8.2 per cent growth seen in the previous 2023-24 (April 2023 to March 2024) fiscal and below RBI's 7.2 per cent estimate for the current fiscal.



""The Indian economy is on a strong wicket and stable footing, demonstrating resilience in the face of geopolitical challenges,"" Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran wrote in the preface of the annual financial document.





How stock market fared on economic survey?

The stock market closed lower with the Sensex dropping 102 points to settle at 80,502.08. It had fallen by 504 points or 0.62 per cent to hit an intra-day low of 80,100.65 but recovered most of the losses as Infosys and HDFC Bank advanced.



Nifty of the NSE dipped 21.65 points or 0.09 per cent to 24,509.25. During the day, it dropped 168.6 points or 0.68 per cent to 24,362.30.

Sachin Kothari, Director Of Augmont - Gold For All said, ""Changes in import duty are the top priority. The market expects an Import duty cut in Gold from 15% to 10% and for Silver import duty to be at par with Gold under CEPA. Some refineries in India have been importing unrefined gold (gold dore) from LDCs under zero duty, so stopping Import Duty benefits from LDC and FTA countries is expected as it distorts a level playing field.

With IIBX at GIFT city emerging as a gateway to import bullion, bullion players want all import and export of gold to happen through IIBX. A special benefit of 0.5% should be given for importing gold. Market participants also like the setting of a Jewellery Export Center at GIFT City for domestic smaller traders.

Since the Gems and Jewellery market is regulated by SEBI, RBI, DGFT, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce, etc, market players want a single regulator in this market and also 100% bullion trade to be moved through Commodity Exchanges.

Sovereign Gold Bond has become very popular in India and gaining a lot of attraction. However, The interest earned from Sovereign Gold Bonds is subject to taxation as per the regulations, if redeemed before eight years. Market participants want the interest income on SGB to be made tax-free, to attract more investors in this scheme.

Other expectations are the establishment of GST bonded warehouses, mandatory hallmarking across India for all jewellers, permitting EMI on jewellery purchases and allowing lending and borrowing through commodity exchanges.""",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-live-updates-will-sitharaman-bring-changes-in-tax-slabs-101721612531154.html

A man walks out of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) building in Mumbai, India, February 28, 2020. (Hemanshi Kamani/Reuters)

An important component is capital gains tax, and any changes in this can lead to significant implications for the market.

What is capital gains tax?

Capital gains tax is a tax levied on profits made out of the sale of capital assets such as land, building, vehicles, patents, jewellery, and so on. Shares also come under this definition.



That is the reason why markets could see a potential rally if the government decides to reduce capital gains tax and vice versa.

What do experts say on the matter of capital gains tax in the Union Budget 2024?

Chris Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies wrote in his weekly note called GREED & Fear that the government is likely to increase the capital gains tax.



""The reason that such proposals are apparently under consideration is growing evidence of retail speculation, most particularly in the options market where India has options for individual stocks. Such paper speculation is unlikely to be viewed as healthy by Modi, or indeed the BJP. GREED & fear’s probably correct assumption is that the Indian Prime Minister has a natural suspicion of those making money out of money, most particularly in a zero-sum game like options,"" he wrote.

However, he also believes the government is less likely to increase the tax significantly because of the fact that it is now a coalition, but a big market correction is likely to occur if the tax is increased substantially.



However, a simplified capital gains tax structure in terms of rates and computation methods is expected out of the Union Budget 2024, according to a nte by EY, which also recommended at least a 10% consideration for normative taxation purposes for transferring unlisted shares.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/union-budget-2024-how-will-the-stock-market-react-to-capital-gains-tax-changes-in-the-budget-101721620749204.html

hindustantimes.com,Union Budget 2024: These mutual fund investors will benefit if Section 80C limit is increased,"As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, expectations are that there may be multiple changes to income tax. A change in the Section 80C limit of the Income Tax Act can however, benefit Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman (PTI)

What are Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds?

Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds are tax-saving mutual funds that use the tax deduction provisions under Section 80C to save tax expenses on equity share investments.

They have a 3-year lock-in period, due to which, only long term capital gains tax can be levied upon them.



However, ELSS funds are currently the only mutual funds also eligible for tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act of 1961, with claim deductions up to ₹1.5 lakh possible.

Up to ₹1.5 lakh annually can be tax-free, with any amount above this being levied upon, a 10% long-term capital gains tax. This ₹1.5 lakh limit was established in 2014 by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.

What are the Section 80C limits?

Section 80C of the Income Tax Act 1 makes it possible for some specified expenditures and investments to become exempt from income tax.



What are the expert opinions on Section 80C limits?

An adjustment in the Section 80C limit would assist taxpayers in managing the impact of inflation, increase their savings, and enable investments in essential financial instruments like ELSS, tax saver FDs, and PPF, a Mint report quoted Archit Gupta, CEO of Clear as saying.

It would redirect more capital into critical sectors such as insurance, PF, and ESOPs, Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director of Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited told Mint.



“Increasing the LTCG limit for deduction from ₹1 lakh to ₹3 lakh would provide significant relief,"" Mint quoted Preeti Zende, a Sebi-registered investment advisor and founder of Apna Dhan Financial Services.

It said, “As such, unless budget grossly disappoints by hiking capital gains tax rate or surprises on bold reforms, we think the narrative of the market will be decided by the earnings growth hereon.” Stock market: A bird flies past a screen displaying the Sensex results on the facade of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) building in Mumbai.(Reuters)

In order to lift the mood of the market, the Budget will have to focus on three themes: fiscal consolidation, consumption boost and capex spending.

Elara said, “Commitment to fiscal glide path through FY26 could be credit rating positive. Given the rate cut cycle is also around the corner, rate-sensitive sectors, such as autos, banks, IT and pharma, are set to benefit.”

It added, “Measures to bolster rural income, wages and consumption would initially drive-up sales for retail and small-ticket white good companies with follow-on impact on FMCG in the later stage.”

On capital expenditure, the brokerage said, “Markets are likely to respond favorably to targeted spending that drives growth in these critical sectors. While we continue to like aerospace & defense and capital goods, significant froth and high valuation suggest limited upside.”

Anuj Bajpai, Co-founder and CEO, Liquide warned that there could be volatility in the stock market owing to which investors should remain vigilant for the typical market pattern of “buy on rumours, sell on news.”

He advised, “Prioritize investments in sectors poised to gain from the budget. Consider stocks like M&M, L&T, Ultratech Cement, Chambal Fertilisers, Ircon, BEL, Reliance Industries, PFC, NTPC, Dabur, HUL, and Aavas Financiers. Additionally, park funds into defensive sectors like FMCG, Healthcare, and Utilities, which typically maintain steady performance through different economic cycles.”",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/confused-where-to-invest-stock-market-may-like-budget-2024-if-nirmala-sitharaman-focuses-on-these-themes-101721303693772.html
hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: Will Nirmala Sitharaman bring cheer to middle-class with income tax changes?,"The Union Budget 2024 could provide Income Tax relief for low earners looms large amid rising prices in the country. Experts believe that a reduction in Income Tax could address economic challenges in the country as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 on July 23. Budget 2024: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is seen.

Rohan Bhargava, co-founder, CashKaro and EarnKaro, told Hindustan Times, “We are closely watching the discussions around income tax reforms in the upcoming budget. The current tax rate for earnings above ₹15 lakh stands at 30%, which is quite steep. The significant jump in tax rates from ₹3 lakh to ₹15 lakh highlights the need for a more gradual increase. Raising the income threshold before any tax is levied from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh would provide individuals, especially those in the lower earning bracket, with more disposable income. This change would boost consumption, increase savings for the middle class, and provide positive momentum for the e-commerce industry.”

Reports claimed that the Union Budget could prioritise tax cuts for low earners over traditional welfare spending initiatives to enhance disposable incomes and in order to ensure increased consumer spending to stimulate broader economic activity. In the current tax system, Income Tax rates start at 5% for earnings over ₹3 lakh and escalate sharply to 30% for incomes exceeding ₹15 lakh.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/budget-2024-will-nirmala-sitharaman-bring-cheer-to-middle-class-with-income-tax-changes-101721295480965.html

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Hitesh Avhad, Managing Director, Avhad Group, said, ''The real estate sector serves as both a major catalyst for economic growth and a vital provider of employment in India. As we look towards the Union Budget 2024-25, there is an urgent need for the sector to be granted industry status, which would facilitate access to lower-cost financing and tax benefits. High taxes on essential materials such as cement and steel, particularly the 28% GST on cement, are inflating project costs and must be addressed to sustain growth.

Implementing a single-window clearance system would significantly streamline approval processes, accelerating project timelines and reducing costs. Additionally, enhancing tax benefits for homebuyers by raising the deduction limit for home loan interest payments and providing income tax relief on second homes would spur demand and make homeownership more attainable.""",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-live-updates-what-salaried-taxpayers-expect-from-nirmala-sitharaman-101721183823582.html

Stakeholders of the emerging co-working and co-living segments have demanded inclusion in smart city planning, indirect tax rationalization and integration with special economic zones, among others. Co-working and co-living players demand tax cuts, integration with SEZs in Union Budget 2024 (Representational photo)(Unsplash)

The flexible office space segment has demonstrated a consistent upward trajectory following the Covid-19 pandemic, gaining increasing market share within the larger commercial real estate sector. Large enterprises too have shifted gears in favour of this category amid adoption of a hybrid work culture. Meanwhile, the organised co-living segment, albeit at a nascent stage, is giving the rental housing market a run for its money.

What are flexible office providers seeking from Budget 2024?

Stakeholders across the segment stated that lowering the Goods and Services Tax rate for small-scale co-working clients would make the segment more accessible to startups and small businesses, expand the industry's reach, and ultimately bring in revenue.

“This reduction can act as a catalyst for the expansion of co-working spaces across tier II and tier III cities, whilst fostering entrepreneurship and innovation in these regions, which is the need of the hour,” said Suvrat Jain, founder and CEO of Onward workspaces.



“We expect the budget would enable co-working firms to claim input credit on work contract and construction services supplied so that it is passed on to companies who lease out space for co-working and thereby reduce their overall costs,” said Manas Mehrotra, founder, 315Work Avenue, adding lower/concessional rate of TDS will also improve working capital of co-working firms.

Furthermore, there has been an increasing demand to reduce the tax rates applicable for co-working spaces too as a majority of the receivables from their clients are towards services. “The expectation is to bring co-working spaces into the 2% TDS slab, as in the case of services, from the present 10%,” said Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO - India, South-East Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE.

Integrate co-working spaces with SEZs

Many across the real estate sector see a major opportunity in integrating co-working spaces with special economic zones (SEZs). “This would create a win-win scenario, combining the co-working sector's agility and focus on innovation with the SEZs' beneficial regulations for businesses,” said Sumit Lakhani, Deputy CEO, Awfis Space Solutions.

He added that the move could attract a wave of domestic and international companies, fuelling economic growth and fostering dynamic business hubs in India’s tier II cities.



According to a report by property consultancy Colliers, India’s flexible office space stock is expected to reach 80 million square feet (msf) by 2026 to account for 9-10% of the total Grade A office stock of the country.

In the April-June period of 2024, the segment accounted for a 14.6% share in the overall office leasing activity recorded across the top-7 markets in India, per JLL.

This is what the co-living segment expects from Budget 2024

Nikhil Sikri, co-founder and CEO of Zolostays, made a case for greater formalization of this sector, bringing both organized and unorganized players under the ambit of GST, direct taxes and comprehensive regulations.

“At present, only organized entities are subjected to these laws, resulting in significant cost disparities and diminishing the competitive intensity for compliant businesses,” he protested.



Other items on the list, in line with the larger real estate sector’s demands, include a single-window clearance for regulatory approvals, financial incentives and green credits for eco-friendly buildings and easier access to funding, among others.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/budget-2024-wish-list-tax-cuts-integration-with-sezs-among-top-demands-of-co-working-and-co-living-players-101721215732407.html

As such, there might not be any major changes to it in the pipeline. However, we can expect announcements that enhance EoDB and consolidate the tax system while ensuring stability. I also hope there will be some progress towards the Direct Tax Code. The implementation of GST has reformed the indirect taxation system, and we can expect the Direct Tax Code to lower the tax burden and simplify the tax structure similarly. The Government can enhance the limits for each slab in the new tax regime in the upcoming budget to reduce tax liabilities for the middle class. Increasing the rebate limit in the 2024 budget will be a logical choice in getting taxpayers to switch to the new regime. These changes enhance disposable income and significantly boost their spending power.”",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-live-updates-will-nirmala-sitharaman-provide-income-tax-relief-101721097871274.html

When is the 8th Pay Commission due?

Central Pay Commissions are usually constituted every ten years to review and recommend revisions to salaries, allowances as well as benefits for central government employees by factoring in variables like inflation.

The Seventh Pay Commission was formed by Manmohan Singh on February 28, 2014 and it submitted its report on November 19, 2015. Recommendations came into effect on January 1, 2016.

If the pattern of ten years is followed, the 8th Pay Commission should be implemented from January 1, 2026 but no official announcement has been made so far on this.

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman with union minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary during the 'halwa' ceremony.

The ceremony is organised in the basement of North Block, which houses the ministry in the national capital and is attended by the finance minister and other high-ranking officials.

""The final stage of the Budget preparation process for Union Budget 2024-25 commenced with the customary Halwa ceremony in the presence of Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. @nsitharaman, in New Delhi, today,"" the finance ministry said in a post on X.

What is ‘halwa’ ceremony?

The ceremony is a kind of a 'send-off' for finance ministry officials and staff involved in the preparation of the Budget. Officials enter what is called a 'lock-in' period, during which they stay in the basement of North Block to maintain secrecy around the final budget document.

The officials only emerge after the finance minister completes her Budget speech in the Lok Sabha. The basement of North Block houses a printing press that was traditionally used to print budget documents for 40 years from 1980 to 2020 after which the budget went digital.

hindustantimes.com,"Union Budget 2024: Focus on citizen welfare and manufacturing, says former World Bank chief economist","As the Union Budget 2024 is scheduled to be presented next week on July 23, the government must focus on the welfare of ordinary citizens and allocate more funds for the manufacturing sector to boost small businesses and create more jobs, Kaushik Basu said in an interview with PTI. Kaushik Basu, former chief economic adviser to the PM as well as former World Bank chief economist

Who is Kaushik Basu?

Kaushik Basu was the chief economist of the World Bank from 2012 to 2016 and served as the chief economic adviser to the Indian government from 2009 to 2012. He is currently the C. Marks Professor of International Studies and Professor of Economics at Cornell University.

What does Kaushik Basu say on India's GDP growth and inflation?

Basu said that though India's overall GDP growth over the last two years has been good, focusing so much on GDP leads to two major ground-level challenges India is facing, which includes steeply rising inequality and high unemployment. India's youth unemployment is among the highest in the world, he added.



The inflation faced by poor families is much greater than the national average of 5.08 per cent and the inflation that rich households face, he said.

What does Kaushik Basu feel about the new coalition government?

The RBI's inflation target is 4%, with a margin of 2% on either side.

The Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) crossed the halfway mark in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections with support from N Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar-led JD(U), and other alliance partners.



Basu said that while single-party, majority-run governments are typically more effective in making policy, a coalition government which doesn't just focus on increasing GDP numbers is better for the country.

What does Kaushik Basu say on unemployment and youth unemployment?

In 2022, unemployed youths accounted for nearly 83% of India's total unemployed population, according to an International Labour Organization (ILO) report.

All political parties have a self-interest in high youth unemployment since this is their source of cheap labour from political volunteers, he said, expressing hope that the parties would rise above their own interest and implement policies in the interest of the nation, which is job creation.



He also felt that though unemployment is a global issue due to technological advancements leading to declining demand for labour, India where labour is cheap can still increase its demand for it, just like countries such as Vietnam that do it successfully.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/union-budget-2024-focus-on-citizen-welfare-and-manufacturing-says-former-world-bank-chief-economist-101721118851055.html

HT couldn’t independently verify the information. Gig workers wait in line to collect their delivery order outside a mall in Mumbai. (Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters)

Who are gig workers?

Gig workers include temporary workers, people who work for online platforms like Swiggy or Ola, and independent contract workers in the construction sector, for examples.

Workers, aggregators and the government shall contribute to this fund and institutions like the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) may also be part of it to provide medical facilities to gig workers, the report read.



The government has also made a proposal to include these facilities in the Social Security Code 2020, according to the report, which states that this comes at a time when the National Human Rights Commission reached out to the Ministry of Labour and Employment regarding reports of tough working conditions at Amazon’s Haryana warehouse.

What were the problems at Amazon’s Haryana warehouse?

Lack of restrooms, long working hours without toilet or water breaks, and ten-hour shifts for a ₹10,000 salary were some of the issues at Amazon’s Haryana warehouse.



Amazon responded, stating that this was an 'isolated' incident and blamed the supervisor for it. However, the All India Gig Workers union led a country-wide protest in November 2023 due to 10-hour work schedules.

Is Karnataka a step ahead for gig worker welfare?

This also comes after Congress general secretary, in-charge communications, Jairam Ramesh said that India requires a nationwide legal and social security architecture for gig workers and hoped that the Union Budget 2024 will do something about it, according to an Economic Times report.

""As much as state governments can do, India needs a national legal and social security architecture for gig workers. Their numbers are only projected to rise, from 77 lakhs in 2022 to about 2.4 crores in 2030. The ball is in the court of the Union Government. Hopefully the forthcoming Budget will take a step in this direction,"" he said.

hindustantimes.com,Union Budget 2024: Overseas credit card spending above ₹7 lakh may be taxed 20%,"The Union Budget 2024, which is scheduled to be presented on July 23 may bring overseas credit card spending above ₹7 lakh under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), which means that the government would be able to collect a 20% tax on it, Moneycontrol reported, citing an unnamed government official. This is also to discourage outflow of money and may be part of an amendment to the Income Tax Act. India saw $31.73 billion worth of outflows under LRS in the financial year 2023-24.

What is the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS)?

The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) LRS scheme allows an Indian resident to transfer up to $250,000 outside India in a financial year.



Expenses paid internationally using debit cards, forex cards, or other payment methods incur a 20% tax collected at source (TCS) once they go over ₹7 lakh per person per financial year.

However, credit card transactions were exempt from being taxed under LRS rules. This was because debit cards were directly linked to bank accounts unlike credit cards. This exemption was also for giving time to banks for establishing infrastructure to monitor international credit card transactions.



The tax for education and health expenditures abroad is only expected to be taxed at a fixed 5% rate, even for amounts exceeding ₹7 lakh.

How much outflow of funds does India see?

India saw $31.73 billion worth of outflows under LRS in the financial year 2023-24, which was nearly a 17% rise from the previous year, according to RBI data.

The Interim Budget 2024 presented on February 1 this year, did not include provisions to tax international credit card transactions under the Tax Collected at Source (TCS) framework.

The Union Budget 2023 raised the TCS rate on foreign remittances from 5% to 20%, with some exceptions, with the revised rates becoming operational from July 1, 2023, according to a Business Today report.

What does the EV industry want from the Union Budget 2024?

The industry expects the introduction of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India (FAME) - III, funds for public charging infrastructure, incentives for localising components, and reduction of GST on EVs, among others.



“The industry hopes the FAME scheme will expand to include private buses and commercial vehicles (CVs), which have so far been limited to State Transport Undertakings (STUs),"" Aryaman Tandon, Managing Partner at Praxis Global Alliance for the Mobility sector told ANI. ""Reducing customs duties on imported EV components and supporting local R&D in battery technology, as seen in the last budget, will further accelerate local manufacturing and create jobs.”

EV adoption increased by 48% in 2023 primarily due to government subsidies like FAME-II, ANI quoted Nimish Trivedi, the founder & CEO of Evera, as saying.



The FAME Scheme, initially introduced in 2015, promotes electric and hybrid vehicle adoption in India and has completed two terms; FAME-I and FAME-II.

“We expect the government to consider reducing GST rates on EV components and batteries from the current 18 percent to 5 percent,” Mukesh Taneja, CEO and Co-Founder at GT FORCE told ANI. ""This tax rationalisation would help offset potential price increases resulting from the conclusion of subsidy programmes and keep EVs affordable for the masses.""

Why does India's EV industry want all these new reforms?

All this comes at a time when global electric vehicle sales have been slowing down. India is no exception.

India’s EV two-wheeler market has saw registrations falling by 27% in May compared to the previous year, according to a Mint report.



This led Ola Electric founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal to write a post on X (Formerly Twitter) advising EV companies to invest more on the product and its supply chain and lesser on its marketing, or what he called as “cute” ads.

In April 2020, the government consolidated 10 PSBs into four, reducing the total number of PSBs to 12 from 27 in March 2017. (Reuters)

What are the bank laws that may be amended?

Amendments in other acts such as the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970, and the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1980 may also happen because amendments are needed to increase privatisation, as these are the same laws that led to nationalisation in the past.



The government had earlier proposed amendments to these laws for the 2021 winter session, with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announcing the privatisation of public sector banks while presenting the Union Budget 2021, but these could not go through.

""Other than IDBI Bank, we propose to take up the privatisation of two PSBs and one general insurance company in 2021-22,"" she said.

In April 2020, the government consolidated 10 PSBs into four, reducing the total number of PSBs to 12 from 27 in March 2017.

What were some of India's bank mergers of the past?

The United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce were merged with Punjab National Bank, making the new entity, India's second-largest PSB.



Syndicate Bank was merged with Canara Bank, Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank, and Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank were merged with the Union Bank of India.

Bank of Baroda merged Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with itself in 2019.

SBI merged five of its associate banks, including State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Hyderabad, and also Bharatiya Mahila Bank. This was in April 2017.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman address a meeting with economists ahead of the Union budget which will be presented on July 23, in New Delhi on Thursday. (ANI)

The conversation, ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25, was largely about accelerating efforts to rapidly alleviate poverty by keeping inflation under check, deepening and broadening welfare measures, and creating employment opportunities through investments and skilling, the people said, asking not to be named.

In a social media post on X, the Prime Minister confirmed the development. “Earlier today, interacted with eminent economists and heard their insightful views on issues pertaining to furthering growth,” he said.



The meeting, held at Niti Aayog, is crucial as the government is likely to present the Modi government’s vision for the next five years in the budget.

Speaking in the Rajya Sabha, Modi on July 3 stressed that the government will accelerate and expand the pace of reforms undertaken in the last 10 years and those efforts would witness newer heights and depth in terms of saturation in delivery of basic services.

The meeting on Thursday was attended Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, sectoral experts, economists, and senior officials. Sitharaman is scheduled to present the budget for FY25 in the Parliament on July 23.

Niti Aayog vice chairman Suman Bery was a part of the meeting, as were planning minister Rao Inderjit Singh, chief economic advisor V Anantha Nageswaran, economists Ashok Gulati and Surjit Bhalla, and banker KV Kamath.



“This budget will be the first document providing a road map transform India into a $30 trillion developed economy by 2047 for projected 165 billion citizens,” one of the people aware of the details said. “It will provide a template for a future-ready India.” The identified focus areas are rural development, agricultural growth, investments in infrastructure, health, housing, sanitation, education, skilling, security and trade, he added.

The PM will take inputs of experts and economists for accelerating economic growth and social reforms, a second person said. “The idea is to make lives of citizens easy and prosperous,” he added. The suggestions centered around further consolidating the fiscal position, continuing public expenditure to boost growth, giving impetus to ease of living, and focussing on farmers, women, youth, middle-classes, and the vulnerable, he said.

Economic development to tackle hunger and poverty eradication was also proposed in the meeting, a third peson said.

Clearly, the Budget 2024 will be an acid test for the Modi Government.

Meanwhile, expectations are rife with regard to the likely changes and alternatives to be brought in by the new budget. Experts across academic circles aired their views and opinions to Hindustan Times Digital.

Need for GST exemption

Prateek Maheshwari, the Co-Founder of PW and Chair of the India EdTech Consortium (IEC), said that students hailing from Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Low-Income Groups should receive 100 percent GST exemption from all educational expenses, be it test-prep or job-oriented skill courses. He pointed out, “The 18 percent tax slab is extremely high for a need as basic as education. The government should derive a mechanism to enable more students in receiving quality education, and at the same time, make it affordable.”



“We welcome the GST exemption related to student housing, however, it is important to remove the ambiguities. It continues to be a grey area, given the student needs to continuously reside in that accommodation for a period of 90 days. While the aim is to benefit the students, this exemption lacks clarity on execution in terms of timeline,” said Maheshwari.

Prioritising teacher training and digital infrastructure

Prajodh Rajan, the Co-Founder & Group CEO of Lighthouse Learning (formerly EuroKids International), said that a significant boost in education spending is crucial to unlock India's true potential. Emphasizing a multi-faceted strategy, Rajan said, “We need to prioritize teacher training and development programmes as well as strengthen digital infrastructure to facilitate seamless learning experiences. Investing in upskilling our educators with the latest pedagogies and technologies is crucial for delivering high-quality education.”

He also underlined the importance of improving early childhood education infrastructure, which includes establishing more high-quality preschools, particularly in underserved communities. “Early education lays the foundation for lifelong learning, and ensuring accessibility for all is vital. A forward-thinking budget that prioritizes education will empower our youth, drive economic growth, and foster social progress. We are optimistic that the government will recognize these imperatives and create an environment where every student can thrive,” Rajan added.



Introducing student-friendly education loans

Shweta Sastri, the Managing Director of Canadian International School, Bangalore, stressed that a substantial portion of the student community depends on educational loans to pursue their dream course. She said, “Encouraging more students to take up their course of interest with lower interest rates on such loans is essential for their optimal growth and development.”

She pointed out that the government should announce measures to further promote the integration of technology in education and to build future-ready skills in students which

Besides, improving internet connectivity infrastructure across the nation that promotes last-mile access was a point put forth by Sastri. She said, “Looking ahead, we must strive to ensure that the learning experience remains meaningful and enriching. It is important to nurture, challenge, and empower all students to be successful in whatever they choose in life.”

Expanding access to education and technology in underserved areas

Niru Agarwal, the Trustee of Greenwood High International School said that the upcoming budget should address core aspects of education to enhance the quality of learning, improve teacher professional skills, and build robust infrastructure. “While new educational policies have identified many path-breaking initiatives, we urge the government to focus on expanding access to education and technology, particularly in rural and underserved areas. We must build the right combination of Digital, Physical, and on-the-job classroom infrastructure that will improve the efficacy of learning,” Agarwal said.

She added, “Increasing women’s participation in STEM fields is also crucial, and at the same time, we must create an enabling environment to let the private sector come forward and establish new institutions. Ease of doing business is more important here than anywhere else. A supportive budget addressing these aspects will not only enable students to pursue their education dreams but also contribute significantly to India's long-term economic and intellectual growth.”

Equitable access to high-quality education

Rustom Kerawalla, Chairperson and Founder of VIBGYOR Group of schools said, “In the upcoming Union Budget 2024, we anticipate significant investment within the education sector. This includes enhancing infrastructure for effective education delivery, advancing teacher training, promoting inclusive education, and focusing on outcomes mapped to 21st-century skills. These priorities aim to ensure equitable access to high-quality education and build a resilient system that prepares students early on for real-world scenarios.”

He added, “Through collaborative tech-driven solutions, infrastructure upgrades, comprehensive training, advancements in pedagogy, and adapting to new-age learning methodologies, we can unleash the potential of educational reform.”



Strengthening the Digital Infrastructure

Rohit Manglik, the Founder & CEO of EduGorilla said, “Technology holds great promise to revolutionise the education sector. It plays a significant role in ensuring equity in access to education, making it more affordable, and enabling on-the-go learning. Hence, the Union Budget 2024-25 must earmark allocations towards strengthening digital infrastructure, such as the National Optical Fibre Network and ensuring reliable Internet connectivity.”

“It should also prioritise adopting new-age technologies beyond Artificial Intelligence, such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, which have opened new avenues for immersive and interactive learning experiences,” he added.

Investments into the nation’s talent-pool

Aalok Kumar, the Corporate Officer & Senior VP – Head of the Global Smart City Business Development Department and President & CEO of NEC Corporation India, highlighted that the Government of India presented an interim budget that reinforced its vision for‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047 - to accelerate India into a developed nation and foster inclusive economic participation among all citizens. “As we await the full budget, we expect clear and decisive provisions to advance this vision, with technology at the heart of this transformation.”

“While technology continues to drive India’s socio-economic progress, the key lies in building the nation into the knowledge capital of the world through enhanced R&D and innovation efforts. This will require continued and rigorous investments into the nation’s talent-pool through concerted training, skilling, and upskilling endeavours.”

Reduction in taxes for upskilling courses

Dr PR Sodani, the President of IIHMR University pointed out that with rapid technological advancements, students need to keep themselves updated for their secure future. “A reduction in taxes for upskilling courses will boost opportunities for innovation, inclusivity, allocation, and accessibility. Working closely with the healthcare sector, we urge for sturdy finance models to increase investment in healthcare infrastructure, consequently aiding the young minds engaged in health management studies.”

Reduction in GST on edtech services

Tarun Saini- CEO & Co-founder of Vidyakul, pointed out that edtech companies currently attract 18% GST, which impacts affordability in online education. “This is a concern that edtech companies have been talking about since the last budget session. A reduction in GST on edtech services will lower service prices, and boost affordability. We are hopeful the government will consider lowering the GST from the current 18%.”

“In addition to this, we are looking forward to a closer collaboration between policymakers, government, and startups in the form of PPPs (Public Private Partnerships) in the education sector. Connecting startups with education policymakers can create a powerful synergy to solve targeted problems and significantly enhance efforts to address critical issues,” he added.

Increasing the education budget to strengthen the educational framework

Sumit Singhal, Subject Matter Expert, at S.N. Dhawan & CO LLP, said, “The government should focus on increasing the education budget beyond 13% as it would provide continuous support for educational initiatives and further strengthen the educational framework.”

According to Singhal, such an increase would allow for more robust funding of critical programs, infrastructure development, and technological integration in schools and higher education institutions.”

Singhal also stressed on the need to reduce GST rates on digital educational content and services. “Lowering these rates would significantly enhance the affordability of online learning, which has become increasingly vital in today’s digital age. This measure would be advantageous for students by making high-quality educational resources more accessible, and at the same time, for edtech companies by fostering a more conducive environment for innovation and growth.”

He highlighted that a strategic increase in the education budget coupled with targeted tax relief measures can lead to substantial progress in the education sector, thereby benefiting students, and educators, and leading towards the transformation of the education sector.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/union-budget-2024-will-centre-meet-rising-demands-of-the-education-sector-here-s-what-experts-expect-in-latest-budget-101720684831700.html

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman speaks in the Lok Sabha during the interim budget session of the Parliament, in New Delhi (ANI)



This is despite the fact that the Finance Minister did not announce any changes in taxation in the interim budget this year presented on February 1.

What is an income tax slab?

India’s income tax is a progressive system, meaning that as a person’s income increases, the amount of tax they pay also increases, and the higher the income, the higher the percentage of the income they have to pay as tax, depending on the slab they fall into.

What are the current income tax slabs?

Income tax in India is divided into two types: The new tax regime and the old tax regime. The new tax regime introduced in 2020 is the default regime, with taxpayers having the option to switch to the old regime if they want to.

The current slabs for the new tax regime are as follows:

Up to ₹3 lakh: NIL

₹3-6 lakh: 5% on income which exceeds ₹3 lakh

₹6-9 lakh: ₹15,000 + 10% on income more than ₹6 lakh

₹9-12 lakh: ₹45,000 + 15% on income more than ₹9 lakh

₹12-15 lakh: ₹90,000 + 20% on income more than ₹12 lakh

Above ₹15 lakh: ₹1.5 lakh + 30% on income more than ₹15 lakh

For the old regime, there are three different slabs, divided on the basis of age groups; Below 60 years of age, which also includes the slabs for Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), 60-80 years of age, and above 80 years of age.

For people below 60 years of age and for HUFs

Up to ₹2.5 lakh: NIL

₹2.5 lakh – ₹5 lakh: 5%

₹5 lakh – ₹10 lakh: 20%

Above ₹10 lakh: 30%

For people aged above 80 years (Super Senior Citizens)

hindustantimes.com,Union Budget 2024: Why Budget presentation time was changed to 11am from 5pm?,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23 at 11 am. However, India always used to historically present the budget at 5 pm, switching to 11 am only in the year 1999. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman speaks in the Lok Sabha during the interim Budget Session of Parliament on Friday. (ANI)

Why was India’s Union Budget presented at 5 pm earlier?

The practise of presenting the budget at 5 pm came from the colonial era.



Since the Indian Standard Time (IST) is 4.5 hours ahead of British Summer Time (BST) and 5.5 hours ahead of the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), presenting the budget at 5 pm in India ensures that it is done during the daytime in England at either 12:30 pm BST or 11:30 am GMT for the convenience of the British.

When did India start presenting the Union Budget at 11 am?

India started presenting the Union Budget at 11 am in 1999 under Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government. Sinha was India’s finance minister from 1998 to 2002.



Apart from the fact that adapting to England’s time zone was no longer required, Sinha brought in the new change citing that it would allow more time for parliamentary debate and for analysing numbers of the budget.

The Union Budget was presented by Sinha at 11 am for the first time on February 27, 1999, following which, the practise has continued to the present day.

Why did India start presenting the Union Budget on Feb 1 of every year?

Historically, India has always presented the budget on the last day of February.

However, this practise changed in 2017 under Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who made the change citing ease of implementing new budgetary policies for the upcoming financial year which starts on April 1, due to the extra time of one month now available. There's also the reason that it is a colonial practise which is being brought to an end.

India also merged the Railways Budget with the Union Budget in the same year as these used to be presented separately earlier. This broke a 92 year tradition.



The Union Budget 2024 is being presented on July 23 since this was an election year and the interim budget was presented on February 1.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/union-budget-2024-why-budget-presentation-time-was-changed-to-11am-from-5pm-101720611331685.html

What are the various tax slabs currently in place?

The slabs for the new tax regime are as follows:

Up to ₹3 lakh: NIL

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: Why you must pay attention to fiscal deficit in Nirmala Sitharaman's speech,"What is fiscal deficit? Fiscal deficit is when there is more total expenditure for the government than its total income. This difference is generally covered by the government’s borrowings over the financial year, and therefore indicates the government’s borrowing requirements. India's fiscal deficit has been gradually reducing after a sharp uptick during the pandemic (Representational photo)



Fiscal deficit can be expressed as an absolute value or as a percentage of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

What is revenue deficit?

Revenue deficit is when there is more revenue expenditure like rent, salaries and wages, compared to revenue receipts like those from tax collections over the financial year.



Effective revenue deficit is the amount calculated when grants are subtracted from the actual revenue deficit figure.

What is the difference between fiscal deficit and revenue deficit?

Fiscal Deficit occurs when the government spends more than it earns as a whole, whereas revenue deficit occurs when the actual income of the government is lesser than the estimated income it requires to meet its expenses.

What was India’s fiscal deficit for 2023-24?

India’s fiscal deficit during the financial year 2023-24 was ₹16.53 lakh crore, or 5.6% of the GDP, with estimates for the same time period being 5.8%. This is a generally positive sign since it shows the amount of borrowings required to fund the government’s expenditure is lesser.

The COVID-19 pandemic was one of the main causes for this and the fiscal deficit shot up to 9.3% of the GDP during the financial year 2020-21 due to the unexpectedly high spending on healthcare and economic relief measures.



Ever since 2020-21, the fiscal deficit has been gradually decreasing again. In 2021-22, it was 6.9%, in 2022-23, it was 6.4%, and in 2023-24, it came down to 5.6% of the GDP.

What are the expectations on the Union Budget 2024 surrounding India's fiscal deficit?

The government is most likely to set the fiscal deficit target for 2024-25 at 5.1% of the GDP, according to reports. This is despite the fact that the government also plans to initiate tax rate cuts. However, the cuts are to stimulate consumption in the economy.

Aiding to the government's confidence in keeping the fiscal deficit target around 5.1% is the $25 billion dividend it received from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Deliberations are also underway over finalising a proposal to double the limit of the coverage amount from the existing ₹5 lakh to ₹10 lakh,"" they said.

In the Interim Budget 2024, the government increased the allocation for the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), which provides health cover of ₹5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to 12 crore families, to ₹7,200 crore.

Goldman economists expect the government to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 5.1% of GDP set in the interim budget but said it will likely make an ""overarching statement"" about long-term economic policy.



""We see an emphasis on job creation through labor-intensive manufacturing, credit for micro, small and medium enterprises, continued focus on services exports by expanding global capability centres, and a thrust on domestic food supply chain,"" Santanu Sengupta, chief India economist at the Wall Street bank wrote.

Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party failed to win a majority on its own in national elections this year and returned to power with the help of allies. Post-poll surveys showed that unemployment and inflation were key concerns among voters, particularly outside of urban areas.

How is the current situation with jobs in India?

While the Indian economy is seen growing a fast clip of 7.2% this year, job creation has lagged.



""Even 7% GDP growth might not be able to fulfill the job requirement over the next decade,"" Citi's chief India economist Samiran Chakraborty said in a note last week, adding that growth of close to 7% will generate 8 million to 9 million jobs per year, short of the 11 million to 12 million needed.

Goldman expects the budget to push labour intensive manufacturing through fiscal incentives across sectors like toys, textiles and apparel manufacturing, along with commercial aircraft manufacturing.

Citi, in a report, said the government could consider extending its flagship production linked incentive scheme with a focus on ""more domestic value addition and explicit employment targets.""

Almost two-third manufacturing jobs are in low-skilled labor-intensive sectors, Citi said, without specifying whether these announcements would be made in the budget.

Goldman also expects a focus on agricultural infrastructure and incentives to increase domestic production of key crops as a way to target high food inflation, which has been running close to 8% for many months.

hindustantimes.com,"Budget 2024: EV policy changes likely, already invested automakers may benefit","India may make changes to its new electric vehicle (EV) policy to incentivise automakers that have already invested previously, the Economic Times reported, citing unnamed people in the know. HT couldn’t independently verify the report. A view of a public electric vehicle (EV) charging plaza in New Delhi, India (Sanchit Khanna/HT)



The policy currently only supports fresh and new investments. The new changes may be announced in the 2024 union budget which will be unveiled on 23 July.

Why is the government potentially making changes to the EV policy?

This development comes when US EV maker Tesla still hasn’t committed to building a factory in India.



The government may consider investments in both EVs as well as vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (ICE), with about half a dozen carmakers such as Volkswagen-Skoda, Hyundai-Kia and VinFast having expressed interest in the new policy called the Scheme for Manufacturing of Electric Cars (SMEC), according to the report.

What are the details of the SMEC?

The government has said that it would allow imports of completely built up (CBU) EVs with a minimum cost, insurance, and freight value of $35,000 at 15% import duty for up to five years. But this is provided the company invests at least $500 million into the building of new plants



Initially restricting the SMEC for solely brand new EV plant investments was aimed to assess how much the companies were able to localise vehicle components. The scheme states that companies are required to build EVs with at least 25% of components sourced locally. This limit will increase to 50% by the fifth year of the investment, the report read.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/budget-2024-ev-policy-changes-likely-already-invested-automakers-may-benefit-101720414208580.html
hindustantimes.com,Union Budget 2024 set to outline five-year economic agenda of Modi govt,"The inaugural Union budget of the third Narendra Modi administration, set to be presented in Parliament by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23, is anticipated to outline a five-year action plan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi replies to the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address in the Lok Sabha. (PTI)

This plan aims to elevate India to the world’s third-largest economy, further solidify its fiscal position, sustain public expenditure to boost growth, enhance ease of living, and focus on farmers, women, youth, the middle class, and vulnerable populations, people aware of the matter said asking not to be named.

Sitharaman, presenting the Budget for the seventh consecutive time, is expected to maintain a policy of “continuity with improvements”. This approach aligns with the long-term goal of transforming India into a developed economy — or “Viksit Bharat” by 2047, according to the officials.

Union Budget 2024: Date, time and all you need to know

One of these officials pointed out that Prime Minister Modi, addressing the Rajya Sabha on July 3, emphasised that the government will accelerate and expand the pace of reforms undertaken in the last decade and take them to “new heights and depths” in terms of saturation during his third term.

The Budget will prioritise poverty eradication, as stressed by the Prime Minister in his Rajya Sabha speech. “That’s why the next five years will be decisive years for the fight against poverty... and this country will be victorious in this fight against poverty. I can say with confidence based on the experience of the last 10 years,” Modi had said.

The Budget is expected to provide a roadmap for elevating India’s economy from the fifth to the third position globally. A key strategy for achieving this ambitious medium-term target is “cooperative federalism”, where the Centre will encourage states to take the lead in attracting investments and implementing transformative reforms for ease of living in their respective provinces, the second official said.

One official noted that hints of this approach were evident in President Droupadi Murmu’s address to the joint session of Parliament on June 27. The President stated, “My government will present its first budget in the forthcoming session. This budget will be an effective document of the government’s far-reaching policies and futuristic vision. Along with major economic and social decisions, many historic steps will also be seen in this budget.”

The budget will be structured around several governance principles, with “nation first” at the forefront. Other guiding principles include “justice for all, appeasement of none”, “last mile delivery”, “saturation” of welfare programmes, and positioning India as a hub in the global supply chain with a robust manufacturing base.

Key highlights of the budget are expected to include providing houses to over 30 million poor, primarily in rural India, empowering rural women through the “Lakhpati Didi” programme, and maintaining focus on the Northeast region.

The Budget is also anticipated to emphasise attracting investments – both foreign direct investments (FDI) and domestic investments. Certain sectors such as semiconductor manufacturing, startups, and green hydrogen may receive special attention. Health, education, defence, public transport, and sports are likely to remain central themes.

The finance minister concluded her pre-budget consultations on Friday, covering various social and economic sectors. “Based on the inputs and feedback from experts and stakeholders, FM will prepare a practical, people-centric, growth-oriented annual budget while laying out a comprehensive mid-term development path,” the second official said.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-set-to-outline-five-yeareconomic-agenda-of-modi-govt-101720292084226.html

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman (PTI)

What does India's pharma industry expect from the 2024 Union Budget?

Anil Matai, Director General of the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) sought incentives for training pharmaceutical employees, along with effective intelectual property rights for the pharma sector, both domestic and global to introduce innovative therapies in India for addressing unmet needs.

He also recommended creating more centres of excellence (CoEs) for R&D on rare diseases.



Apart from this, ""expanding the list of life-saving drugs eligible for GST/import duty exemptions, including all oncology medications, will further improve patient affordability,"" Matai said, adding that the government should give incentives for investing in bonds of pharma companies.

OPPI represents pharmaceutical companies like AstraZeneca, Novartis and Merck, in India, that are involved in research.

Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) said that continuous investment in the pharma sector is crucial due to high risk, lengthy development periods, and low success rates in research.

The members of the IPA include Cipla, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Sun Pharma and Lupin.

What does the hospitality sector expect from the 2024 Union Budget?

The hospitality sector wants the government to give infrastructure status to hotels, rather than classify them a luxury, to make investments on new properties more attractive.



“The sector is burdened with high taxation, expensive and multifarious licences, approvals and compliances,” Hotel Association of India (HAI) President KB Kachru told PTI. “Hotels are capital intensive with a long gestation period. Cost of operating hotels is high and largely fixed.”

Lower utility tariffs, reduced property taxes, easier access to finance and softer loans are crucial for reducing the cost of doing business, ensuring the long-term viability of the sector, Chalet Hotels Ltd Managing Director and CEO Sanjay Sethi told PTI.

Royal Orchid Hotels Chief Finance Officer Amit Jaiswal said that that the hospitality sector has high expectations from the upcoming Budget, as it has been heavily impacted by recent economic fluctuations.

Jaiswal also said the sector anticipates favourable tax reforms, highlighting that ""India imposes one of the highest GST rates on tourism compared to countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and even European nations"".

Why is India's pharmaceuticals industry important?

India is the third largest manufacturer of pharmaceutical drugs after the US and China. India's pharmaceuticals market is projected to be valued at $130 billion by the end of this decade.

India is also known as a hub for generic drugs, which are cheaper versions of branded drugs.



India has offered incentives for drugs since 2020, but not for novel or newly founded drugs yet.

India's exports of generic drugs, which dominate the US generics market, is projected to double to $55 billion by 2030, according to the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil).

Why do pharmaceutical companies want incentives?

Asset management and research firm Bernstein said in March this year that India needs to create a domestic market where innovative drugs can be created and manufactured profitably at the right price, adding that insurance coverage for novel drugs and creating updated regulatory standards for manufacturing and clinical trials is needed for stimulating innovation.



""Spending millions on clinical trials with no pricing power is not a business they (pharma companies) want to be in,"" Bernstein said in an open letter to the prime minister.

“If the Indian government can give some income tax exemptions for 5-10 years for any new molecule developed in India, that can pull innovation to grassroot level,” Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech told Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Hyderabad on Friday. “Companies will start investing in innovation.”

This is similar to the labour rights index, an international qualification standard used as a tool to compare labour legislation around the world, considering 135 countries.

What has the government done to improve ease of doing business previously?

The government had previously taken steps to reduce the large number of labour laws, condensing as many as 44 labour acts into just four codes in the year 2019-20. These codes include Code on Social Security 2020; Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code 2020; Industrial Relations Code 2020; and Code on Wages 2019.

This was to improve the ease of doing business by reducing compliance needs and promoting decriminalisation.



The Union Budget is reportedly focusing on improving the ease of doing business this year, by decriminalising over 100 provisions across multiple laws, including the Income Tax Act, in the second edition of the Jan Vishwas Bill, Moneycontrol had reported, citing government sources.

The Jan Vishwas bill replaces criminal proceedings and imprisonment for minor offences, with monetary penalties, increasing the speed and efficiency of the justice system.

The key policy priorities for the third term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government would include dealing with stress in the agriculture sector, job creation, sustaining capex momentum, and pushing revenue growth to stay on the fiscal consolidation path.

Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her seventh budget in a row. With this, the finance minister is set to surpass Morarji Desai's record. Desai, as India's finance minister six decades ago, presented six consecutive budgets.

Till now, Sitharaman has presented six budgets during her five-year term as the finance minister, including the interim budget 2024 earlier this year. She is also the only woman finance minister to serve two terms consecutively.

In the interim Budget 2024, the Centre raised the capital expenditure target by 11.1 percent to ₹11.11 lakh crore for the fiscal year starting on April 1, accounting for 3.4 percent of the country's GDP.

hindustantimes.com,When will Nirmala Sitharaman present Union Budget 2024? Expected dates,"With the Narendra Modi-led NDA government taking charge, all eyes are now on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget 2024 in July, following the volatility the stock markets saw amid the exit polls and election results. A view of the Lok Sabha in the new Parliament building

So when will the full year Union Budget be presented? The timing of the opening session of Parliament is a topic of great interest.



The new Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju announced on X (formerly Twitter) that the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha will commence on June 24 and end on July 3.

The finance minister presented an interim budget on February 1. This interim budget is a temporary budget until the new government takes office. It usually avoids major policy announcements or changes.

The newly elected government presents a full budget for the financial year in July, detailing the new government’s economic policies, expenditures, and revenue plans for the entire fiscal year.



Reports had suggested that the government may prefer a session split by a recess, with the motion of thanks in the first part and the budget presented in the second, according to the sources quoted by the financial daily.

Now that the Lok Sabha session seems to have been split into two parts, the first may consist of the pro-tem speaker administering the oath of office to the newly elected MPs during the first two days.

The second part of the session may commence on July 22, with the presentation of the Union Budget 2024. The session will continue until August 9, consisting of 15 sittings, an ET report has said.

hindustantimes.com,Interim Budget 2024: Real estate developers welcome announcement on housing scheme for middle class,"PUNE As Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the interim budget on Thursday, stakeholders from the real estate sector in Pune said that the announcements took care of immediate and long-term goals, catering to various sections of the population. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the Interim Union Budget 2024 at the Lok Sabha of the Parliament House in New Delhi on Thursday. Developers welcome government’s plan to launch housing scheme for those living in rented accommodations, slums or chawls to buy or build their own houses. (ANI)

Sitharaman announced that the government will launch a housing scheme for those who are living in rented accommodations, slums or chawls to buy or build their own houses.

Reacting to the announcement, Ranjit Naiknavare, president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) Pune Metro, said, the government has announced a passing reference to special housing schemes for the middle class while showcasing its vision of a shift from ‘rental to self-owned housing.’

“This would encourage the deserving sections of the middle class to buy or build their own houses and would aid in the growth of the housing market,” he said.

“Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Gramin), three crore houses have already been built, and the government is now set to deliver two crore more housing in the next three years, which I find very promising,” Naiknavare said.

Vishal Gokhale, chairman and managing director, Gokhale Constructions, said, as this was the interim budget, no major announcements were expected.

“Announcements like the construction of two crore houses in the next five years under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and the plan to use solar energy on rooftops of 1 crore houses are quite welcoming. Similarly, the announcement to provide interest-free or low-interest loans of ₹1 lakh crore to the tech-savvy youth of the country for the next 50 years is promising for aspiring entrepreneurs,” he said.

Satish Magar, chairman and MD, Magarpatta City, said, “Centre’s budget despite being interim has focused on various things. The announcement of two crore houses is a welcome step while the new tax regime introduced previously will indirectly help the real estate sector.”

Corporate reactions

The continued focus of the Union budget on pivotal sectors is a commendable step. The new step to bolster deep tech in defence sector should be viewed as a strategic investment towards Atma Nirbharta in critical emerging technologies and aimed at providing a technical edge while boosting national security, said Baba Kalyani, chairman and MD, Bharat Forge.

‘Amritkal as Kartavyakal’ quoted by the finance minister during the interim budget 2024 is very opportune for realising the vision of Vikasit Bharat by 2047. Continued emphasis on green growth during this budget augers very well for achieving the Net Zero Goal by 2070. The announcement of a new scheme for propagating bio-manufacturing to introduce environment-friendly alternatives on regenerative principles is a welcome step for the inclusive growth of the farming community. This will further boost bio economy’s contribution to the nation’s GDP in times to come, said Pramod Chaudhari, executive chairman, Praj Industries Limited.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/interim-budget-2024-real-estate-developers-welcome-announcement-on-housing-scheme-for-middle-class-101706815543584.html
hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: Research & innovation corpus needs clarity of modalities involved,"The Union Budget proposal to create a corpus of ₹1 lakh crore for the benefit of private sector research and innovation, with a 50-year interest-free loan cushion, has raised more questions than answers. Since there are no details provided or any modalities offered, the industry is likely to adopt a wait-and-watch approach on the proposal. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, carrying a folder-case containing the Interim Budget 2024.(PTI)

The corpus looks to provide long-term financing and refinancing at low or nil interest rates. The intent is to encourage the private sector to scale up research and development in sunrise domains, in a country which spends a mere 0.7% of its GDP on scientific R&D.

In the previous budget, the Government had proposed setting up the National Research Foundation (NRF) as per recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) at a cost of ₹50,000 crore. Till date, the modalities of that proposal are not clear.

“One needs to understand the process of availing this corpus,” said Kris Gopalakrishnan, Infosys co-founder. His Trust (Pratiksha Trust) gave ₹450 crore for brain research to be done at the Indian Institute of Science’s Centre for Brain Research. “Hope the industry will take advantage of this,” he added.

As widely known, India’s R&D spending is significantly lower than not just the US or China, but also Japan and some other emerging countries. Traditionally, India hasn’t pulled its weight in the R&D stakes, with many large Indian conglomerates not giving it the importance it deserves.

‘Not enough, but good start’

Gopichand Katragadda, who was earlier the Group Chief Technology Officer and Innovation Head at Tata Sons and former managing director at GE’s Indian R&D centre, said it is better not to spend anything at all on R&D than spend 0.5% of the GDP or less.

“There’s not going to be any outcome if the spend is insignificant. Our R&D spend should cross 2% of the GDP,” he said. “But it’s a good start,” he said, referring to the corpus.

Without a doubt, IP laws and patents have not been on the top of the industry agenda for many years. The onus should lie with the companies to create IP. While the government is trying to support with external funding, it has to also ensure how the money is spent and who gets it. An audit has to be done on what outcomes were expected and what outcomes were delivered after the funding, said Katragadda, who is now the founder of Myelin Foundry, a deep tech startup.

Unless details are provided and the modalities are worked out, it’s better not to get too excited about the large corpus. “The NRF example is in front of us,” said Ramkumar Narayanan, former chairman of Nasscom’s Deeptech Council. “They haven’t announced how NRF will be deployed from last year’s Budget. This was supposed to be handled by the office of the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) but there are no details yet.”

If India has to climb up the R&D value chart, the productization of research has to happen more rapidly. Participation in academic research has to go beyond just a handful of tier-I institutions. There’s also a need for patient capital especially when it comes to deep tech entrepreneurship. For the wider economy to prosper, R&D has to be given prime importance, especially with India looking to fly on the wings of the knowledge sector.

“Just like in the US, we also need robust publicly funded research communities that create knowledge and innovation that the companies can use,” said TV Mohandas Pai, chairperson of Manipal Global Education and a leading investor in startups. “The government funds only institutes like the IITs and some public sector institutions, for research. That’s not enough. It’s the private sector that needs to do cutting-edge research and innovation and hence they need support,” he said.

On the pharma front, India enjoys the tagline ‘Pharmacy of the world’, catering to 20% of the global supply of generic drugs. India is ranked third in global pharma production by volume, but 14th by value. For India to climb the ladder in terms of value, R&D will have to play a larger role. So is the case in the technology industry.

While leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, lauded the Budget as inclusive and innovative, leaders of the Opposition termed it ""disappointing and hollow"".

Here's who said what about the Interim Budget 2024.



Budget guarantees of making India a developed nation by 2047: PM Modi

In a video message, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the Interim Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, saying that it offers the ""guarantee"" of strengthening the foundation of a developed India.

Budget shed light on milestones achieved by the Modi govt: Amit Shah



Union Home Minister Amit Shah said the Interim Budget 2024-25 draws the roadmap to achieve PM Modi's vision of a developed India by 2047.

He pointed out that Sitharaman's speech in the Parliament sheds light on the milestones achieved by the BJP government in the last 10 years.

""The Union Budget draws the roadmap to achieve PM Shri @narendramodi Ji's vision of a Developed Bharat by 2047. The budget speech sheds light on the milestones achieved by the Modi govt in the last 10 years on its journey to make Bharat the foremost nation in every sector during the Amrit Kaal,"" Shah wrote on X.

He also told reporters outside Parliament that even though Budget presented is an interim one, it still presents a hope for the way ahead.

Housing scheme announced in Budget is a revolutionary step: JP Nadda

BJP president JP Nadda on Thursday asserted that the housing scheme announced in the Budget is a revolutionary step.

""This far-sighted budget lays the foundation of a developed India. The housing scheme for the middle class announced in this budget is a revolutionary step...We don't just give the slogan of 'Garibi Hatao' but alleviate poverty. The target for Lakhpati didi has been raised to 3 crores. MSME sector to be made global. The tourism and renewable energy sectors have been focused upon in this budget..."" he told ANI.

Nadda was referring to the announcement of a new housing scheme for the middle class to buy or build homes as part of the Interim Budget for 2024-25. In her speech, Sitharaman said that the scheme would help deserving sections of the middle class currently living in rented houses, slums, chawls and unauthorised colonies to buy or build their own house.

Budget speech was short and disappointing: Congress' Shashi Tharoor



Congress MP Shashi Tharoor referred to Sitharaman's Budget speech as one of the shortest on record and alleged that it was disappointing.

“It was one of the shortest speeches on record in the Budget. Not very much came out of it. As usual, a lot of rhetorical language, very little concrete on implementation,” Tharoor said.

He added: ""She (Sitharaman) talked about foreign investment without acknowledging that investment has come down significantly.""

Budget speech mere grandstanding: Congress' Manish Tewari



Congress leader Manish Tewari said what was ""extremely worrying"" was the increasing fiscal deficit because the numbers that have been presented by the finance minister clearly demonstrate that over ₹18 lakh crore is the unfunded extent of the Union Budget, and ""the number is going to increase over the next year"".

""If you leave that aside for a moment, the rest of the budget speech was a mere grandstanding. It was like driving looking into the rear view mirror rather than looking ahead,"" he was quoted as saying by PTI.

This was Modi govt's farewell budget: Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav claimed this was the Narendra Modi government's farewell budget.

""If any budget is not aimed at development, if any budget is not for the people than it is a waste. The BJP government has made a shameful record of the governance over the last ten years, which will never be broken because a positive government will soon come.

hindustantimes.com,Union Budget 2024: How do we move forward on PVTGs?,"In a bid to promote inclusivity and generate grassroots impact, Union Budget 2023 had allocated ₹15,000 crore for the development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) under the PM Janjati Adivasi Nyay Maha Abhiyaan (PM-JANMAN). Out of over 700 Scheduled Tribes, the PVTGs make up 75 of those communities and are located in 18 states and the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. These communities are often secluded and isolated from the rest of the settlements hence they have larger gaps in infrastructure, education, health, drinking water, power and telecom facilities which impede availing state benefits such as ration shops, aanganwadis, and banking facilities, and more. The Mission launched in November 2023 and announced a total approved outlay of over ₹24,000 crore, to be distributed over a three-year period.

During these three years, the development of PVTG blocks is to be carried out as ""aspirational blocks"" under the Aspirational Block Development (ABP) Programme.This ambitious project, implemented in partnership with NITI Aayog, focuses on 11 vital interventions across five themes: health & nutrition, education, agriculture & water resources, financial inclusion & skill development, and basic infrastructure. The ABP Programme adopts a base-over-apex approach, prioritising the requirements and implementation of schemes at the block level of governmental administration. This approach prioritises rapid development of rural areas across sectors by extensively planning for a compact area like a development block. As per the government, the motive of the programme is to improve the quality of life of people living in the most backward blocks of the country.

The PM-JANMAN guidelines, published by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) underlines the principle aim of the Mission to saturate PVTG families and habitations with basic facilities and services. It is a joint endeavour of 9 ministries, with MoTA as the nodal ministry, where each ministry will implement its respective central sector and centrally sponsored scheme, while collectively informing the saturation of the habitations. The guidelines highlight the role of the state-level administration in customising and adapting the programs to specific contexts and requirements. At the block level, the administration focuses on implementing schemes on the ground and ensuring access to benefits reaches all intended recipients. The Programme encourages competitiveness among block administrators, following one of the main principles of ABP known as ""Competition Federalism"". Monthly progress rankings of all 500 blocks across various development areas are displayed on the Champions for Change' portal, fostering a competitive governance mechanism that incentivises administrators to improve their performance and achieve specific development outcomes.

This raises the question of whether it would be more beneficial to adapt and tailor central and state schemes/projects at the block level. India's geographic diversity presents varying topographies, features, resources, and access, which are accompanied by context-specific issues and challenges. Therefore, customising schemes and policies based on the unique parameters that influence a certain administrative segment could yield higher benefits on the ground, especially considering the competitive incentives for block administrators. For example, PDAG’s ongoing study suggests that constructing heterogeneous pucca houses, tailored to the requirements of specific households rather than following a uniform approach, would better serve the purpose of resource generation. This could involve building barn sheds as part of houses where animal produce plays a significant role in the livelihood and sustenance of the household, rather than constructing identical structures for all.

Furthermore, not all 500 selected blocks are at the same level of progress and development. It is recommended to concentrate efforts on a smaller number of blocks that are in urgent need of government assistance and interventions, and that have the least development and access across multiple socio-economic parameters. Improving these broad categories, which are essential for the advancement of PVTGs requires a detailed action plan spanning several electoral cycles to ensure long-term stability in their progress. PVTG settlements are often isolated from nearby habitations, making long-term planning and having a focused approach necessary to improve access to necessities, alternative livelihood opportunities, market integration, and to address preconceived notions held by surrounding communities. Even if access to facilities is increased, the prejudices of caste and social standing often translate into better employment opportunities, and education and health care access. This means that pointed interventions for social assimilation would become imperative as the projects and policies progress and adapt.

It is important to acknowledge that these recommendations are crucial for formulating comprehensive policies that address the unique challenges posed by individual habitations, terrains, community concerns, social isolation, and other factors. Given the diversities across the 500 Aspirational Blocks, most blocks will not have a similar starting point on any of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), making it inappropriate to view it as an equitable race. Therefore, identifying structural gaps and predisposing factors in each unique block is essential for the successful implementation of the ABP. Creating a competitive environment may discourage block officers who require more resources and infrastructure, as they may not be on an equal footing with other blocks. This could lead to a focus on quantity rather than quality in implementing long-term policies.

hindustantimes.com,"Budget 2024: Old vs new tax regime, which is better for salaried employees?","The new tax regime was introduced in Union Budget 2020 under which the tax slabs were altered and taxpayers were offered concessional tax rates. But taxpayers who opt for the new tax regime cannot claim several exemptions and deductions. These include HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D and more. In Union Budget 2023, the government introduced crucial changes to encourage taxpayers to adopt the new tax regime. These are: Budget 2024: Understanding the difference between old and new tax regime is important.

Higher tax rebate limit: Full tax rebate on an income up to ₹7 lakhs has been introduced. This threshold is ₹5 lakhs under the old tax regime. This implies that taxpayers with income up to ₹7 lakhs will not have to pay any tax at all under the new tax regime.

Streamlined tax slabs in the 2023 changes: The tax exemption limit has been increased to ₹3 lakhs and the new tax slabs are:

Income up to ₹3,00,000- Nil

Income up to 3,00,001- 6,00,000- 5%

Income up to ₹6,00,001- 9,00,000- 10%

Income up to ₹9,00,001- 12,00,000- 15%

Income up to ₹12,00,001- 15,00,000- 20%

Income up to ₹15,00,001 and above- 30%

What about the old tax regime?

The old regime prevailed before the introduction of the new regime under which over 70 exemptions and deductions were available, including HRA and LTA, which can reduce your taxable income and lower tax payments. The most popular and generous deduction is Section 80C that allows for a reduction of taxable income up to Rs.1.5 lakh.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/budget-2024-old-vs-new-tax-regime-which-is-better-for-salaried-employees-101706685296931.html

The interim budget typically takes care of the fiscal needs of the intervening period until a government is formed after the Lok Sabha polls. One of the key aspects of the annual Budget is the allocation of funds towards the defence sector.(File Photo/HT)

One of the key aspects of the Budget is the allocation of funds towards the defence sector. Follow full coverage of the 2024 Interim Budget here.



Over the years, the Narendra Modi government has laid emphasis on making India ‘Aatmanirbhar’ or self-reliant in defence. Since 2014, the year Modi took oath as prime minister, the government has introduced several reforms in the defence sector.

Here are the key budget announcements for the defence sector during the budgets in the past 10 years.

Defence Budget in 2023

Last year, the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre hiked the defence budget for 2023/24 by 12.95 per cent - from ₹5.25 lakh crore to ₹5.94 lakh crore.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that this was done to allow the military to develop and/or buy advanced weapons systems, including new fighter jets, submarines and tanks.

The armed forces' modernisation budget also saw a hike - ₹1.52 lakh crore to ₹1.62 lakh crore. A significant portion of this is for acquisition of weapon systems and equipment from domestic manufacturers in line with the government's 'Make in India' programme.

Defence Budget in 2022

In the budget present in 2022, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman allocated ₹5,25,166 crore for the Defence secters. It was subsequently reached to ₹5,55,484 crore, constituting 14.08 per cent of the central government's expenditure.



Sitharaman had said that 68 per cent of the capital procurement budget for the defence sector would be earmarked in 2022-23 for local industry. This was to reduce the country's dependence on imports of defence equipment and have a more 'self-reliant' defence sector under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.

Defence Budget in 2021

In 2021, the Defence Budget was earmarked at ₹4,78,196 crore with revised expectations reaching ₹5,35,508 crore. This constituted 14.20 per cent of the central government's expenditure for the year. The government at the time called for a push towards defence modernisation with an 18.75 per cent increase in defence capital outlay.

Defence Budget in 2020

In the fiscal year 2020-21, India's Defense Budget was initially projected to be ₹4,71,378 crore. However, the actual expenditure surpassed this estimate, reaching ₹5,23,330 crore amid a border row with China that saw India make a raft of emergency purchases and sharpen its focus on building infrastructure in forward areas.

This amount accounted for 14.91% of the central government's total expenditure. Additionally, the allocation for Defense Pension witnessed a notable increase, reaching ₹1,33,825 crore, representing a rise of ₹40,367.21 crore compared to the preceding year.

Defence Budget in 2019

India’s defence budget during the interim budget of 2019-20 stood at ₹3.18 lakh crore. This included a capital outlay of ₹1,03,394 crore. The interim budget was presented by former finance minister Piyush Goyal.

The actual expenditure surpassed this estimate, reaching ₹5,23,330 crore or 18.20 per cent of the central government's expenditure that year.

Defence Budget in 2018

In 2018, India allocated ₹2.95 lakh crore for military spending during 2018-19, a modest hike of 7.8% over last year’s budget. The budget included a capital outlay of ₹99,563 crore for buying new weapons and systems. Arun Jaitley, who was the finance minister at the time, had said the NDA government had laid emphasis on modernising and enhancing the military’s operational capabilities.

Defence Budget in 2017

In 2017, India hiked its allocation on defence spending by a marginal 6%. Finance minister Arun Jaitley allotted ₹2.74 lakh crore for defence spending in 2017-18 – including ₹86,488 crore for modernization.

The actual expenses, however, reached ₹4,17,242 crore, constituting 19.48 per cent of the central government's expenditure.

Defence Budget in 2016

The Narendra Modi-led government in 2016 announced it would spend ₹2.58 lakh crore on defence in 2016-17, a marginal hike of 9.7% over last year’s revised estimates.

The pension component of the budget stood at ₹82,332.66 crore, with the outgo towards implementing the one-rank-one pension scheme contributing to the financial burden. The allocation for military modernisation in the budget stood at ₹87,209.63 crore.

Defence Budget in 2015

India marginally raised its defence spending in 2015 as former finance minister Arun Jaitley had announced an outlay of ₹2,46,727 crore for 2015-16, an increase of 7.7% over the previous year’s budgetary estimates and 10.95% if calculated against revised estimates.

The defence spending included ₹94,588 crore for buying new weapons and equipment, a jump of merely ₹5 lakh over last year’s capital expenditure.

Defence Budget in 2014

In the first budget of the Modi government, the government had put emphasis on attracting foreign investment, as Arun Jaitley proposed raising the FDI cap in defence and insurance sectors to 49% from 26%.

Jaitley also increased the capital outlay of defence by ₹5,000 crore, including ₹1,000 crore for the development of railways in border areas.

The step is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's thrust on the expansion of the defence industrial base in the country and enhancing self-reliance in the defence sector, apart from venturing into exporting military items.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/budget-2024-modi-govts-big-announcements-in-defence-in-past-10-years-101706705165329.html
hindustantimes.com,Union Budget 2024: Empowering unorganised workers,"The Economic Survey of 2021–2022 estimates that 43.99 crore people worked in various forms of informal employment in India during the 2019–20 fiscal year, making up a significant proportion of the country's unorganised workforce. Domestic workers stand out within this large group as a pertinent but frequently disregarded chunk of the population that diligently supports households all around the country.

The government may address the long-standing injustices faced by these individuals through the Interim Budget 2024, laying the groundwork for extensive social security reforms, as India is moving towards for its general elections in April. Shedding light on the provisions in the 2020 Social Security Code, we explore the possible challenges in the implementation of the social security funds intended for unorganised sector workers. Examining these obstacles, we make recommendations, especially with regard to the e-shram portal, to ensure that any new provisions effectively benefit individuals at the grassroots level.

India plans to establish a sizable social security fund for workers in the gig economy and unorganised sector. This fund was envisioned in the 2020 Social Security Code and marks a critical step towards achieving universal social security coverage.

India's labour reform initiatives, which aim to promote ethical labour practices and safeguard the rights of businesses and workers, include the Social Security Code of 2020. Out of the four codes, Social Security Code 2020 is essential for providing social security benefits to workers, including those in the gig economy and unorganised sector. It seeks to strike a balance between company and workers welfare by combining 29 labour statutes. The code is also anticipated to help India facilitate ease of doing business.

The Social Security Code of 2020 represents a substantial increase in coverage, especially for workers who were previously not covered by the laws in place, such as gig workers and platform workers in the rapidly growing e-commerce industry. The Code provides essential benefits like life and disability coverage, maternity benefits, and pensions to gig workers. It also includes the unorganised sector, temporary workers, and migrant workers who work beyond state lines, broadening the purview of social security programmes. Notably, another previous coverage gap has been filled as fixed-term contracts are now eligible for coverage. The objective of the Code is to guarantee complete social security coverage for a diverse workforce by streamlining compliance and using a consultative approach through inspector-cum-facilitators and uniform definitions.

The overarching goal is to bring together all current social security programmes—which address health, housing, education, old age, pensions, provident funds, and health—under a single, all-inclusive Social Security Fund. This consolidation aims to streamline administration, enhance accessibility, and ensure comprehensive coverage for all segments of the workforce. Through these concerted efforts, the government aims to create a more efficient and equitable social security system that effectively addresses the diverse needs of the workforce. In pursuit of this objective, the government launched e-shram portal, to get the number of unorganised workers in the country.

In 2021, the ministry of labour and employment established the e-shram portal to facilitate the registration of unorganised workers and building a comprehensive national database. It enables an unorganised worker to self-declare and register under 400 occupations across 30 major occupational areas on the platform.

The e-shram platform was launched in August 2021 and has since gathered data on over 293.3 million unorganised workers. By leveraging the data collected through the e-shram platform, and now encompassing information on unorganised workers, the government is in an adequate position to provide benefits to these workers. However, there remains the question of the reliability of this data and its accuracy in representing the diverse and dynamic nature of the unorganised labour sector.

According to the most recent data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, India suffers from a significant digital divide. The country's total teledensity was 88.07%, while in rural areas it was just 60.10%. Based on a 2017–18 National Statistical Office (NSO) poll, only 18.4% of people aged 15+ were skilled in computer operation, while 22.9% were proficient in internet usage.

In the context of the online registration process for the Social Security Code, this digital gap comes across as a serious challenge, particularly for India's 93% unorganised labour force, which frequently works in poor circumstances for little pay. It's probable that people without cell phones don't have the digital literacy, which is needed to use the portal efficiently. To make things more difficult, employees who constantly alter their contact information may not be able to register because the process requires an active phone number connected to Aadhaar. Given the technological shortcomings related to Aadhaar authentication, requiring Aadhaar for social security benefits raises difficulties. Aadhaar linkage to benefits financed by the Consolidated Fund of India is restricted as a result of the Supreme Court's ruling in the Puttaswamy case, as government bodies and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour have noted.

Moreover, the scheme only applies to individual workers who register; it does not allow for the inclusion of information on the workers' families or dependents. Workers who are 60 years of age or older are being excluded. The Shram Suvidha Kendra is the only organisation that authenticates workers for registration, which may result in exclusion while managing the database that contains information on over 43 crore people.

In order to ensure that all workers benefit from the planned provisions in Budget 2024, it is essential that these challenges be addressed. It is imperative that the digital divide in India be addressed. The Aadhaar requirements and low digital literacy provide challenges for the unorganised labour population. Furthermore, data inclusion and accuracy are also impacted. To improve accessibility and inclusion, a number of measures need to be taken. Some of these can include the following:

· Alternative government-issued ID cards should be recognised as a valid form of identity verification for workers.

· Flexibility and user-friendliness would be improved by enabling employees to register using any desired number and to change it as needed.

· Workers who encounter digital difficulties should be accommodated by enabling offline registration through registration camps and common service centers.

· Door-to-door campaigns, local events, and a dedicated helpline for portal-related concerns would all contribute to the simplification of the registration process and increasing awareness.

As next steps, the government can enhance its efforts to address the challenges outlined above and ensure a more accessible and inclusive social security system for all Indian workers. Through the implementation of these measures, the government may efficiently close gaps and establish a strong social security system that meets the varied requirements of the labour force.

Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.(PTI)

Following a request put forth by Karnataka Minister NS Boseraju, the chief minister penned a letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

On January 25, Karnataka's Minister of Minor Irrigation, Science, and Technology, NS Boseraju, formally petitioned the chief minister, seeking the establishment of AIIMS in Raichur.

""This demand aligns with our manifesto commitment and is a reflection of the aspirations of the people of the district. Raichur has witnessed a persistent 625-day-long Satyagraha led by various organizations and advocacy groups, emphasizing the crucial need for AIIMS in the region,"" the state government said in a release on Tuesday.

Recognized as an aspirational district by the central government, Raichur holds special significance under Article 371(J) of the Constitution, which

hindustantimes.com,Union Budget 2024: Why Economic Survey won't be presented on January 31 this year,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting the interim Union Budget 2024 on February 1, Thursday.

Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran along with Principal Economic Adviser Sanjeev Sanyal and Rajiv Mishra show the Economic Survey 2021-22, (PTI)

However, this year the Economic Survey will not be presented a day before the interim Budget is announced by the FM. The reason behind this is that this is not a full budget, but an interim budget being presented by the government.

What is the Economic Survey?

The Economic Survey is a document presented by the Centre a day before the Union Budget, and it is a comprehensive annual report which displays the performance of the Indian economy in the past fiscal year, highlighting the highs and lows for better insights for the future.

The Economic Survey is presented by the Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) on the eve of the Budget presentation, giving a highlight on how the previous budget worked and providing insights on what could come next for the Indian economy.

Why no Economic Survey on January 31?

Since this is not a full fledged Budget session, the Economic Survey will not be presented this year. In fact, no major announcements or changes in policy will be announced on February 1, since FM Sitharaman will only be presenting the interim Budget 2024.

The Lok Sabha elections 2024 are set to take place this year in April-May, which is why a full budget is not being presented by FM Sitharaman. A complete budget and the Economic Survey will be presented in July, when the results are declared and a new cabinet is appointed.

Since the survey document will not be out tomorrow, the Ministry of Finance released a report titled “Indian Economy – A Review"" on Monday, January 29, giving the top highlights in the Indian economy from the part 10 years.

Indian Economy-A Review states that India will become a $5 trillion economy the next 3 years and could reach $7 trillion by 2030. India is poised to surpass a GDP growth rate of 7.2% in FY24, outpacing the global economy’s struggle to achieve a growth rate exceeding 3%, the report states.

It is expected that Indian economy will see a growth of 7 percent in 2024 for the third consecutive year.

It is expected that the Centre will make some changes to their welfare scheme, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. The interim Budget 2024 will be presented on February 1 (File)(HT File)

While no major announcements are expected in the interim budget, the government might increase the PM Kisan scheme payout by 50 percent this year, from ₹6000 to ₹9000 per year, reported The Economic Times.

The ET report said that economists believe that the increase of the payout in the PM Kisan scheme for farmers is one of the three major social sector announcements expected during Union Budget 2024.

Further, economists also said during a poll that Centre's housing scheme - PM Awas Yojana - will be one of the prime focuses of the government during the Budget 2024 presentation.

According to last year's budget, the outlay of PM Kisan scheme was ₹60,000 crore. This is expected to see a 50 percent increase this year. Apart from welfare schemes, the Centre is expected to continue the push for capital expenditure, as private sector investment is yet to pick up across sectors, the report added.

The government ramped up capital expenditure by almost a third annually in the past three years, prioritizing spending on roads, ports and power plants. These sectors are also expected to see a boost during the upcoming Budget 2024 session.

All-party meeting ahead of Budget 2024

An all-party meeting has been called ahead of the presentation of the interim Budget 2024 presentation, to be convened on Tuesday by the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Pralhad Joshi.

It is a customary practice ahead of every session as leaders of different parties highlight the issues they want to raise in Parliament, and the government offers them a glimpse into its agenda and seeks their cooperation.

It must be noted that FM Sitharaman will only be presenting the interim Budget in the Parliament on February 1, while the complete Union Budget for the upcoming fiscal year will be presented after the Lok Sabha elections and the appointment of the new cabinet.

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: Here's what stakeholders expect for higher education in India,"The Finance Ministry allocated Rs. 1.12 lakh crore to the education sector for the fiscal year 2023-24. Of which the Department of Higher Education was allocated Rs. 44,095 crore. NEP mainly aims to achieve the establishment of at least one large multi-disciplinary higher education institution in every district, improving accessibility, increase in research & innovation and expanding the vocational training of the students.((Raj K Raj/HT Photo))

The allocated amount received by the Department of Higher Education is used to fund central universities, IITs, NITs, and other centrally funded universities. Funding for higher education regulators UGC and AICTE, grants and scholarships for research are among the functions carried out by the Department of Higher Education.

“ I look forward to the forthcoming budget with the expectation that it will align with NEP 2020. A substantial increase in budgetary allocation for education, from 2.9% to 6% of the GDP, is crucial for the policy to deliver its full potential and attain national objectives on the path to global leadership,” said Rajendra S Pawar, Chairman and Co-Founder, NIIT Group.

Institutional Restructuring

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 sets a target of achieving a 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education by 2035. This would require intensive institutional, infrastructural and policy changes to align with the mandates in NEP.



“In the upcoming budget, we anticipate a significant emphasis on elevating higher education. This entails a strategic allocation of augmented funds towards infrastructure development, research endeavors, and skill enhancement initiatives. The infusion of additional financial support is poised to empower educational institutions to revamp facilities, embrace cutting-edge technologies, and attract top-notch faculty. This increased funding not only fortifies institutions but also plays a pivotal role in augmenting the overall quality of education, nurturing a highly skilled workforce,” says Dr Yajulu Medury, Vice-Chancellor, Mahindra University.

Vocational Training

In the context of the higher education arena in the country, NEP mainly aims to achieve the establishment of at least one large multi-disciplinary higher education institution in every district, improving accessibility, increase in research & innovation and expanding the vocational training of the students.

With NEP setting targets of achieving 50% GER in higher education, employment and job opportunities for the graduates will have to be addressed. This is where vocational training for students comes into play.

“ The government's efforts in implementing skill development programs have set the stage for positive change. However, there is a need to strengthen industry-academia collaboration for better alignment of academic curricula with the evolving job market. Moreover, prioritising financial support for Academic-Industry Collaboration is crucial, as it serves to forge robust connections between educational institutions and industries. This strategic emphasis ensures that academic curricula stay abreast of the ever-evolving demands of the industry, thereby nurturing a workforce equipped with agility, adaptability, and preparedness for future challenges. Additionally, it's important to extend support to COA-approved Institutes with larger research grants akin to those provided to AICTE. This will foster innovation and excellence in education,” says Dr Prof Anand Achari, Principal, Vivekanand Education Society’s College of Architecture.

Research and Innovation

Research and innovation will step up our game in pushing our education sector as a global study destination. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, the total expenditure budget for Research and Innovation was Rs. 210.61 crore.

Statutory bodies University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) were allocated Rs. 5,360 crore and Rs. 420 crore, respectively. Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) was allocated Rs. 9,661.50 crore and NITs and IIEST were allocated Rs. 4,620 crore.



“ In anticipation of the upcoming budget, I propose a few key areas of focus. Establishing a National Design Research Fund will support innovation and attract talent, improving faculty development and infrastructure. Addressing the faculty shortage by incentivising the hiring of foreign faculty members can enhance the quality of design education. Encouraging collaboration between design institutions and industries through tax incentives will provide valuable opportunities for students. Additionally, increasing scholarships and grants is crucial for making design education accessible to diverse backgrounds, ensuring that talent from all walks of life contributes to our creative landscape. Additionally, creating an innovation ecosystem, leveraging cultural heritage, and aligning India's design policy with global trends are vital,” says Dr Sanjay Gupta, Vice Chancellor, World University of Design.

Access to Higher Education

Improving the inclusivity and accessibility of students to higher education, especially from rural areas is imperative. Improving access to education among members of socio-economically disadvantaged groups like SC and STs is also being discussed by experts.

Bridging the digital divide, increasing the exposure and availability of digital learning are some aspects that the stakeholders believe focus should be laid upon for the next fiscal year.

“Addressing issues like gender disparity, access to quality education in rural areas, and the need for increased investment in education are crucial in achieving equitable and inclusive education for all,” says Shweta Sastri, Managing Director, Canadian International School, Bangalore.

Student Loans

Experts believe giving the student community relief on student loans can help in favour of the education ministry as a large section of people rely on them to pursue their studies. A favourable decision in terms of student loans can also help students who look forward to studying aborad for their higher studies.

“There is a need to upscale the education system to attract more foreign students to the country and India should be promoted as a global study destination. A large part of the population depends on educational loans to pursue their studies. Hence, encouraging more students to take up their course of interest with lower interest rates on such loans is essential for their optimal growth and development,” says Shweta.

“It is expected that the budget will address the concerns surrounding the Tax Collected at Source (TCS) rate, which directly impacts students studying abroad. Especially curious about possible ways to reduce TCS's influence on remittances for costs associated with education. Options like zero forex international cards, which are free from TCS up to Rs. 7 lakhs annually, would be very helpful for students who are struggling financially. To mitigate the effects of TCS on tuition and travel expenses, the budget may guide parents who are sending money overseas for their children's education. It may also encourage responsible financial decisions. Also, we anticipate budgetary proposals that would increase the availability of student loans. It's laudable that the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) should reach 50% by 2030, and we're interested to see how the budget will help achieve this goal,” says Raghwa Gopal, CEO of MSM Global.

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024 expectations: Stakeholders pin hopes for Edtech and AI integration,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is all set to present the interim budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 on February 1. Expectations are running high among the stakeholders who hope that the fiscal decisions propel the journey of the education sector towards the goals set to be achieved. The education sector was allocated Rs. 1.12 lakh crore in the previous budget (fiscal year 2023-24) announcement which is nearly an 8.26 percent increase in the allocation in comparison to the 2022-23 allocation.

The education sector was allocated Rs. 1.12 lakh crore in the previous budget (fiscal year 2023-24) announcement which is nearly an 8.26 percent increase in the allocation in comparison to the 2022-23 allocation.

Edtech sector expectations

The future of Edtech came to the fore with the impact of COVID-19 hitting the education sector as hard as it could. The challenges of accessibility for students during and after the pandemic found answers with the flexibility to choose the online, offline or hybrid mode of learning through digital learning.

The stakeholders in the Edtech sector have their hopes pinned on the interim budget for GST slab reduction, building an ecosystem for enhanced AI integration in education, improving accessibility in rural areas and much more.



“In view of the upcoming interim Union Budget, we would like to appeal to the government to increase the education sector’s budget and reduce the GST slab from 18% to 5% on educational products and services. Our aim is to establish a strong foundation for the country’s children, particularly those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Additionally, given the evolving world and our shifting approach to education, driving a change to ensure affordable and quality education at scale needs more collaboration for public and private sectors. For this, reducing the GST on educational services would also remove financial strain on parents, promoting affordability. Apart from this, focusing on collectively enhancing youth skills to increase employability and reduce skilling gaps is imperative for the Indian economy’s growth,” says Prateek Maheshwari, Co-Chair, India Edtech Consortium (IEC), Co-Founder- Physics Wallah (PW).

According to experts, students from rural regions can benefit from the reduction in tax slabs by making quality education affordable for all.

“For India to become a developed nation by 2047, we need to transform our school and college systems. NEP 2020 encourages schools to move beyond books to provide multi-modal education (audio-visual, activity-based learning, etc.). However, all technology and learning hardware to schools are currently taxed at either 18% or 28%. GST relief on school solutions will make goods and services for education more affordable and will help foster educational innovation and transformation, thereby vastly improving access to affordable and high-quality education for all,"" says Sumeet Mehta, Co-founder & CEO, LEAD Group.

“With technological advancements happening every minute, relying just on a college education is not enough for the Indian youth. They will have to keep updating and upskilling themselves to utilise their full potential in strengthening our economy. Removal or Reduction of GST rate from upskilling programs in the upcoming Union Budget will help solve this by democratising access to quality education, fostering innovation and employability. Formalising the edtech sector and streamlining operations through regulations and policies instils confidence among stakeholders, fostering an environment conducive to growth. These changes ultimately align with the national goal of developing a more responsive education system, equipping the workforce in this knowledge-driven economy to meet the evolving demands of the job market,” says Mohan Lakhamraju, Founder and CEO of Great Learning.

“ In the upcoming Union Budget for 2024, ed-tech startups can anticipate substantial support for the educational sector. The government's commitment to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 signals a clear intent to drive reforms and embrace digital education. With the edtech sector set to reach a USD 4 billion mark by 2025, the budget is likely to introduce measures that encourage innovation, skill enhancement, and quality learning. The surge in edtech during the pandemic underscores its crucial role in shaping India's global education standing. As the government continues its proactive approach witnessed in the past year, ed-tech startups can look forward to a budget that aligns with the evolving needs of the sector, contributing to the nation's educational growth and competitiveness,” says Kavita Sharma, Co-founder and CEO, Ziyyara Edutech.



AI integration in education

With the influence of AI gripping stronger, it is imperative to include AI, AR, VR, metaverse, etc technologies integrated into the education sector which aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.

“India is at the cusp of a massive transformation. The Education sector has an important role to play in this pathway towards becoming a Viksit Bharat by 2047, not just by developing the intellectual pool but also by contributing to the socio-economic development of the country. The goals outlined in the NEP 2020 and the ever-evolving industry demands have resulted in a paradigm shift from one-way teaching to a learning-by-doing methodology. This has resulted in a recalibration of the academic curriculum with the inclusion of emerging technologies namely, AI, AR/VR, metaverse, cybersecurity etc. With recent policy developments, there has been a significant focus by the Government towards the internationalisation of higher education to foster student exposure, international mobility, research and innovation. This will require a convergence of world-class infrastructure, the curriculum of global standards and increased industry partnerships. In this context, it is anticipated that the Budget 2024 will not only address the immediate short-term concerns but will also set the trajectory of the future knowledge landscape,” says Dr Dhara Thakore, Head of Incubation and Office of Career Services, Anant National University.

“ AI-based technology has been a major driver in recent months and the trend will only accelerate. A call for heavy investments, a progressive policy framework, and increased R&D expenditure is clearly needed for India to catch up with the world in these areas. The government's role is pivotal in fostering an ecosystem that fuels AI innovation, bringing academia, industry, NGOs, and government departments together. As we envision a future powered by AI, India's investment must not only be monetary but also strategic, facilitating collaborative synergies for a thriving ecosystem,” says Prof P J Narayanan, Director, IIIT Hyderabad.

Integrating emerging technologies in education, both in school as well as the higher education landscape is the need of the hour to give our educational sector a globalised makeover. Upskilling and reinforcing the student community in the job market requires institutional and infrastructural changes as mentioned in NEP 2020.

“ The pandemic has underscored the importance of technology in education. The budget should focus on bridging the digital divide by ensuring access to digital devices and internet connectivity, especially in remote areas. According to the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) report for 2021-22, only 34% of all schools in India have internet access, leaving a significant 66% without it. Strategic investment in Internet facilities, e-learning platforms, digital content, blended teaching-learning facilities, and teacher training in digital pedagogies will be instrumental in making education more inclusive and future-ready,” says Niru Agarwal, Trustee, Greenwood High International School.

hindustantimes.com,Explainer: Why Union Budget 2024 will not be a full-fledged one,"A brief Budget session of Parliament, the last of the 17th Lok Sabha, will be held between January 31 and February 9. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Lok Sabha.(ANI)

During the session, the interim budget for 2024-25 will be tabled by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1.

However, Sitharaman will not be presenting the full budget in the Parliament, but instead will table a vote on account or interim budget in the House.

Why a full budget will not be presented this year



In an election year, the Union government tables an Interim Budget outlining expenditures and revenues until a new government is formed. This interim budget helps the government to manage its financial obligations.

A full-fledged Budget is expected to be unveiled in July following the formation of the newly elected government. Conventionally, an Interim Budget is also known as a ‘vote-on-account’.

Under Article 116 of the Constitution, a “vote on account” refers to an upfront allocation from the Consolidated Fund of India to the government, intended to cover its short-term expenditures,

How Interim budget is different from a full-fledged Budget?



An Interim Budget outlines the government's anticipated receipts and expenditures until the new government is formed. In contrast, a full-fledged Budget encompasses all facets of government finances, including earnings, spending, allocations, and policy declarations.

A comprehensive annual Budget serves as a strategic roadmap, outlining the economic course for a nation throughout the fiscal year. While on the other hand, an interim budget furnishes financial specifics for the transitional period.

Interim Budgets also have certain limitations imposed by the Election Commission of India to ensure no undue influence on the voters. The government cannot propose major taxes or policy reforms in the budget as it can influence voters in favour of the ruling dispensation.

Traditionally, the government avoids announcing major policies during a “vote on account”, even though there is no constitutional prohibition against making substantial announcements.

In December, Sitharaman had ruled out any “spectacular announcement” for her sixth budget on February 1 this year, saying it would simply be a “vote on account” before the general elections.

“No spectacular announcements come in that time (in a vote on account). So you will have to wait till after the new government comes in and presents the next full Budget in July 2024,” the minister had said in response to a question about a “supercharged budget” during her address at the CII Global Economic Policy Forum.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/explainer-why-union-budget-2024-will-not-be-a-full-fledged-one-101706090880348.html

State-owned Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) and Ircon International emerged as the top gainers, with the shares of both rallying more than 7 percent.

The Uttar Pradesh government’s December 19 announcement of a new policy intends to cater to the stalled housing projects. (Sunil Ghosh/HT Photo)

Tax exemptions

In its pre-Budget wish list, the body of real estate developers, Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (CREDAI), has urged the government to increase tax exemption limit on principal amount as well as interest paid on home loans to boost demand for residential properties.



In its pre-Budget recommendations, it suggested that the deduction for principal repayment of housing loan should be considered for a separate or standalone exemption. CREDAI has sought deduction under section 80C for principal repayment of housing loan should be increased from the existing limit of ₹1.5 lakh.



Colliers India also recommended increasing the deduction limit for interest repayment on home loans can lead to higher disposable income in the hands of affordability of homebuyers especially for the EMI dependent ones. The existing limits of principal repayment of housing loans under section 80C can be raised further providing a boost to sales of housing units. Key expectations include a separate and higher deduction for housing loan principal repayment, currently capped at ₹150,000 under section 80C.

Limit on tax deduction on interest paid should be increased from the current ₹2 lakhs to about ₹3-4 lakhs in case of self-occupied property. In case of let-out property, limits can be dropped entirely, it said.

""Interest exemptions under 80EEA and 80EE (applicable for first-time homebuyers in affordable housing) can be increased from current capping of ₹150,000 and 50,000 respectively. Tax exemptions for first-time homebuyers, especially in the affordable segment, should be reintroduced,” said Badal Yagnik, Chief Executive Officer, Colliers India.

Changes in definition of affordable housing

The real estate sector has also recommended standardization and rationalization in the definition of affordable housing across government schemes and financial institutions can help homebuyers qualify for cheaper financing options in the particular category.



Credai noted that the definition of affordable housing, which was capped at ₹45 lakh, was given in 2017 and is yet to change since.

Due to inflation alone, there has been a significant rise in real estate prices in the past 7 years. As per data from the National Housing Bank (NHB), there has been an increase of 24 per cent in housing rates since June 2018 in India, which makes the current cap of ₹45 lakh extremely unfeasible for developers to adhere to, Credai said in its list of recommendations.

It recommended that the definition of affordable housing be revised as ""a unit with 90 square meter RERA carpet area in Metros Cities and 120 square meter RERA Carpet Area in Non-metros without a cap on cost of the unit"".

Colliers India said that with the government's ambitious Housing for All initiative at its final leg, there is a widespread hope for targeted incentives and subsidies to boost affordable housing projects. Potential measures could include tax breaks for developers focused on affordable housing, thereby encouraging increased supply to meet the rising demand in urban and rural areas. A 100% tax holiday for affordable housing projects under Section 80IBA should be re-introduced, it said.

Grant infrastructure status to the real estate sector

The real estate sector also wants the government to grant it infrastructure’ status that will ensure easier access to institutional credit and help reduce developer’s cost of borrowing.

Greater retail engagement in REITs

The Union Budget 2024-25 should explore initiatives to boost greater retail engagement in REITs.

“REITs and InvITs have made a significant contribution to the growth of the real estate and infrastructure sectors. To further help these instruments grow, certain long-standing tax asks aligning these instruments with listed equity shares is imperative. The recent SEZ rule amendment is a progressive policy reform which will help REITs and other commercial real estate companies unlock vacant spaces in the IT/ITeS Parks, while adding to employment creation and boosting economic activity. An amendment to the CGST Act, enabling real estate players to avail input credit during the construction phase, will also help reducing costs and support the growth of this asset class,” said Ramesh Nair, CEO| Mindspace Business Parks REIT.

The February 1 budget is anticipated to strike a balance between populist measures and fiscal prudence while narrowing the fiscal deficit, according to the survey conducted from January 10-19 with 41 economists. FILE: People watch the Union Budget being presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament. (HT PHOTO)



Reuters poll of economists on Union Budget 2024: 5 estimates

• In the backdrop of an election year, the budget, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is pitching for his third term, is anticipated to navigate a delicate equilibrium between populist schemes and fiscal responsibility.

• According to the polls, the February 1 budget is projected to focus on narrowing the fiscal deficit to 5.30 per cent of GDP in 2024-25.

• Notably, the poll revealed that none of the economists identified education and healthcare as the primary budgetary concerns.

• Respondents highlighted infrastructure investment (34) as the foremost priority, followed by rural development (17) and job creation (16), given the challenge of accommodating millions entering the workforce annually.

• Additionally, the focus on deficit control is expected to limit the expansion of welfare schemes, and gross borrowing is predicted to remain largely unchanged at 15.60 trillion rupees from the current year's projection.

Why do economists think fiscal deficit will narrow?

The government is aiming to narrow the fiscal deficit to 4.50 per cent of GDP by the end of the 2025-26 fiscal year (FY) from 5.90 per cent in the current year to the end of March.

""To achieve the (2025-26) 4.5% deficit target, total expenditures would need to rise by no more than 7% per FY on average...meaning an even more aggressive cut to expenditures is likely in the coming years,"" said Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics.



‘Education should be the main priority’

""Continued and rapid improvement in India's infrastructure will be paramount to reviving the private investment cycle,"" Hermann said.

""But to leverage India's huge potential and ensure sustainable and inclusive growth over the medium to longer term, human capital levels will need to improve, which is why spending on education should be the main priority.""



'Informal sector continues to struggle'

""There are growth challenges that we remain wary of. Private non-infrastructure business capex is conspicuous by its relative absence,"" said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Societe Generale.

“Stress is more visible in the rural areas as the informal sector continues to struggle, especially MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) which are the biggest job generators.”

The full-fledged Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 will be presented after the formation of the new government following the general elections this year. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman at 'Halwa Ceremony' last year.(X/@FinMinIndia)

Leading up to the presentation, a traditional “Halwa Ceremony” will precede the event annually. This ceremony, hosted and attended by the finance minister and other officials, marks a notable prelude to the Budget presentation.

What is Halwa ceremony?

The ceremony signifies the official initiation of the printing process for various documents related to the Budget. The ceremony holds importance in the conclusive stages of the extensive budget-making procedure that spans several months.

The event serves as a formal ‘send-off’ for ministry officials and staff engaged in preparing the Union government's annual financial statement. Subsequently, they enter a designated ‘lock-in’ period, isolating themselves within the ministry premises, cutting off from their families to preserve the confidentiality surrounding the final budget document.

The staff are allowed to exit the North Block only after the finance minister tables the budget in Lok Sabha on February 1.

This ceremonial activity will take place in the finance ministry's basement within Central Delhi, home to a dedicated printing press. The finance minister initiates the proceedings by stirring the ‘halwa’ in a large metal pot or kadhai.

Why are there restrictions before Budget presentation?

Budget preparation is a confidential process carried out by the finance minister in collaboration with high-ranking officials. Those involved in this process undergo a period of lockdown and are prohibited from using mobile phones until the budget is officially presented. Various entities, including ministries, states, union territories, defence forces, and other departments, are tasked with preparing estimates. The budget proceeds to the printing stage only after receiving approval from the prime minister.

Aside from the finance minister's movements within or outside the restricted area where stenographers and officials are stationed, surprise visits to the printing press area in the basement of North Block are reportedly conducted by the chief of the Intelligence Bureau.

In case of emergencies, the families of the quarantined officials have the option to leave a message on a designated number, although direct communication is not permitted.

These stringent measures trace back to a leak that occurred in 1950.

1950 Union Budget leak

The security protocols of this highly classified process faced a breach in 1950 during John Mathai's tenure as the finance minister. A segment of the 1950 Union Budget was leaked when the document's printing was underway at Rashtrapati Bhawan. In response to this breach, the printing venue was relocated to a government press on Minto Road. Since 1980, the North Block basement at Delhi's Secretariat Building has been established as the permanent location for budget printing.

Following the leak, finance minister Mathai, facing allegations of serving the interests of higher powers and affluent individuals, resigned.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/budget-2024-what-is-halwa-ceremony-conducted-ahead-of-budget-presentation-101705757743132.html

Rahul Walawalkar, Founder and President of India Energy Storage Alliance and President & MD, Customized Energy Solutions (CES), India said the country has a great opportunity to become a global hub for supply chain of advanced battery manufacturing ecosystem.

IESA expects the upcoming Union Budget 2024 to consider a special incentive program for battery raw materials and chemical processing and tax incentives which will bring more investments to India's fast-growing energy storage industry.

In its memorandum, the IESA emphasized on 10-year tax holidays for projects with standalone battery energy storage using renewables to charge the battery, Storage with Transmission element, & Storage with Renewable plants.

It also asked for a GST reduction for various energy storage.

According to the current GST regime, the tax rates on lithium-ion batteries are 18 per cent. The GST for advanced batteries on the higher side ranges between 18 per cent to 28 per cent.

Other than lithium-ion, all other battery chemistries are attracting 28 per cent GST, it pointed out.

The IESA has suggested that the government considers the reduction in the GST rate and bring a uniform rate of 5 per cent GST. The body has also asked for avoiding double taxation on energy storage systems.

In line with the principles of double taxation avoidance, Electricity Duty (ED) and Cross Subsidy Surcharge (CSS) may not be made applicable on input power for charging ESS, as these systems are merely facilitating conversion of energy where electricity is stored during off peak hours and discharges during peak hours.

The ED and CSS may only be levied on the final consumption of electricity, it suggested.

Given the large-scale requirement of battery storage in India, IESA has requested to increase the capacity of the production-linked incentive scheme of ACC Battery Manufacturing of capacity from the current 50GWh to 100 GWh catering requirements of the EV sector and stationary storage applications.

The Indian government has set an ambitious target for battery manufacturing in the country. It aims at setting up a cumulative 50 GWh of capacity for advanced chemistry cells (ACC) by 2025.

IESA has requested to extend other benefits like affordable funding and easy access, common facility centres for manufacturing clusters (training Centre, quality lab, skill development Centre etc which can benefit entire Industry), Public procurement order etc. to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME).

IESA has also recommended that India sets a roadmap to increase its GERD (Gross domestic expenditure on R&D) to 2 per cent of GDP by 2030. This requires increasing the Central Government spending on R&D by 20 per cent annually starting in 2023-24 through 2030, with a commensurate increase in the Extramural R&D funding.

It also stressed that RBI should create a separate lending arm within its lending portfolios like retail, housing, corporate, etc. It also asked to reduce the reduction of GST on electrolyzer (equipment used to produce green hydrogen) from 18 per cent to 5 per cent.

It also suggested reduction of GST on hydrogen that qualifies as green hydrogen from 12 per cent to 5 per cent.

IESA is a leading industry alliance focused on the development of advanced energy storage, green hydrogen, and e-mobility technologies in India.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/budget-2024-industry-body-seeks-tax-holiday-on-standalone-battery-energy-storage-101705581673177.html

Nirmala Sitharaman will present the interim Budget 2024 on February 1 (Hindustan Times)

Some additional tax waivers and exemptions at the lowest level, only in the Old Tax Regime are expected to be announced during the presentation of the interim Budget 2024, a senior government official told Business Standard.

It is expected that the new changes in the Old Tax Regime will include some additional measures for women farmers and an income tax exemption rates close to ₹7 lakh, the report said.

However, it is projected that the new measures, along with the announcements to improve the direct taxes, will not hurt the fiscal deficits of the government. No concrete announcements regarding the same have been made by the government yet.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the interim budget next month, and it has already been made clear by the Centre that there will be no ""spectacular announcements"" on February 1, since the budget will only be presented for vote-on-account.

The complete Union Budget 2024 will be presented by the finance minister in July, after the results of the Lok Sabha elections are declared and the new government cabinet has taken charge.

Interim Budget 2024: What can we expect

FM Sitharaman has said previously that no major tax announcements or changes to policy will be presented in the Union Budget 2024 on February 1. This budget is only being implemented in an interim capacity, for the first quarter of the new financial year.

The finance minister said earlier, ""It is a matter of truth that the February 1, 2024, Budget that will be just be a vote on account… we will be in election mode… so the Budget will just be to meet the expenditure no spectacular announcements are made at that time.""

It is expected that the interim budget will only include the Economic Survey, estimates for upcoming financial year, and vote-on-account in Parliament on immediate expenses like salaries of government employees or funding of ongoing projects.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/union-budget-2024-centre-may-revise-tax-exemption-in-old-tax-regime-says-report-101705393710421.html
hindustantimes.com,Railway budget 2024 to rise 25% to hit record levels,"Budgetary allocation for Indian Railways is expected to hit record levels in 2024-25 as the government gears up to support a major makeover for the national transporter with additional modern and faster trains and improved safety features. A file photo of a Vande Bharat Express train during its flag-off ceremony at the Katra Railway Station,

The capital expenditure (capex) for the railways is likely to be increased by about 25% from the 2023-24 budget estimate, two people aware of the development said. That would take the budgetary allocation to more than ₹3 lakh crore in 2024-25.





The railway ministry had sought an increase in its planned capex for long-term infrastructure projects of freight corridors and speedier trains, as well as modernising the fleet with new-age trains, wagons and locos, one of them said.

The increased capex would also go towards rolling out 300-400 Vande Bharat trains in different formats, including one with sleeper coaches, as well as overhauling the signalling systems.

The safety budget of the railways is expected to be almost doubled to help it accomplish its Mission Zero Accidents faster, this person said. The safety budget has remained stagnant for the past two years at around ₹11,000 crore.

The finance and railway ministries did not reply to queries until press time.

“Higher plan capex allocation for [Indian] Railways is the need of the hour as the national transporter reaches a critical stage of implementing key infrastructure projects,” said Subodh Jain, a former member of the Railway Board.





“The government supported (the railways) with an over 50% increase in gross budgetary support in 2023-24, and the expectation is that absolute support would touch new levels next year, even though the growth may be half of last year’s numbers,” he said.

Of the total capital allocation of around ₹2.45 lakh crore for Indian Railways in the 2022-23 budget, the Centre’s gross budgetary support stood at around ₹1.6 lakh crore.

Gross budgetary support swelled to ₹2.4 lakh crore in 2023-24, when total capital allocation for the railways stood at ₹2.6 trillion. The expectation is that over 90% of the capital allocation would flow through the government’s gross budgetary support in 2024-25 as well.

Gross budgetary support is the actual amount that a government body receives from the general budget.

Indian Railways needs to be adequately funded so it can build new infrastructure. With the Centre finding it easier to borrow at attractive rates from the market, it is expected that capital spending of key infrastructure sectors, including railways and roads and highways, would come from the government’s gross budgetary support.

This support for the railways has been steadily increasing—to ₹1.17 lakh crore in 2021-22 from ₹70,250 crore in 2020-21, ₹69,967 crore in 2019-20 and ₹55,088 crore in 2018-19.

After decades of supporting revenue expenditure, gross budgetary support over the last few years has focused on supporting the railways’ capex.

The people privy to the government’s thinking said that of the higher gross budgetary support extended to Indian Railways in the budget, a good portion may be kept for the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project, work on which is going on at full pace for both Gujarat and Maharashtra tracks.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/union-budget-2024-railway-budget-to-rise-25-to-hit-record-levels-101705030227004.html
hindustantimes.com,Union Budget 2024 to focus on 5 key social sections,"Budget 2024: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s pre-election budget is set to focus on welfare schemes for five key sections of society—women, poor, youth, farmers and tribals—as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) aims a third term in office on the back of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of inclusive growth. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.(File)

Accordingly, allocations for existing schemes for these sections of the society are likely to see an enhancement while new schemes may be announced, two persons privy to discussions in the government said.

“Schemes meant for these sections of the society will get emphasis in the budget. For example, education and skill development will get special attention, addressing the aspirations of the youth,” one of the two people said.

Farmers are expected to benefit from a likely 33% increase in the social transfer under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi. (HT graphics)

The Centre allocated over ₹1.12 lakh crore for the two departments handling school education and literacy and higher education in 2023-24. The welfare of women will also be a key pillar of Sitharaman’s budget speech on February 1 given Modi’s vision of women-led development. In the recently held assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, women voters were a focal point and both Congress and BJP, which won the state poll, had offered schemes for women.

For the ministry of tribal development, which implements schemes for the welfare of tribals, the allocation was raised sharply in 2023-24. “That trend is set to continue in 2024-25 as well,” said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the 2023-24 budget, the allocation for the ministry saw an increase of nearly 71%, a major part of which went for the Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) programme that provides free education to children from scheduled tribes from classes six to eleven in a residential set-up. Indicating the government’s emphasis on tribals, the government’s drive to ensure welfare programmes reach all eligible persons who have not yet been covered—the Vikasit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, was flagged off at Khunti, a village in Jharkhand with substantial tribal population, on 15 November by Modi, the person cited above said.

Farmers are expected to benefit from a likely 33% increase in the social transfer under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi. Under the scheme, ₹6,000 is transferred every year to small and marginal farmers. In 2023-24, the Centre allocated ₹60,000 crore for this scheme, which will go up commensurately in 2024-25, said a second person, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. Exact budgetary allocations for different ministries for the next fiscal are currently being worked out. While the government gets an early sense of the expenditure pattern for the current year, the revenue receipt trends are known as the fiscal year draws to a close.

An email sent to a finance ministry spokesperson seeking comment on Wednesday remained unanswered.

Experts pointed out that the strategy of addressing the needs of the vulnerable sections of the society through the budget while separately undertaking reforms and making it easier for doing business are likely to help the ruling coalition connect with not only the masses but also with the well-off while pursuing development goals. “The government is already focused on the aspect of inclusiveness in politics. The Modi government has transited to class politics. Indian politics, which has traditionally been seen as caste-centric has now become class-centric, which is a fundamental shift in Indian politics,” said A.K. Verma, the director of the Centre for Study of Society and Politics.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/union-budget-2024-to-focus-on-5-key-social-sections-101704933362866.html

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: What are direct taxes? Types and significance,"For the sixth consecutive year, Union minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 on February 1. This presentation will be an interim Budget due to the impending Lok Sabha elections this year. The complete budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 will be introduced after the formation of the new government. Examples of direct taxes include income tax, real property tax, personal property tax, and taxes on assets. (Representational Image)

Before this year's Budget presentation, try understanding what constitutes a direct tax and who needs to pay it.

A direct tax refers to a tax where the individual or organisation directly pays the government without intermediaries. It is imposed and directly paid by the individuals or entities it applies to. Examples of direct taxes include income tax, real property tax, personal property tax, and taxes on assets. These taxes are paid by the taxpayer directly to the government.

Difference between direct and indirect taxes

A direct tax is the opposite of an indirect tax, wherein the tax is levied on one entity, such as a seller, and paid by another – such as a sales tax paid by the buyer in a retail setting.



Direct taxes cannot be shifted to another party and remain your responsibility to pay. Indirect taxes are the opposite. Whoever is liable for these taxes can pass on or shift them to another person or group

Here are some types of direct taxes

Income Tax: Income tax payments are based on an individual's age and earnings, with various tax slabs set by the government to determine the amount owed. The taxpayer is required to file Income Tax Returns (ITR) annually, possibly resulting in either a refund or a payment based on the return. Failure to file ITR can lead to significant penalties.

Wealth Tax: This tax, paid yearly, hinges on property ownership and its market value. Owning property incurs wealth tax, irrespective of whether it generates income. Corporate taxpayers, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), and individuals are subject to wealth tax based on their residential status. However, certain assets like gold deposit bonds, stock holdings, and properties rented for over 300 days, among others, are exempt from wealth tax.

Estate Tax: Also known as Inheritance Tax, it's paid based on the value of an individual's estate or remaining assets after their death.

Corporate Tax: Domestic companies and foreign corporations earning income in India are liable to pay corporate tax. Income from asset sales, technical service fees, dividends, royalties, or interest based in India is taxable. Corporate tax includes other levies such as Securities Transaction Tax (STT), Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT), Fringe Benefits Tax, Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT), and Capital Gains Tax.

Capital Gains Tax: Paid on income gained from the sale of assets such as farms, bonds, shares, businesses, art, and homes, categorised as capital assets.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/budget-2024-what-are-direct-taxes-types-significance-explained-income-tax-interim-budget-nirmala-sitharaman-101704645225237.html

The incoming government will present a full budget later in the year. People watch an earlier Union Budget being presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament. (HT PHOTO)

Here are some FAQs on Union budget:

What is a Union budget?

It is an annual financial statement that lays out the government’s proposed expenditures and revenues for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins on April 1st of that year, and ends on March 31st of the following year.

It can also be described as a ‘comprehensive document that outlines the government’s economic and fiscal policies for the next fiscal year.’

Preparation of budget

The process begins six months before the financial statement's tabling in Parliament. The finance ministry allocates revenues to departments; disputes go to the prime minister or Union cabinet for resolution.

The finance minister, meanwhile, discusses proposals and demands with stakeholders, and finalises decisions with the prime minister.

How is budget presented?

Each year, Parliament's budget session begins on January 31, with the President of India's address to a joint sitting of the two Houses – Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. The document itself is tabled the next day, in Lok Sabha, the Lower House.

The 2017 budget was the first to be presented on February 1, a shift from the previous years, when it was presented on the last working day of the month. It was also the first to include announcements related to Railways; before September 2016, the latter was a separate entity, and presented days before the Union budget.

The ‘halwa’ ceremony

The ‘halwa’ ceremony marks the final stage of the budget presentation process and precedes the ‘lock-in’ process of the budget's tabling. During their ‘lock-in,’ officials involved in budget's preparation are housed inside the Budget Press in North Block, to prevent leaks. They come out only after it has been tabled.

‘Paperless’ budget

Since 2021, the budget has been ‘paperless’; i.e. it is read out from a tablet. This practice was adopted due to Covid-19 but has stayed on.

Can someone else present budget?

In February 2019, which was again an interim budget, it was tabled by Union minister Piyush Goyal, who was assigned finance as an additional portfolio in absence of then finance minister Arun Jaitley, who was ill and receiving treatment in the United States.

Can I access budget documents online?

Yes, all 14 documents are uploaded on the ‘Union Budget Mobile App.’

Why is budget important?

It is closely watched by businesses, investors, and the general public as it provides insight into the government’s economic policies and priorities and can have a significant impact on the economy and people’s lives.",,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/budget-2024-here-are-the-most-common-faqs-on-union-budget-101704199999426.html

Union budget 2024-25.(AFP)

In the document, apart from the liabilities, the government also announces a slew of welfare schemes, necessitating significant expenditure. So, from where does the government get its money?

From where does Centre gets its money?

Government spending is balanced by its revenues and loans. Take a look at how the government got its money for expenditure, as mentioned in the Union budget document 2023-24.

The Budget draws its major share from borrowings and liabilities, constituting the largest chunk of 34 per cent.

(Hindustan Times)

The budget is presented by the union finance minister in the Parliament. The budget is a comprehensive document that outlines the government’s economic and fiscal policies for the next fiscal year.

How is the budget prepared?

1. The fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31, requiring parliamentary approval of the budget before April 1.

2. The budget process starts six months before the financial statement is presented in Parliament, commencing deliberations in August-September of the previous year.

3. Ministries receive a circular to prepare estimates, followed by extensive consultations with Niti Aayog, and approved data is sent to the finance ministry.

4. The finance ministry allocates revenues to departments; disputes go to the prime minister or Union cabinet for resolution.

5. The finance minister engages in pre-budget meetings, discussing proposals and demands with stakeholders, finalising decisions with the prime minister.

6. Before the budget presentation, a 'halwa ceremony' is held, initiating a 'lock-in' for ministry staff to prevent leaks, lasting until the financial statement is tabled.

hindustantimes.com,Budget 2024: Sitharaman to present interim budget on Feb 1. Explained,"Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the interim budget on February 1, 2024, extending its validity until the upcoming general elections.

(Hindustan Times)

What is the need of Budget?

According to the Constitution, the Union government's revenue and loans are held in the Consolidated Fund of India, and drawing from it requires parliamentary approval. Thus, the budget, which also has a projected income and expenditure statement, is passed to appropriate funds for the upcoming financial year.

What is an interim Budget?

During election years, the outgoing government refrains from imposing policy changes or budget constraints on its successor.

The Interim Budget, a parliamentary norm during election years, allows the government to cover expenses until the new government takes charge.



What is a vote on account?

In another circumstance, if the financial year has ended and budget is yet not passed, the government can’t access funds until the appropriation bill's enactment. To address immediate expenses, the Constitution empowers the Lok Sabha to grant funds in advance for a part of the financial year, known as the 'Vote on Account.'

Then finance minister Arun Jaitley started presenting the union budget on February 1 from 2017, thus no need for vote on account for this purpose.

So, the vote on account presently is used mostly through the Interim Budget, granting temporary permission for administrative expenses until the new government is formed, typically valid for two months and extendable.

FM Sitharaman confirmed that the February 1, 2024 budget will solely be a vote-on-account due to the impending elections, with the full-fledged budget anticipated in July.

What is difference between interim budget and vote on account?

• Interim Budget encompasses both expenditures and receipts; Vote on Account lists only government expenditures.

• Interim Budget undergoes discussion and passage in the Lok Sabha; Vote on Account, specific to expenditures, is passed without discussion.
