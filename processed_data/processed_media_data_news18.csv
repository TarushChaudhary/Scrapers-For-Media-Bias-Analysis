news18.com,"Income Tax Slabs Post Budget 2024: New Tax Regime Vs Old Tax Regime, Which One Is Beneficial for You?","With the announcement of the full Union Budget 2024-25, taxpayers in India are once again faced with the decision of choosing between the new tax regime and the old tax regime. Though the latest Budget has made the new tax regime more attractive, experts said it should still be seen on a case-by-case basis. Here’s the comparison of the income tax slabs under the new and old tax regimes for FY 2024-25, and which is more beneficial for different types of taxpayers.

Here are the income tax slabs for FY 2024-25:

New Tax Regime (FY 2024-25)

The new tax regime, introduced in the Budget 2020, aims to simplify the tax structure by offering lower tax rates while eliminating most deductions and exemptions. Here are the revised income tax slabs under the new tax regime for FY 2024-25:

Income up to ₹3 lakh: Nil

₹3 lakh – ₹7 lakh: 5%

₹7 lakh – ₹10 lakh: 10%

₹10 lakh – ₹12 lakh: 15%

₹12 lakh – ₹15 lakh: 20%

Above ₹15 lakh: 30%

2. Old Tax Regime (FY 2024-25)

The old tax regime allows taxpayers to claim various deductions and exemptions, such as HRA, LTA, and Section 80C, among others. The income tax slabs under the old tax regime for FY 2024-25 are as follows:

Income up to ₹2.5 lakh: Nil

₹2.5 lakh – ₹5 lakh: 5%

₹5 lakh – ₹10 lakh: 20%

Above ₹10 lakh: 30%

New Tax Regime vs Old Tax Regime: Which is Beneficial for You?

1. For Low-Income Earners (Up to Rs 5 Lakh)

“For individuals with an annual income of up to Rs 5 lakh, both regimes offer similar tax benefits due to the standard deduction under the old regime and the basic exemption limit in the new regime. However, the new tax regime might be slightly more advantageous due to its lower tax rates,” a tax expert said.

2. For Middle-Income Earners (Rs 5 Lakh – Rs 10 Lakh)

Middle-income earners who have limited investments and do not claim multiple deductions might find the new tax regime more beneficial due to its lower tax rates. On the other hand, those who extensively utilize deductions under Section 80C, 80D, and HRA may save more under the old tax regime, he added.

3. For High-Income Earners (Above Rs 10 Lakh)

“High-income earners who have significant investments and claim numerous deductions will likely benefit more from the old tax regime. The higher tax rates in the new regime may offset any savings made through lower tax rates if deductions are not claimed,” the tax expert said.

4. For Salaried Individuals

Salaried individuals with substantial exemptions like HRA, standard deduction, and Section 80C investments may find the old tax regime more favorable. The new tax regime, although simpler, may not offer the same level of tax savings for those who maximise their deductions, he said.

The expert, however, added that if no or very less investments or deduction options are available, the new tax regime is beneficial for salaried individuals also, he added.

“It is necessary to do a computation on both the regimes to conclude which regime is better for salaried individuals. However, for those who have no investments, the new tax regime is better,” he said.

5. For Self-Employed Individuals

Self-employed individuals with fewer opportunities to claim deductions may find the new tax regime more appealing. The lower tax rates and simplified structure can lead to significant tax savings for those who do not have substantial investments in tax-saving instruments.

“The choice between the new tax regime and the old tax regime for FY 2024-25 depends largely on the taxpayer’s income level, investment habits, and financial goals. While the new tax regime offers simplicity and lower rates, the old regime provides substantial savings through deductions and exemptions. Taxpayers should carefully evaluate their financial situation and consult a tax advisor if necessary to make the best decision,” the tax expert said.",Left,Center,https://www.news18.com/business/tax/income-tax-slabs-post-budget-2024-new-tax-regime-vs-old-tax-regime-which-one-is-beneficial-for-you-9022197.html
news18.com,Nirmala Sitharaman In Lok Sabha: No State Has Been Denied Money In Budget 2024,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday termed misleading claims by opposition leaders that if any state is not named in the Budget speech, then it does not get any budgetary allocation.

Replying to a Budget discussion in the Lok Sabha, Sitharaman asserted that no state was being denied money.

The Parliament Budget Session 2024 is currently underway. It commenced on July 22, 2024, and is scheduled to conclude on August 12, 2024.

She recalled that in the past Budgets by the UPA government also did not mention names of all states in their Budget speech.

“I have been picking up on Budget speeches since 2004-2005, 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and so on. The Budget of 2004-2005 did not take the name of 17 states. I would like to ask the members of the UPA government at that time – did money not go to those 17 states? Did they stop it?” Sitharaman said.

She was responding to comments by several opposition members that the Budget has provided funds only to Bihar and Andhra Pradesh and nothing to other states.

Sitharaman said India is the fastest-growing economy globally and has overcome the after-effects of the pandemic due to heavy capex push.

She also said the government is complying with the fiscal deficit trajectory. It will bring down the deficit to below 4.5 per cent by 2025-26 from the targeted 4.9 per cent for the current fiscal. The deficit was 5.6 per cent in 2023-24.

She said a misleading campaign is being promoted. “It pains me to know that they could say that you are not mentioned in the budget speech, you get nothing.”

“In a budget speech if a state’s name is not mentioned, this does not mean the state does not get anything,” FM clarified.

She also said that it is wrong to say only two states benefitted from the budget.

FY25 budget has not given lesser allocation to any sector compared to last year, she highlighted.

The budget aims to achieve Viksit Bharat’s vision by 2047, FM said.

The reply from the Finance Minister was addressing issues and concerns raised by opposition parties. Members of Parliament are discussing various issues, including the Union Budget, the economic situation, and other matters of national importance.

Opposition parties on Monday tore into the Union Budget saying most of the states have got nothing in the first major economic document of the Modi 3.0 government.

Treasury benches on the other hand lauded the Rs 48.2 lakh crore Union Budget presented in Parliament on July 23 saying the country has made all-round development.

Participating in the general discussion on the budget, senior BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi reeled out data on GDP growth, rising foreign exchange reserves, declining fiscal deficit and a sharp increase in foreign remittances to highlight the achievements of the government on the economic front.

Seeking to counter the charges levelled by opposition parties during the discussion regarding government favouring corporates, Trivedi said the corporate taxes have been reduced to make the industry competitive.

He pointed out that global MNCs are shifting away their base from China where corporate tax is 25 per cent.

The BJP leader also lauded the central government’s work on controlling inflation.

On the Congress party’s charge that no person belonging to SC, ST and OBC was present at the traditional ‘halwa ceremony’ held before the budget, he said, “Ye woh log pooch rahe hain, jo 60 saal se khate rahe halwa aur janta ko khilate rahe balua. (Such remarks are being made by those who keep relishing halwa for 60 years but gave nothing to the people)”.

Congress member Imran Pratapgarhi said the budget has done injustice to states, youth, farmers, women and the middle class.

He said the finance minister has spoken only 10 words on inflation at a time when tomato prices have skyrocketed to Rs 100 per kg.

Pratapgarhi described the budget as “jhoot ka pulinda” (pack of lies) and a compilation of Prime Minister’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’.

Congress MP Rajeev Shukla criticised the budget on several counts and made a strong case for a review of several provisions in the GST law to help the MSME sector.

He also said there is huge unemployment in the country and its impact was visible on the BJP’s Lok Sabha seas tally.

Shukla wondered how jobs will be generated when the capital expenditure has been reduced by Rs 1 lakh crore.",Left,Center-Right,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-union-budget-2024-25-discussion-reply-live-lok-sabha-8983838.html
news18.com,"'Taxes Like England, Services Like Somalia': AAP's Raghav Chadha Attacks Modi Govt's Budget 2024","Rajya Sabha MP Raghav Chadha on Thursday voiced strong criticism of the Union Budget 2024, presented by the NDA government in its third-consecutive term, and said, “India is paying taxes like England and receiving services like Somalia.”

During the general discussion on the Union Budget in the Rajya Sabha, he described the budget as disappointing, claiming it “failed to satisfy any section of society, including BJP supporters and voters.”

Chadha remarked, “Usually when a Union Budget is presented, some sections of society are happy while others are not. However, this time, the government has managed to displease everyone. Even BJP supporters are unhappy.”

Highlighting the burden of taxation, the AAP leader stated, “In the last 10 years, the government has been taking around 70-80 per cent of the public’s income through taxes such as Income Tax, GST, and Capital Gains Tax. What does the public get in return?”

He went on to question the quality of services provided by the government, saying, “We pay taxes like in England but receive services like in Somalia. What kind of world-class healthcare, transportation, and education is the government providing us?”

Commenting on the BJP’s performance in the recent Lok Sabha elections, the Rajya Sabha MP noted, “In 2019, the BJP government had 303 seats, but the people of the country imposed a GST of 18 per cent on those seats, bringing them down to 240.”

He attributed the BJP’s reduced seat count to economic issues, stating, “The primary reasons for this decline are economy, economy, and economy.”

Chadha pointed out that rural income growth is at a “decadal low” and that real rural wages have been “consistently declining” over the past 25 months. He also cited concerns about food inflation, unemployment, and per capita income.

Citing food inflation, unemployment and per capita income, among many others, as the reasons for the low number of seats, he sarcastically remarked that if these trends continue, the BJP could see an even more significant decline in seats, potentially falling to 120 seats in future elections.",Left,Left,https://www.news18.com/politics/taxes-like-england-services-like-somalia-aaps-raghav-chadha-attacks-modi-govts-budget-2024-8978736.html
news18.com,All Doubts Cleared: Govt Issues FAQs On Capital Gains Tax Rules Announced In Budget 2024,"The Union Budget 2024 has proposed simplifying the holding periods for capital gains by introducing only two durations: 12 months and 24 months, to determine short-term and long-term capital gains, respectively. Additionally, the tax rates have been streamlined and made uniform for most assets.

The indexation benefit has been removed in Budget 2024, while the exemption limit for Long-term Capital Gains (LTCG) on assets such as listed shares and mutual funds has been increased from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.25 lakh.

Holding period has been simplified. There are only two holding periods now, viz. 1 year and 2 year.

Rates have been rationalised and made uniform for majority of assets.

Indexation has been done away with for ease of computation with simultaneous reduction of rate from 20% to 12.5%.

Q3. How has the holding period been simplified?

Ans. Earlier there were three holding periods for considering an asset to be a long- term capital asset. Now the holding period has been simplified. There are only two holding periods,- for listed securities, it is one year, for all other assets, it is two years.

Q4. Who will benefit from the change in holding period?

Ans. The holding period of all listed assets will now be one year. Therefore, for listed units of business trusts (ReITs, InVITs) holding period is reduced from 36 months to 12 months. The holding period of gold, unlisted securities (other than unlisted shares) is also reduced from 36 months to 24 months.

Q5. What about the holding period of immovable property and unlisted shares?

Ans. The holding period of immovable property and unlisted shares remains the same as earlier i.e. 24 months.

Q6. Elaborate on the change in the rate structure for STT paid capital assets?

Ans. Rate for short-term STT paid listed equity, Equity oriented mutual fund and units of business trust (Section 111A) has increased from 15 to 20%. Similarly the rate for these assets for long-term (S. 112A) has increased from 10 to 12.5%.

Q10. Can the taxpayer continue to avail the roll over benefits on capital gains?

Ans. Yes. The roll over benefits remain the same as earlier. There is no change in roll over benefits already available under the IT Act. Therefore, taxpayers who want to save on LTCG tax even with low rates, can continue to avail the roll over benefits on fulfilment of conditions as applicable.

Q11. In which assets, can the long-term capital gains be invested for roll over benefits?

Ans. For roll over benefits, taxpayers can invest their gains in houses under section 54 or section 54F or in certain bonds under section 54EC. For complete details of all roll over benefits, please refer to section 54, 54B, 54D, 54EC 54F, 54G of the IT Act.

news18.com,Budget 2024: 10 Thriving Economies That Don't Levy Any Income Tax on Its Citizens,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has unveiled the Union Budget 2024, sparking widespread discussion on its economic implications. The budget discourse is the issue of taxation, with public clamour for relief through tax cuts and exemptions. However, there exist several nations globally where governments do not levy any income tax on their citizens, yet their economies flourish robustly. Here are details on 10 such nations showcasing remarkable economic resilience:

United Arab Emirates (UAE)

Leading nation is the United Arab Emirates (UAE), notable for its absence of personal taxation. Instead, the government sustains itself through indirect taxes such as VAT and various duties. Fueled by robust sectors like oil and tourism, the UAE boasts a formidable economy.

Bahrain

Similar to Dubai, the government of Bahrain does not impose income tax on its citizens. Instead, it relies on indirect taxes to fund its expenditures. This system has fostered rapid growth in small businesses and startups, contributing to the overall improvement of Bahrain’s economy.

Kuwait

Kuwait, a tax-free country, does not levy income tax on its residents. With its economy predominantly reliant on oil revenues, the government foregoes the need for collecting taxes from its populace.

Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia does not impose income tax or direct taxes on its citizens. The country’s economy maintains a robust pace supported by its indirect tax system.

Bahamas

The economy of the Bahamas thrives on tourism, with the country refraining from collecting income tax from its residents. Each year, tourists from around the globe visit this destination, significantly bolstering its economic stability.

Brunei

As a nation with substantial oil reserves, the government of Brunei sees no need to impose taxes on its citizens.

Cayman Islands

Situated in North America, the Cayman Islands sustains its economy primarily through tourism, attracting visitors for its scenic beauty and holiday destinations. The government refrains from levying income tax on its residents.

Oman

Similar to Bahrain and Kuwait, Oman does not impose taxes on its citizens. The country sustains a robust economy through the sale of oil and gas.

Qatar

Like its Gulf neighbours, Qatar relies heavily on revenues from the oil industry. As a result, income tax is not levied on its populace. Despite its size, Qatar is wealthy due to its oil resources.

Monaco

Located in Europe, Monaco is a small yet economically strong country. It generates revenue primarily from tourism, allowing it to abstain from taxing its residents.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-despite-being-tax-free-economy-thrives-in-these-10-nations-8978724.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024: How Indexation Changes Bring Relief For Gold ETFs, FoFs, International Funds","The Union Budget 2024 has introduced changes to how capital gains on gold are taxed. Gold and silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs), equity and hybrid fund of funds (FoFs) and international schemes will again qualify for long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax benefits.

The holding period for investing in gold as long term capital gains has been brought down from 36 months to 24 months. Further, the benefit of indexation for LTCG calculation on gold has been removed.

What Did The Budget Say About Indexation?

According to Budget documents, mutual fund (MF) offerings, other than those that are equity or debt-oriented, will now qualify for long-term capital gains taxation of 12.5 per cent if held for over 24 months. At present, gold and silver ETFs and index funds, equity-oriented or hybrid fund of funds (FoFs) and international schemes are taxed at the investors’ income tax slab rate.

The change is likely to become effective on redemptions post April 1, 2026. According to MF officials, these offerings had unintentionally got classified as debt funds last year and this budget makes a course correction.

What Does This Mean?

Investors in mutual fund plans that allocate 35-65 per cent to equity, with the balance in debt, equity, or a mix of the two, will not get indexation benefits if they hold these instruments for three years or more after Tuesday’s budget announcements.

The new rules for capital gains on gold are applicable from July 23, 2024.

Previous rules

Under the previous rules, indexation i.e. adjustment of inflation price was allowed while calculating long term capital gains on the sale of gold or gold jewellery.

Indexation allowed for the reduction of taxable capital gains by increasing the cost of acquisition price as per an index that tracks changes in inflation.

Before the changes made by the Union Budget, you had to own gold for 36 months before capital gains on it’s sale would count as long-term and would get taxed at 20 per cent.

In 2023, the government had said that any MF scheme which invests less than 35 per cent of its corpus in domestic equities will no longer enjoy indexation benefits. The tax on such schemes was brought at par with bank deposits, which is the individual slab rate.

The tax change was primarily targeted at debt MF schemes, however, all MF offerings with less than 35 per cent exposure to domestic equities ended up losing the tax benefits.

Implications of the New Rules

These amendments simplify the taxation process for gold investors by reducing the holding period and tax rate for long-term capital gains while removing the complex indexation calculation.

Investors must now weigh the benefits of a lower tax rate against the removal of indexation when considering the sale of their gold assets.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/tax/budget-2024-indexation-changes-gold-etfs-fofs-international-funds-8976550.html
news18.com,"In Budget 2024, Nirmala Sitharaman Lists 9 Priorities, 4 Pillars of Modi Sarkar","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday announced the Narendra Modi government’s nine priorities and four pillars to take the country forward as she presented the Union Budget for the year 2024-2025.

Sitharaman said the government will make sustained efforts on nine priorities for ‘Viksit Bharat’, listing them as productivity and resilience in agriculture, employment and skilling, improved human resources, social justice, manufacturing and services, urban development, energy security, infrastructure, innovation, research and development, and next-gen reforms.

“As mentioned in the interim Budget, we need to focus on four different sections: the poor, women, youth and the farmers,” the minister said as she presented her seventh budget.

Introducing the prime minister’s package of five schemes and initiatives to facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth over five years with a central outlay of Rs 2 lakh crore, Sitharaman said: “This year, we have made a provision of Rs 1.48 lakh crore for education, employment and skilling.”

She added that the government has extended the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana for five years, which is benefiting 80 crore people of the country.

The finance minister said people have given a unique opportunity to the Modi government to take India on the path of strong development, and all-round prosperity.

In the next two years, one crore farmers will be initiated in natural farming, she said. Large-scale vegetable production clusters would be promoted to increase output, she stated.

The government will release new 109 high-yielding, climate-resilient seeds for 32 field and horticulture crops.

According to her, implementation of various schemes announced in the interim budget in February is still underway.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said the government will come out with a credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs to facilitate term loans without collateral or third party guarantee. She proposed central assistance of Rs 2.2 lakh crore for urban housing over the next five years.

As part of a slew of measures to boost the sector, the government will reduce the turnover threshold of MSME buyers for mandatory onboarding on TReDs platform from Rs 500 crore to Rs 250 crore.

news18.com,"LTCG, STCG Raised: Capital Gains Get Taxing in Budget 2024, Market Reacts With Losses","Union Budget 2024: Retail investors could be hit hard, as the long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) on all financial assets, including equity, has been hiked to 12.5 per cent from 10 per cent with immidiate effect. Small traders would get a bigger hit, as the short-term capital gains tax has been raised to 20 per cent (with immediate effect) from 15 per cent earlier.

This will be effective from October 1. The only relief in the Budget 2024 was an increase the exemption limit of capital gains on financial assets to Rs 1.25 lakh from Rs 1 lakh earlier.

Long-Term Capital Gains: The tax rate on long-term capital gains for all financial and non-financial assets will rise from 10% to 12.5%. Additionally, the exemption limit for these gains has been set at Rs 1.25 lakh per year.

Short-Term Capital Gains: The tax rate on short-term gains from certain financial assets will increase from 15% to 20%.

The equity benchmark indices went into a freefall mode as the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a hike in long term capital gains tax.

Presenting the budget, Sitharaman emphasized India’s robust economic growth amidst global uncertainties. “India’s economic growth continues to be the shining exception and will remain so in the years ahead,” she stated. She also noted that while the global economy is performing better than expected, it faces significant policy uncertainties, with downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation.

The FM listed Nine priorities for this year and coming years. These include Productivity and resilience in Agriculture, Employment and skilling, Inclusive HRD and social justice, Manufacturing and services, Urban development, Energy security, Infra, Innovation and R&D; and Next generation reforms. This focusses on job creation and boosting consumption, potentially benefiting consumer goods, real estate, and auto sectors.

What are the current tax rules for LTCG, STCG?

As per income tax rules, when an individual sells a capital asset, he/she can earn capital gains or losses. These capital gains or losses are categorised as short term or long-term depending on the nature of the capital asset and the period of holding specified for the asset for the purpose of this categorisation.

For instance, if the equity shares listed on a stock exchange are sold before 12 months are completed from date of purchase, then capital gains or loss will be categorised as short-term. If the listed equity shares are sold after completion of 12 months, then capital gains or loss will be categorised as long term. On the other hand, for unlisted equity shares, if sold before 24 months, the gains or loss will be called short term. If the unlisted equity shares are sold after 24 months, then gains.

Long-term capital gains, long term capital losses, short-term capital gains, and short term capital losses are abbreviated as LTCG, LTCL, STCG and STCL respectively.

Experts Talk

Shlok Srivastav, Cofounder & COO, Appreciate, “In all fairness, markets and the business ecosystem were anticipating some bid at “rationalisation” of the long term and short-term capital gains tax rates. The drastic revision of STCG from 15 per cent to 20 per cent makes sense given that there have been renewed murmurs vis-a-vis the overheating of the derivatives market. The recent statement by the market regulator that the growth in trading volume has now leapfrogged to a macro level concern from being a micro-one was a big hint that the government was actively looking to temper and moderate the action in the derivatives segment. Having said that, one must tip their hat to the government for killing two birds with one stone with the revision in LTCG. For serious long-term investors, the increase from 10% to 12.5% would hardly make a dent in the larger accounting of gains. At the same time, it will nudge investors into entering Indian markets with a reasonably long-term outlook and encourage them to step up as actual stakeholders in the Indian growth story. Sure, the LTCG hike would be a market sentiment dampener for some time but as we know from hindsight, capital market players are going to take this move into stride and move on.”

Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, said: “The increase in long term capital gain will have a negative while the intent to reduce the euphoria in the market is right. But we believe increasing the long term capital gain by 25% to 12.5% will lead to investments move towards unproductive assets like gold and real estate. For a growing economy like India increasing penetration of capital markets is critical and this measure will reduce the acceleration seen in this direction over last few years.”

On capital gains tax in new tax regime, Rajarshi Dasgupta, Executive Director, AQUILAW says “The Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax will rise from 10% to 12.5%, and the Short Term Capital Gains (STCG) tax on certain assets will increase from 15% to 20%. Short term gains on certain financial assets shall henceforth attract a tax rate of 20%, while that on all other financial assets and all non-financial assets shall continue to attract the applicable tax rate. The limit of exemption of capital gains on certain financial assets has been increased to Rs 1.25 lakh per year. In addition, Sitharaman also announced a hike in STT (securities transaction tax) on F&O (futures and options) securities by 0.02% and 0.1% in order to discourage retail investors from trading in the risky market segment.

The widening gap between STCG and LTCG rates is a clear incentive for longer-term holdings, which aligns with our view of creating sustainable wealth. This move is also a step towards standardising taxation across various asset classes, potentially simplifying the investment decision-making process for many.”",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/tax/ltcg-stcg-raised-capital-gains-get-taxing-in-budget-2024-market-reacts-with-losses-8975567.html

Sitharaman presented the Budget for 2024-25, her seventh straight presentation, surpassing the record of former prime minister Morarji Desai. This was the first Budget of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government’s third term in office.

In her Budget speech, Sitharaman announced that the government will launch three employment-linked schemes. These schemes will be based on enrolment in the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO), Sitharaman said in the Lok Sabha.

The first Congress reaction to the Budget came from Jairam Ramesh who credited Rahul Gandhi with bringing the unemployment crisis to national focus during the general elections.

Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said: “After ten years of denial — where neither the non-biological PM nor his party’s Lok Sabha Elections Manifesto would even mention jobs — the Union Government seems to have finally come around to tacitly admitting that mass unemployment is a national crisis that requires urgent attention.”

Ramesh alleged that the budget announcement on facilitating internships was “clearly modelled” on Congress’s Nyay Patra 2024. As per Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement, the scheme would provide internship in top 500 companies to 1 crore youth in five years. Interns will be given Rs 5,000 per month along with one time assistance of Rs 6,000.

“The Finance Minister has taken a leaf out of the INC’s Nyay Patra 2024, with its internship program clearly modelled on the INC’s proposed Apprenticeship Program that was called Pehli Naukri Pakki. However, in their trademark style, the scheme has been designed to grab headlines, with arbitrary targets…”

Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram also took a swipe at the government over the Union Budget, saying he is glad that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman read the Congress 2024 manifesto after the Lok Sabha poll results.

In a post on X, Chidambaram said: “I am glad to know that the Hon’ble FM has read the Congress Manifesto LS 2024 after the election results. I am happy she has virtually adopted the Employment-linked incentive (ELI) outlined on page 30 of the Congress Manifesto.”

“I am also happy that she has introduced the Apprenticeship scheme along with an allowance to every apprentice spelt out on page 11 of the Congress Manifesto. I wish the FM had copied some other ideas in the Congress Manifesto. I shall shortly list the missed opportunities,” the former finance minister said.

The move to claim credit for the internship scheme is also in keeping with the Congress’s attempts to woo the student community disillusioned by paper leaks and the NEET controversies. Rahul Gandhi, during his campaign rallies, had widely talked about the Congress’s promise to give Rs 1 lakh apprenticeship stipend for diploma holders below the age of 25 years. The central government scheme, however, does not put forth any such condition.

The Congress also claimed that much of the budget provisions have been picked up from the Congress manifesto, citing the employment-linked incentive as an example.

With the unemployment crisis being counted as a major factor in the BJP’s diminished performance in the Lok Sabha elections, it does not come as a surprise that job generation is the big focus in the Union Budget 2024.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also said the government plans to raise capital gains exemption limit on certain financial assets to Rs 1.25 lakh per year for middle and upper middle class.

Presenting the Budget for 2024-25, she announced a hike in STT (securities transaction tax) on F&O (futures and options) securities by 0.02% and 0.1%. Income receipt on share buyback will be taxed in the hands of recipients, Sitharaman added.

The Finance Minister further announced abolishing angel tax for all classes of investors in startups. “First of all, to bolster the Indian startup eco-system, boost the entrepreneurial spirit and support innovation, I propose to abolish the so-called angel tax for all classes of investors,” she said.

The removal of the angel tax is expected to be a boost for startups as it will help in promoting a more conducive environment for them.

news18.com,"Budget 2024: FM Nirmala Sitharaman, Draped in White & Magenta Silk Saree, Poses With Tablet in Red Sleeve","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday posed with a tablet in a red sleeve ahead of presenting the Union Budget 2024-25 to Parliament, keeping up the tradition of ditching the traditional briefcase for ‘bahi-khata’ and ultimately a paperless document stored digitally.

Draped in a white silk saree with magenta border, the finance minister posed for the traditional ‘briefcase’ picture outside her office, along with her team of officials, before heading to meet the President.

With the tablet carefully kept inside the red cover with a golden-coloured national emblem embossed on it, Parliament will be Sitharaman’s next destination after the call on President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhawan.

Sitharaman, India’s first full-time woman finance minister, had in July 2019 ditched the colonial legacy of a Budget briefcase for the traditional ‘bahi-khata’ to carry Union Budget papers. She used the same in the following year, and in a pandemic-hit 2021, she swapped traditional papers with a digital tablet for carrying her speech and other Budget documents. That tradition continued on Tuesday.

Her Budget for the fiscal beginning April 2024 (FY2024-25) is the Modi government’s 13th straight Budget since 2014 (including two interim Budgets presented ahead of general elections in 2019 and 2024).

Sitharaman was appointed the finance minister when Narendra Modi swept to power again in the 2019 election and presented her maiden Budget on July 5, 2019. She used a red cloth folder enclosed with a string and emblazoned with the national emblem to carry Budget documents. In February this year, she presented another interim budget. The Budget for 2024-25 is Sitharaman’s seventh straight Budget, a record.

Before Sitharaman, a long-standing colonial tradition in connection with the Budget presentation was broken during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government when the then finance minister Yashwant Sinha presented the Budget at 11 am rather than at the traditional time of 5pm. Since then, all the governments have been presenting the Budget at 11am.

Soon after presenting her maiden Budget in 2019, Sitharaman had said that the bahi-khata was a break from the colonial legacy. “Why did I not use a leather bag to carry budget documents? I thought it is high time we move on from the British hangover, to do something on our own. And well, easier for me to carry too,” she had said.

SITHARAMAN’S SARTORIAL LEGACY

For her first Budget session, the finance minister chose a pink Mangalgiri silk saree with gold borders.

In 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Sitharaman wore a yellow silk saree with a blue border to make a symbolic statement. Yellow is considered an auspicious colour in Hindu culture that symbolises hope and prosperity — bringing optimism during the dark phase.

For Budget 2021, the FM wore a Pochampally silk saree from Telangana with an Ikat design, sending a message of support to local artisans and weavers.

In 2022, the finance minister further promoted regional craftsmanship and art by wearing a brown Bomkai saree with maroon and gold borders in a homage to Odisha’s handloom legacy.

It was Karnataka’s turn in 2023 as Sitharaman wore a vibrant red silk saree with black temple motif borders showcasing the Kasuti embroidery from the Dharwad region.

In February 2024, while presenting the Interim Budget, Nirmala Sitharaman opted for a blue-cream coloured tussar silk saree with kantha handiwork.

Positive For Banking And Financial Sector: Achala Jethmalani, Economist, RBL Bank On Budget 2024 “From a macroeconomic standpoint, the increased revenue receipts led fiscal consolidation augments well for the economy at large. The social sector spending and the focus on extending loans under several schemes implies increased financial intermediation. The land related reforms proposed in the budget if gets implemented would help facilitate credit flow and other agricultural services to the end-user. By imposing higher taxes on capital market related transactions could possibly act as a deterrent for short-term related activities and possibly lead to either consumption, or bring about a ‘nudge’ to move to traditional savings or shift to long term investment goals,” said Achala Jethmalani, Economist, RBL Bank. “With borrowing program lowered marginally and walking the fiscal consolidation glide path is encouraging from debt markets standpoint as it raises the prospects of softer bond yields. The healthy macro mix, the fiscal positioning and outlook raises prospects of an upgrade in India’s sovereign rating too; further auguring well for the debt market. The fiscal prudence will also help in appropriate monetary response with inflation seen easing. Thus, overall the budget to us appears to be a positive for the banking and financial sector,” Jethmalani added.

The plan to expand the country’s infrastructure investment will be enabled by the market based financing framework which will lead to expansion of credit and consequent growth in this key sector.” “Overall, these initiatives are geared to build a sustainable banking sector which will be the key support to the country’s overall growth strategy. The development of Financial Sector vision and strategy for the next five years will be eagerly awaited as the ecosystem participants will be able to have a clearer road map for overall growth as well for emerging areas like climate finance in line with the focus on sustainability.

news18.com,"‘Special Status’ Out, ‘Special Funds’ In: How Modi Govt Bypassed Big Hurdle in Budget 2024 to Help Bihar, Andhra","Amid rising demand and political clamour for ‘special status’ to Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, the Narendra Modi government on Tuesday generously opened its purse strings in the states ruled by allies JD(U) and TDP while deftly sidestepping the contentious issue over the nomenclature of the financial aid.

In her Union Budget speech 2024, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman allocated special financial assistance to both states, effectively appeasing and pleasing two key allies – Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu — without granting formal ‘special status’ to either. This strategic move ensures continued political support from these influential regional leaders while addressing the development needs of their states, said senior politicians of the BJP.

Effectively, Bihar will be getting Rs 37,500 crore in special funds allocated for multiple infrastructure projects across districts and flood mitigation plan, while there will be additional funds for the development of tourism and cultural circuit around Rajgir and Nalanda in the state.

The Centre will be releasing Rs 15,000 crore in the current financial year as special assistance for the industrial and infrastructural development of Amaravati, the new capital of Andhra Pradesh. Apart from this specific fund, the central government will also release additional financial assistance through multilateral development agencies.

Bypassing ‘Special Status’, Allocating ‘Special Funds’

Modi’s team of economists and the Finance Ministry have managed to navigate the complexities and complications of granting special status to states, an issue that has historically sparked significant debate and questioned the federal structure.

By bypassing these complications, limiting the controversies and instead providing special financial assistance, the Finance Minister has addressed regional development needs while maintaining political harmony, ensuring continued support and safeguarding the federal balance.

The Finance Ministry has worked around the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act to allocate special funds to the state, while emphasizing on the NITI Aayog report about Bihar’s infrastructural needs.

Amravati in ‘Amrit Kaal’

Under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, that was introduced in 2014, the Modi government has now recognised Amravati as the capital of Andhra Pradesh. The act formally bifurcated Andhra Pradesh into two states — Telangana and the residuary Andhra Pradesh — effective from June 2, 2014.

Hyderabad was then designated as the shared capital for both states for a period of up to 10 years. During this period, Andhra Pradesh would develop its own capital, which later became Amaravati. In 2024, the government finally and formally identified Amravati as the state capital.

A senior politician of the TDP told News18: “We will build Amravati in ‘Amrit Kaal’. We will make it one of the best state capitals in the country. We are grateful to the Modi government for supporting us in realising our dream.”

Big Boost for Bihar

For Bihar, the Centre has allocated Rs 37,500 crore, surpassing the funds announced for Andhra Pradesh. This includes special allocations for infrastructure projects, flood mitigation, and tourism-cultural circuit developments in Rajgir and Nalanda.

The multiple infrastructure projects for Bihar include the Buxar-Bhagalpur road, the Patna-Purnea Expressway, a two-lane bridge over the Ganga at Buxar, and improved road connectivity for Bodh Gaya, Rajgir, Darbhanga, and Vaishali. A special allocation of Rs 26,000 crore has been designated for these developments. Apart from this, the Centre has also announced Rs 11,500 crore as flood mitigation funds for Bihar.

Why No ‘Special Status’ to States?

Over the past decades, several states have been granted special status at various times, primarily due to their unique socio-economic and geographic challenges. The states include Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeastern states (Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh) under Article 370 and Article 371, respectively.

Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have also been granted special status for having difficult and diverse interior terrain. The government keeps reviewing such status over time. The special status of J&K now ceases to exist post abrogation of Article 370. Under special status, the states generally receive funding and tax incentives.

The special status for states has been a debated topic due to several reasons, and a senior economist said that with special status, some states receive preferential treatment in the form of financial assistance and tax incentives. This can create disparities among states, leading to debates about fairness and equality. It also carries huge political ramifications.

“Granting special status often involves political considerations, with parties using it as a tool to gain support in certain regions. This can lead to accusations of favoritism and political maneuvering. The government has diligently tried to move away from the politics of granting special status,” said a senior economist who has worked in PM Modi’s core team.

On Monday, Finance MoS Pankaj Chaudhury, while replying to a question on special status in Parliament, stated: “The Special Category Status for plan assistance was granted in the past by the National Development Council (NDC) to some states that were characterized by a number of features necessitating special consideration. These features included:

Hilly and difficult terrain

Low population density and/or sizable share of tribal population

Strategic location along borders with neighboring countries

Economic and infrastructural backwardness

Non-viable nature of state finances

The decision was taken based on an integrated consideration of all the factors listed above and the peculiar situation of the state.

“Earlier, the request of Bihar for Special Category Status was considered by an Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG) which submitted its Report on March 30, 2012. The IMG came to the conclusion that based on existing NDC criteria, the case for Special Category Status for Bihar is not made out,” he added.

news18.com,Union Budget 2024: Why Has FM Announced Cut In Customs Duty On These Items? What Is Cheaper Now?,"The Union Budget 2024-25 has promised significant changes across various sectors, with key announcements including substantial reduction in custom duties on cancer medicines, mobile phones, silver, gold, leather goods and seafood.

“The government will exempt three more cancer treatment drugs from customs duties. We are also reducing the basic customs duty on mobile phones, chargers, and other mobile components,” Sitharaman stated during her Budget 2024 presentation in Parliament on Tuesday.

The reduction in customs duties on gold and silver to 6% is expected to boost retail demand and help mitigate smuggling issues in the world’s second-largest bullion consumer. However, increased gold demand could impact India’s trade deficit and place additional pressure on the rupee.

Let’s look at what will become cheaper

Mobile Phones: The FM has announced reduction in the basic customs duty on mobile phones and chargers to 15%. “With a three-fold increase in domestic production and almost a 100-fold jump in the export of mobile phones in the last six years, the Indian mobile industry has matured. In the interest of consumers, I now propose to reduce the basic customs duty (BCD) on mobile phones, mobile PCBA, and mobile chargers to 15%,” she said in her speech.

Gold, Silver and Platinum: The budget proposes to cut customs duty to 6% on gold and silver. It also promises to cut customs duty on platinum to 6.4%. “To enhance domestic value addition in gold and precious metal jewellery in the country, I propose to reduce customs duties on gold and silver to 6 per cent and that on platinum to 6.4%,” said the finance minister in the Budget 2024 speech.

Cancer Drugs: Three cancer drugs — Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, Osimertinib, and Durvalumab — will be exempt from customs duties to provide relief to patients. Trastuzumab Deruxtecan is used for certain types of breast cancer and works by delivering chemotherapy directly to cancer cells. Osimertinib is used for a type of lung cancer with specific gene mutations and helps stop the growth of cancer cells. Durvalumab is an immunotherapy drug used for lung and bladder cancers, helping the immune system attack cancer cells. The National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) highlights the overall cancer burden in India, indicating that approximately 1 in 9 people will develop cancer in their lifetime. Health experts have said that the move is expected to make the drugs more affordable for cancer patients.

Seafood: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government will provide finance for shrimp farming and marketing while presenting the Union Budget 2024-25. She said the government has reduced the basic customs duty on shrimp to 5%.

Solar Energy Parts: The government has proposed expanding the list of exempted capital goods for manufacturing solar cells and panels, boosting the renewable energy sector.

Critical Minerals: The finance minister announced a full exemption of customs duties on 25 critical minerals, including lithium, copper, cobalt, and rare earth elements, crucial for sectors like renewable energy and high-tech electronics. Basic customs duty on two of these minerals will also be reduced. Basic customs duties on these materials will be removed, aiding the manufacturing sector.

Footwear: Customs duties on leather and footwear manufacturing will be reduced.

Why Customs Duty Has Been Reduced

Customs duty on gold and silver has been reduced to 6% which may lead to a decline in domestic prices and perhaps lift demand. The existing duty on gold and silver is 15% which comprises 10% of basic customs duty and 5% as Agricultural Infrastructure Development cess. Gold prices on the MCX hovered at Rs 72,838 per 10 grams on Tuesday, hitting an intraday low of Rs 68,500.

The exemption of custom duty on cancer drugs has been done to bring down the cost of cancer treatment in India. The Union minister also brought down the customs duty on X-ray tubes used in medical X-ray machines. The current duty of 15% will be reduced to 5% until March 31, 2025. Thereafter, the duty will increase to 7.5% from April 1, 2025, to March 31, 2026, and then revert to 10% from April 1, 2026.

The decrease in basic customs duty on mobile phones would give a boost to the domestic production. Smartphone manufacturing is a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitions to boost the Indian economy and create jobs by attracting companies such as Apple, Foxconn and Samsung to India, the world’s second-largest mobile market where production grew 16% year-on-year to $44 billion last year.

In the beginning of her budget speech, the finance minister said the people of country have reposed their faith in the Modi government and re-elected it for a historic third term under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“We are grateful for their support, faith and trust in our policies. We are determined to ensure that all Indians, regardless of religion, caste, gender and age, make substantial progress in realising their life goals and aspirations,” she said.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/union-budget-2024-why-has-fm-announced-cut-in-customs-duty-on-these-items-what-is-cheaper-now-8975619.html
news18.com,"Union Budget 2024: At Rs 11.11 Lakh Crore, No Change from Interim Budget in Outlay for Infra","Similar to what was proposed in the interim budget earlier this year, the Union Budget 2024-25 has allocated Rs 11,11,111 crore for the capital expenditure outlay. The allocation for three major ministries — Defence (Rs 6.21 lakh crore), Road Transport and Highway (Rs 2.78 lakh crore), and Railways (Rs 2.55 lakh crore) remains unchanged too.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday said that the outlay for 2024 is 3.4% of the GDP. “This year, I have provided Rs 11,11,111 crore for capital expenditure. This would be 3.4% of our GDP,” she said.

She did not announce any new projects under Railways, but mentioned two new expressways for Bihar — Patna-Purnia and Buxar-Bhagalpur expressways. The minister said a total of Rs 26,000 crore is allocated for roads in Bihar, including a new bridge on River Ganga in Buxar.

Out of the Rs 2.78 lakh crore allocated to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), Rs 2.72 lakh crore is capital expenditure and Rs 5,758 crore is from revenue. Similarly, out of the Rs 2.55 lakh crore for Railways Ministry, Rs 2.52 lakh crore is from capital and Rs 3,393 crore from revenue.

“The total net allocation for the demand in BE 2024-25 is Rs 2,84,000 crore (Rs 2,78,000 crore plus Rs 6,000 crore). The additional Rs 6,000 crore in BE 2024-25 is to be met from the balances from Central Road and Infrastructure Fund for financing the road works,” the budget document read.

Around Rs 40 crore, from the Nirbhaya Fund, is earmarked for the safety of women on public road transport. The National Highways Authority of India has been granted Rs 1.68 lakh crore.

For Railways, reimbursement of losses on operation of strategic lines has been kept at Rs 2,648 crore in Budget Estimate 2024-25 as against Rs 2,491.84 crore in RE 2023-24. An amount of Rs 745 crore has been provided in BE 2024-25 towards debt servicing of market borrowings for national projects, the documents added.

“The total outlay provided for Capital Expenditure in Budget Estimate 2024-25 of Rs 2,65,200 crore includes Rs 2,52,000 crore from General Revenues, Rs 200 crore from Nirbhaya Fund Rs 3,000 crore from Internal Resource and Rs 10,000 crore from Extra Budgetary Resources. Total Receipt of Railways comprising revenues from passenger, goods, other coaching, sundry other heads and Railway Recruitment Boards etc. have been placed at Rs 2,78,500 crore in BE 2024-25…,” it added.

Sitharaman while speaking about the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, promised essential infrastructure such as water, power, railways and roads in Kopparthy node on the Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor and Orvakal node on Hyderabad-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor.

In 2023, when the Finance Minister presented the Union Budget for 2023-24, the capital expenditure (capex) target was increased by 33% to Rs 10 lakh crore, that was 3.3% of the GDP. Before that, in 2022, the Finance Minister raised capital expenditure by 35.4% for the financial year 2022-23 to Rs 7.5 lakh crore.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/union-budget-2024-at-rs-11-11-lakh-crore-no-change-from-interim-budget-in-outlay-for-infra-8975717.html
news18.com,Real Estate: Budget 2024 May Reduce Holding Period for LTCG Tax to 12 Months,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is just about to present her seventh Budget 2024-25 in about an hour. According to reports, the government is likely to reduce the real estate holding period for long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax to 12 months, against 24 months currently. This will bring real estate investments on par with mutual funds and equities.

The reports said the tax rates will, however, remain unchanged.

Currently, long-term capital gains are applicable if an investor holds real estate for over 24 months. The holding period for mutual funds (MFs) and equities is over 12 months, while that for gold and debt funds is over 36 months. Any investment below this period attracts short-term capital gains (STCG) tax.

STCG on real estate and gold/debt funds is as per the slab rate of the investor, while that on listed equities and MFs is 15 per cent. LTCG on real estate and gold/debt funds is 20 per cent with indexation benefit; while that on equities and MFs is 10 per cent (up to Rs 1 lakh LTGC is exempt).

The Centre may take up a more detailed capital gains tax regime restructuring later after a wider discussion and consultations, said said reports citing sources.

The markets are keenly watching any change in the long-term capital gains tax.

“Markets would be keenly awaiting any adverse changes in the capital gain tax on equities. In case there is no change in capital gain tax it would be considered positive for Indian equity markets,” according to JM Financial Services Research.

news18.com,"How Startups, Economists, Industrialists React to Budget 2024 Announcements?","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday announced the Union Budget 2024-25. The latest Budget has been welcomed across the board. Experts said the Budget will benefit the working class, women, entrepreneurs and MSMEs, while maintaining the fiscal prudence. However, the Budget raised capital gains tax, which disappointed the markets.

Customs Duty Announcements

Dharmesh Panchal, partner at Price Waterhouse & Co LLP, said, “The finance minister reiterated the commitment to rationalise GST rates and extend GST to other sectors. A comprehensive review of the customs duty rate structure over the next six months is in line with the Make in India strategy. It needs to be seen whether a road map for transition is provided to the domestic industry.”

Gold, Silver Import Duty Cut

The government has cut import duty on gold and silver to 6 per cent, from 15 per cent earlier.

Geetika Shrivastava, executive partner at Tattvam Group, said, “This will boost Indian gems and jewellery sector contributing in economic growth.”

Bhavik Patel, senior commodities analyst, Tradebulls Securities said, “The outlook of Gold looks strong despite import duty cut to 6 per cent as with duty cut, it will make gold cheaper domestically which will increase the demand for physical gold.”

The immediate outlook for gold will primarily depend on path of US dollar and US interest rate. Market has already priced in September’s rate cut and once Fed starts on the path of cutting rates, both gold and silver have no other way but only to go up, added Patel.

Skills, Capex, Fiscal Deficit Announcements

Abheek Barua, chief economist and executive vice-president at HDFC Bank, said, “The central focus of this budget has been on employment and associated issues like skill formation. The government’s efforts to reap India’s demographic dividend is visible in its push towards labour intensive production, its skilling initiative, incentivising formal job creation and increasing participation of women in the workforce. The budget estimate that these measures will help create 8 million jobs per year — which is line with the employment requirement that has been set out in the economic survey.”

The government made no compromise on its capex plans despite the increased allocation to some of its allies. The commitment towards fiscal consolidation with a reduction in the fiscal deficit to 4.9 per cent of GDP in FY25 is a positive for medium-term debt sustainability, he added.

Capital Gains Tax

Shravan Shetty, managing director at Primus Partners, said, “The increase in long-term capital gain will have a negative while the intent to reduce the euphoria in the market is right. But we believe increasing the long term capital gain by 25% to 12.5% will lead to investments move towards unproductive assets like gold and real estate. For a growing economy like India increasing penetration of capital markets is critical and this measure will reduce the acceleration seen in this direction over last few years.”

Startups

Mahankali Srinivas Rao, CEO of T-Hub, said, “The Budget 2024 marks a significant milestone for the Indian startup ecosystem, with initiatives that will undeniably foster innovation and growth. The abolition of the angel tax for all classes of investors is a pivotal move that will create a more supportive environment for angel investments, ultimately benefiting startups and paving the way for India to become a global innovation hub. The establishment of a Rs 1,000 crore venture capital fund dedicated to boosting the space sector is another forward-thinking initiative. This substantial investment will propel growth in the space economy by supporting innovative startups and groundbreaking research, positioning India at the forefront of space technology and exploration.”

Moreover, the introduction of the Anusandhan National Research Fund and a financing pool of Rs 1 lakh crore to spur private sector-driven research and innovation is a game-changer. This fund will power basic research and prototype development, driving commercial-scale innovation and enabling startups to bring cutting-edge solutions to the market, he added.

Real Estate

Pradeep Aggarwal, founder & chairman of Signature Global (India), said, “This Budget can be termed as prudent and holistic in each aspect

the government’s decision to allocate Rs 10 lakh crore under the PMAY Urban Scheme, targeting 3 crore houses and key focus on rationalising stamp duty for Home byers especially for women, underscores a robust vision for urban development and will help homebuyers would save the significant amounts, making home ownership more accessible.”

At macro level sustained infrastructure impetus, reflected in the Rs 11.11 lakh crore Capex allocation, we anticipate all these would create a multiplier impact and significant boost in the overall housing sector, he added.

“Additionally, a focus on rental housing in industrial parks via the PPP model, digitizing land records in cities will greatly improve transparency and ease property transactions,” Aggarwal added.

Aditya Kushwaha, CEO and director of Axis Ecorp, said, “We welcome the progressive, forward-thinking and comprehensive Budget 2024. The allocation of ₹11.11 lakh crore for capital expenditure, representing 3.4% of India’s GDP, clearly reflects the government’s robust commitment to infrastructure enhancement. The focus on the PM Awas Yojana-Urban, with a substantial ₹10 lakh crore earmarked to meet the housing needs of one crore poor and middle-class families, is particularly praiseworthy. Govt’s move to encouraging states to moderate high stamp duty rates will make housing more accessible and affordable. By simplifying the FDI norms, govt has given a window to promote the use of the Rupee for overseas investments. These comprehensive measures will invigorate the real estate sector, drive demand, and foster a more resilient economic environment.”

MSMEs

Rahul Garg, CEO & founder of Moglix, said, “MSMEs will benefit significantly from the credit guarantee scheme, new assessment models by PSU banks, and increased Mudra loan limits. The substantial allocation of ₹11 lakh crore for infrastructure especially nature resilient is crucial for building a Viksit Bharat. The strategic shift towards nuclear energy as a major power source is visionary. Finally, the emphasis on cultural heritage through the development of the Vishnupad, Mahabodhi temple corridors, Rajgir, and Nalanda is a welcome addition.”

Fiscal Prudence

Ranen Banerjee, partner and leader economic advisory, PwC India, said, “Fiscal prudence is the highlight of the full Union Budget 2024-25. The government has gone with realistic projections on its revenue and expenditure estimates and refrained from announcing overly populist measures. The majority of the allocations, including the capex allocation, are as outlined in the interim budget, thus providing continuity. The capex being kept at Rs 11.11 lakh crore was expected, given that the ability to consume this allocation is limited due to disruption from the elections in the first quarter and the second quarter being typically slowed down by the monsoons. The urgency around skilling requirements has been rightly reflected through announcements related to skilling loans, interest subvention on higher education loans and incentives to corporates for providing internship opportunities.”

The budget has also announced a focus on ‘Purvodaya’ or development of the eastern states, which is an imperative given that incomes and opportunities have been lagging in many of these states. This will provide a fillip to these states to bridge the income gap with other states while also helping to achieve the goal of inclusive development, he added.

Infra, Housing, Natural Farming

Jaxay Shah, chairperson of the Quality Council of India and founder & CMD of Savvy Group of Companies, said, “The Viksit Bharat budget exemplifies the confidence the NDA government has in its policies and partnerships. It stands as a testament to the strength of India’s federal structure, with the central government extending crucial support to states, especially in critical areas such as agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, and disaster management. The emphasis on natural farming, MSME growth, housing, and skilling underscores the government’s commitment to employment generation, economic progress, and sectoral enhancement. In terms of fiscal policy, the budget presents a forward-looking vision with its controlled fiscal deficit and a robust roadmap for future consolidation.”

The reduction in LTCG on real estate from 20% to 12.5% is set to promote further formalization in the sector, reduce corruption, and encourage investment. Collectively, these measures reflect a comprehensive approach to strengthening the economy and fostering sustainable, quality-driven development. I am excited about the role QCI will play in achieving the goals outlined in this budget, he added.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/how-startups-economists-industrialists-react-to-budget-2024-announcements-8975636.html
news18.com,Budget 2024: Good News for Start-Ups as Nirmala Sitharaman Scraps Angel Tax. Here's What It Means,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday brought cheer for start-ups as she abolished angel tax in the Union Budget 2024-25 for all classes of investors.

She also said that the corporate tax rate on foreign companies will be reduced to 35 per cent.

WHAT IS ANGEL TAX?

Angel Tax is used to refer to the income tax payable on the capital raised by unlisted companies via the issue of shares through off-market transactions.

Under Section 56(2) VII B of the Income Tax Act, the premium received on the sale of shares to a foreign investor is considered “income from other sources” and therefore, taxed accordingly.

It was in 2012 that the tax was first introduced by then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee under the UPA-II regime to check the laundering of funds.

In April 2018, the government issued a notification to give exemption to start-ups under Section 56 of the Income Tax Act in cases where the total investment including funding from angel investors did not exceed Rs 10 crore.

For the exemption, start-ups were also required to get approval from an inter-ministerial board and a certificate of valuation from a merchant banker, Economic Times reported.

When introduced, investments by a venture capital fund or company in a venture capital undertaking were kept outside the ambit of angel tax. Thereafter, the government provided relaxation to certain start-ups as recognised by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and having share capital (inclusive of share premium) lower than Rs 25 crore, pursuant to new issue.

In 2023, the government provided further relaxations to investors including government and government related investors, banks, entities in insurance business and certain categories of investors based in 21 jurisdictions as notified by it.

WHO DOES IT IMPACT?

Apart from start-ups, particularly those in early stages that rely heavily on external funding, the tax affects angel investors as the implications may make them more prudent about putting their money in start-ups.

WHY WAS THE INDUSTRY AGAINST IT?

For start-ups that are fledgling, the angel tax was an impediment as raising money often became an issue. The industry was also against angel tax as it was levied on any premium paid over the “fair market value” of shares, potentially leading to disagreements on valuation between startups and tax authorities.

INDUSTRY REACTION TO ANGEL TAX BEING ABOLISHED

Delphin Varghese, co-founder and Chief Revenue Officer, AdCounty Media, called the move a “big step in the journey of India’s growing startup ecosystem”.

“The tax issue has been a long-standing and vexing problem for early-stage investments since the year 2012, if not from time immemorial. The Angel Tax, levying up to 30.9% on investments far exceeding the fair market value, had stopped a lot of potential big investors. The decision could boost the funding of startups in their early stages, although, at this point in time, India already houses upwards of 84,000, with 107 of them having reached unicorn status, according to official records,” he said.

“Indian startups raised $42 billion in FY-2022 through 1,584 deals, a quantum which can potentially skyrocket if not hemmed in by this tax barrier. Lastly, abolishing the tax is expected to be in alignment with the spirit of the government’s Startup India initiative, which could give India better momentum in its journey toward becoming a $5 trillion economy by fostering both innovation and entrepreneurship in various sectors.”

Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director of Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited, said scrapping of the Angel Tax would infuse new confidence in India’s investor community. “Getting rid of this tax impediment should mean a pretty big trophy of risk taken out for investors in very early-stage companies, unlocking potentially billions in dormant capital. This number of active investors in India could now increase sharply, to 6,000-7,000.”

Meanwhile, Ridhima Kansal, director of Rosemoore, said start-ups were significant job creators and the big policy shift is likely to benefit emerging sectors like Deeptech, AI, and Clean Energy, amongst others, which take a large amount of capital at an early stage.

Raghunandan Saraf, Founder & CEO of Saraf Furniture, said the move would take India “towards positioning as a global hub for innovation”. “This would encourage a more risk capital–friendly milieu and, therefore, more likely home-grown global tech giants, besides reducing technology dependence and boosting economic sovereignty in the long run.”

Although the government has announced a number of reliefs for various sectors, it has made no compromise on its capex plans. Following the fiscal consolidation path, the government has reduced its FY25 fiscal deficit target to 4.9 per cent against 5.1 per cent fixed earlier, and pegged the deficit for FY26 at 4.5 per cent.

“It is a positive for medium-term debt sustainability,” said Abheek Barua, chief economist and executive vice-president at HDFC Bank.

Income Tax Relief

Presenting the Union Budget 2024-25, Sitharaman announced that the standard deduction in the new tax regime will be increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000.

The revised tax slabs are as follows: No tax up to Rs 3 lakh, Rs 3-7 lakh at 5 per cent, Rs 7-10 lakh at 10 per cent, Rs 10-12 lakh at 15 per cent, Rs 12-15 lakh at 20 per cent and above Rs 15 lakh at 30 per cent.

Salaried employees under new tax regime will save up to Rs 17,500 annually in taxes due to changes proposed in FY25 Budget, said the finance minister.

Apart from this, two tax incentive regimes for charity sector will be merged into one. Also, 58 per cent of corporate tax has come from simplified tax regime in FY23.

MSMEs, Startups Get A Support

The Finance Minister announced various measures to support micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), including a credit guarantee scheme for facilitating term loans to purchase machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee.

“We have formulated a package, covering financing, regulatory changes and technology support, for MSMEs to help them grow and also compete globally, as mentioned in the interim budget,” she said. Sitharaman also announced a new mechanism to facilitate the continuation of bank credit to MSMEs during their stress period.

The Finance Minister abolished angel tax on all classes of assets. Startup and venture funds cheered this Budget decision, terming it a “game-changer”.

Angel tax refers to the tax that the government imposes on funding raised by unlisted companies, or startups if their valuation exceeds the company’s fair market value.

Customs Duty Cut On Gold, Silver, Mobile Phones

Sitharaman reduced customs duty on a range of products, including gold, silver, critical minerals, mobile phones and other electronic items, to cut input costs, increase value addition, promote export competitiveness and boost domestic manufacturing.

The duty on shea nuts; marine sector goods such as prawn and shrimp feed, and fish feed; inputs for the manufacture of these feeds like lipid oil; cancer drugs; other precious metals like silver and platinum; textile, steel, copper, capital goods, shipping, medical equipment and leather sector items has also been reduced.

The basic customs duty on coins of precious metals, gold/silver findings, and gold and silver bars has been reduced to 6 per cent from 15 per cent. It has been cut to 5.35 per cent from 14.35 per cent for gold and silver dore.

On platinum, palladium, osmium, ruthenium and iridium, the levy has been cut to 6.4 per cent from 15.4 per cent.

Education, Employment

The finance minister has announced three schemes worth Rs 1.07 lakh crore to boost employment through retirement fund body EPFO for new entrants in the organised sector.

Scheme A: One-month wage will be provided to all persons newly entering the workforce in all formal sectors. The direct benefit transfer of one-month salary in three installments to first-time employees, as registered in the EPFO, will be up to Rs 15,000. The eligibility limit will be a salary of Rs 1 lakh per month. The scheme is expected to benefit 210 lakh youth.

Scheme B: It will incentivise additional employment in the manufacturing sector, linked to the employment of first-time employees. An incentive will be provided at a specified scale directly, both to the employee and the employer, with respect to their EPFO contribution in the first four years of employment. The scheme is expected to benefit 30 lakh youth entering employment, and their employers.

Scheme C: It will support employers and will cover additional employment in all sectors. All additional employment within a salary of Rs 1 lakh per month will be counted. The government will reimburse to employers up to Rs 3,000 per month for two years towards their EPFO contribution for each additional employee. The scheme is expected to incentivise additional employment of 50 lakh persons, she added.

On education, the government will provide financial support for loans up to Rs 10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions. Sitharaman said e-vouchers for this purpose will be given directly to one lakh students every year with interest subvention of 3 per cent of the loan amount.

Sops to Bihar, Andhra Pradesh

Sitharaman has made big announcements for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, the two states ruled by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) allies Janata Dal United (JDU) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP). It includes Rs 26,000 crore for highways and Rs 11,500 crore for flood mitigation for Bihar, and Rs 15,000 crore to develop the capital of Andhra Pradesh.

Other Key Announcements

Sitharaman announced a scheme to provide internship opportunities in 500 top companies to one crore youth in five years. An allowance of Rs 5,000 per month, along with a one-time assistance of Rs 6,000 through the CSR funds, will be provided.

Sitharaman said that states will be encouraged to bring down stamp duty. The Finance Minister also announced flood relief assistance for Assam, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

Summing up the Budget, Ranen Banerjee, partner and leader economic advisory, PwC India, said, “Fiscal prudence is the highlight of the full Union Budget 2024-25. The government has gone with realistic projections on its revenue and expenditure estimates and refrained from announcing overly populist measures. The majority of the allocations, including the capex allocation, are as outlined in the interim budget, thus providing continuity.”

The capex being kept at Rs 11.11 lakh crore was expected, given that the ability to consume this allocation is limited due to the disruption owing to the elections in the first quarter and the second quarter being typically slowed down by the monsoon. The urgency around skilling requirements has been rightly reflected through announcements related to skilling loans, interest subvention on higher education loans and incentives to corporates for providing internship opportunities, he added.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/from-income-tax-tweak-to-jobs-push-and-duty-cuts-on-gold-mobile-phones-top-points-from-budget-2024-25-8975751.html

The three schemes are part of the Prime Minister’s package, and will align with enrolment in the Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and focus on the recognition of first-time employees, as well as support to both employers and employees.

“They will gain exposure for 12 months to real-life business environment, varied professions and employment opportunities.

What are the Employment-Linked Incentive Schemes?

Scheme A for First Timers: The scheme will provide one-month wage payout to all those entering the workforce for the first time in all formal sectors.

news18.com,'Must Keep Tax Structure Simple to Expand Tax Base': Ex-NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar's Lowdown Ahead of Budget 2024,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to create history when she presents her seventh straight Budget on Tuesday for the fiscal 2024-25, surpassing the record of former prime minister Morarji Desai.

In the build-up to the Union Budget, economist and author Dr Rajiv Kumar, Chairman, Pahle India Foundation, and former Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog, shares his thoughts on taxation, reviving the rural economy and GST exemption in an interview with Sabyasachee Dash.

Edited Excerpts:

Considering your long association with a multilateral agency like the Asian Development Bank (ADB), it would be of interest to know your perspective on how international institutions view India’s prospects, especially in light of the reforms implemented over the past decade.

All multilateral agencies like the IMF, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank have retained their growth forecast for the Indian economy; some have even improved it. The general consensus seems to be that in 2024-2025, the economy will grow at 7 per cent, which will make India the fastest-growing large economy in the world. Moreover, my understanding is that India will contribute a substantial percentage to the overall growth of the world economy as a whole in the next decade. Now, this growth momentum that we are beginning to see, and I think which will be retained for the next decade, or even couple of decades or so, has been due to the reforms undertaken not just in the last 10 years by the Narendra Modi government, but the whole series of reforms that started in 1991 when I was in the Ministry of Finance working in the Department of Economic Affairs. The good thing has been that the direction of reforms has been consistent, though the pace has varied, which has created a strong expectation that the Indian economy will continue to see these structural reforms and therefore retain the growth momentum.

Where did the idea of the “100-Day” initiative originate? Do you think this timeframe is too short to effectively implement major programmes in a country as vast and complex as ours? I hope this initiative isn’t merely symbolic and perpetuating ad-hocism rather than addressing long-term issues.

The idea originated from the prime minister himself, and he had done this in 2019 too, when the new government was formed. I was then in the NITI Aayog. We also contributed to the programme. The 100-day timeframe is not meant to be the window for implementation. It is meant to indicate what all reforms and the steps that can be or rather should be undertaken at this time. Then ministries are given these go-aheads, which are to be implemented over a longer period. I don’t think it leads to a downturn, but my only issue is that very often, the 100-day programme starts and then pretty much remains on paper. It gets forgotten, except for a few which are directly supervised by the prime minister himself. This is the weakness that we have to address i.e. how to hold the ministries accountable to the plan of action or to the programme that they have outlined.

In my time at NITI Aayog, we had established a strong Development Monitoring and Evaluation office. The DMEP (DMEP) would ask for targets from the line ministries and then review and monitor them. Something like that ought to be done with the 100-day programme as well, otherwise it loses credibility and becomes a part of the rhetoric.

Generally, there’s an expectation that the government will stick to its projections for tax revenues and non-debt capital receipts, including asset monetisation, as outlined in the Interim Budget of February 2024. What are your thoughts on this?

The first part is true, which is that the government will adhere to the tax revenue projections. In fact, it may even improve them from the last interim projection because GST has shown greater buoyancy than in the past.

On the non-debt capital receipts, I’m afraid I’m quite disappointed. This non-debt capital receipts, the vast majority, come from the privatisation of public sector enterprises or asset monetisation. We had prepared a thorough list of potential candidates, all the values were given when I was in NITI, but I’ve seen in the last two or three years that the targets have been diluted. The momentum and the attention on the privatisation of public sector enterprises has shifted. There’s no talk now of privatisation of two public sector banks as there was earlier and the entire asset monetisation programme has been put on the back burner.

Now this, in my view, is something which is essential. It’s because the revenues from the non-debt capital receipts can be and should be used to reduce the amount of debt that we have in the country, which is now about 83-84 per cent of GDP. The real issue is that 40 per cent of our tax revenues is spent on paying the interest on these debts. This leaves very less for allocation of funds to the important sectors like health and education. So, the Debt to GDP ratio has to be reduced and the only way to do it really is to have a very vigorous programme of asset monetisation and public sector enterprise privatisation.

Do you suspect it’s possible that the speed of the reform journey may be impaired due to the re-emergence of the coalition era?

I don’t think so at all because, in the past actually, the coalition governments have shown a much better performance of reforms than a majority government. Also, because the TDP, especially, is a pro-reform party. I have no fear that the coalition government is going to directly imply that the reform agenda or the reform push will slow down.

The February 2024 budget showed a strong commitment to improving healthcare infrastructure and services. Can we expect this focus to continue and strengthen in the upcoming budget?

The focus on health, as well as education, has increased quite significantly. These are the two sectors which require a lot of attention and a lot of public resources. Universal access to high-quality education and universal access to high-quality primary health services is a sine qua non for a democracy. It’s an absolute must for any market economy and democratic society. I think that’s what we have to ensure. We are a long way away from that at the moment. Ayushman Bharat was a particularly good initiative covering 500 million people. But I think the next 500 will have to be covered sooner, which will still leave about 400 million who presumably can take care of themselves, but that’s not the case. The social sectors have to be strengthened very rigorously.

What measures do you believe the government should take to revive the rural economy, which is largely dependent on agriculture? Additionally, how eager do you think the government is to implement the National Cooperative Policy?

The first thing we must recognise is that our agriculture is quite backward at the moment. We are living in a state of denial because we have food security. Our agriculture sector, yield, productivity, price, and costs are all way out of line if you compare it to any other country. We need to recognise that. Only 10 per cent of our food products are processed. About 20-25 per cent is wasted. I’m told that we need 70,000 cold storages in the country, which would make life very different for our farmers. About 50 per cent of our workforce is engaged in agriculture, and that produces only 18 per cent of the GDP. So, you can see that the per capita productivity of agricultural workforce is much lower than the workforce elsewhere in the economy. Agriculture needs a lot of attention, requiring a complete paradigm shift.

Green revolution, the biochemical-based revolution which gave us our food security, did very well, but it has run its course. There are now declining returns to chemical fertilizer. They are spoiling our environment, our soil health, and much worse, the health of both our farmers and consumers. So, therefore, rural Indian agriculture needs a fresh look. I’ve been passionately propagating the spread of natural farming, like zero-chemical farming, and I hope that this budget will at least do one thing — give proportionate amount of subsidies to those not using chemical fertilizers and pesticides and following a much better and healthier agricultural practice.

Regarding energy security and transitioning to sustainable energy sources, there’s talk of a new hydro policy to promote carbon-free energy, subsidies for battery storage, and India’s first offshore wind concession. How do you view these initiatives in the context of our economic goals?

In the last 10 years, we’ve connected all our villages. The power availability is much better, but we still use only 1,200 kilowatts of energy per capita compared to the global average of 3,700 and the Americans guzzle up to around 25,000. So, we have a long way to go to meet the energy requirement of our population. A large number of people live with much less energy than they should be using, but then we must ensure that we have a green energy transition. If we go the fossil fuel route, then we will neither have an Indian environment nor will we have a planetary environment left for us to sustain and survive.

Therefore, the green energy transition is a big issue, because we have to quadruple the production and yet we must reduce our carbon footprint, which is a huge policy challenge. This will require significant concerted attention for us to be able to do that by putting together a platform where government, industry, academia and experts all come together to make this green energy transition a success.

There’s a general demand for 100 per cent GST exemption on all educational expenses for students from Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Low-Income Group (LIG) families. What is your reaction to this? Also, how do you see the potential for a closer collaboration between policymakers, the government, and startups through PPPs in the education sector?

I completely agree with it. I mean, there’s no reason for us to have GST on educational services, especially for our students from below poverty line and low-income groups. I would even go as far as to say that except for private higher education establishment, everything else in the education sector should be exempt from GST. Essentially, you’re investing in human capital. There is no reason for us to charge tax on human capital.

On GST itself, though, I’m in favor of two rates. Today we’ve got a plethora of rates, all the confusion, which it causes, leading to rent seeking. The ideal GST is a uniform GST, with one Sin Tax, leviable at a higher rate. The present GST to GDP ratio is not revenue neutral. It’s a little lower than what it was earlier when we had 14 taxes, which were all subsumed in the GST. So, the middle rate has to be raised, so that we can have a more rationalised tariff structure, say 5 per cent and a 14 per cent and be done with it, to achieve revenue neutrality and simplicity. I also think the GST Council must now discuss the inclusion of petroleum products, natural gas and electricity within GST and prevail upon the states to let this be included.

The food manufacturing sector expects the government to address the current inverted tax structure under the GST framework. This structure affects food manufacturers’ ability to claim full Input Tax Credit (ITC). Do you think there’s a chance this issue will be resolved?

I think to encourage downstream food processing, the ability for claiming full input tax credit should be simplified. It’s fair to rule out segmental distortion across industries.

The retail and consumer sector are awaiting the formulation of the National Retail Policy and a financing window specifically for retailers and distributors. What are your thoughts on these expectations?

The previous government had already allowed the entry of multinationals in retail trade. I think it’s time that we open it up and liberalise it because modern retail is a necessity for our economy and to improve our productivity and overall efficiency. I don’t think the fear that it will destroy our mom-and-pop stores and our small traders is true. Only about 5 per cent of the total retail trade is done by large stores. Even if it quadruples in the next 20 or 30 years, it will be 20 per cent. Both can coexist and help each other better compete and improve productivity for consumer welfare. I had done a study in which 3,000 people were surveyed where we found out that they will compete with these guys and they will improve their own services, home delivery, and credit availability, etc. A liberal retail trade policy will uplift everybody across the board.

The aviation and tourism industries are keenly anticipating strategic measures from the government to support their growth. Do you believe these sectors will play a crucial role in our economic growth trajectory?

The aviation sector doesn’t need handouts from the government, that’s for sure. But what needs to be done, the prime minister has been talking about it very often, is to now concretise our tourism plans and infrastructure. Our infrastructure capability at tourist destinations is extremely poor. We don’t have the capacity to handle large numbers of tourists. For example, in the Char Dham Yatra, we haven’t paid enough attention to sustainable levels of tourism. In fact, I was surprised to see in Garhwal that the local residents don’t want tourists any longer. Because they think that they are disrupting the society and the social fabric. A review of the policy framework and how to create a dynamic and yet environmentally and socially sustainable tourism in the country is the need of the hour. It can become a large employment generator and a revenue earner, but we must do it carefully.

There are expectations for enhancements and tax reliefs, such as increasing the 80C deduction limit and offering additional incentives for taxpayers to switch to the new tax regime. How do you view these potential changes, especially in terms of boosting investments in property and affordable housing projects?

I believe we have had enough of tax reliefs. We should not tinker with the tax structure, the longer we leave it in place, the better off we are. Essentially, we need to whittle down the existing exemptions. We need to take them away because that only complicates matters, benefiting CAs and not taxpayers. If we want to expand the tax base as we must, then our tax structure should be as simple as possible.

Moreover, the trust in the tax administration has to increase so that people feel that they are being fairly treated. There should be no retrospective demands that go back 10 years, 20 years. Trust is the basis for improving our tax collections, our tax compliance and for widening the tax base. Despite the digitisation and the faceless mechanism, I still find that at the level of the trader, the middle-class professional, the businesspeople, the degree of trust is still abysmal.

There is one school of opinion that’s advocating for abolition of income tax and, at the same time, rationalising GST slabs to mitigate their inherent regressive nature. Do you think such concept has any viable background in our economic landscape?

I did work on this in great depth in 2013 when I prepared the vision document for the BJP and I got in touch with the people of ‘Arthniti’ in Pune who had been advocating this. It’s a very tempting and attractive idea but I don’t think we are still prepared for it politically. We’ll have to shelve it for a while, but a day must come when, what as they propose, the abolition of income tax as well as all indirect taxes could be tried and replaced by a marginal levy (the transaction tax). Since this will be foolproof, corruption-free and rises with the economic growth, it is something worth examining. No other country has tried it, but I don’t see any harm in at least looking at it much more carefully.

Do you see there are inconsistencies and lack of fairness under the mask of climate action? To put in perspective, EU’s carbon tax and recent ban on import of certain Indian-origin products someway go to suggest it’s a concerted effort to prevent import from developing countries. Do you see climate cause is being used as a smokescreen?

I don’t want this but the carbon tax etc by developed economies is bound to be there because they are doing the same with their own citizens. I don’t think there is discrimination here and it’s just that we need to be better prepared because this is coming. You can’t deny it. So, let me leave it at that.

What is your perspective on freebies and subsidies (other than merit subsidy) in the context of the ongoing debate of Good Politics vs Good Economics?

You use the word merit subsidies and that’s good enough. Handouts are not a substitute for quality employment, and they don’t add to your self-dignity. They don’t meet the requirements of a holistic consumption. I think it’s high time that we remove all of these things and pay much greater attention to generating high-quality employment to reintegrate our small and medium enterprises which is where real employment is going to be. Integrating the small and medium enterprises into the global and regional production chains by bringing anchor investors who can create a supply chain of local vendors is the way forward.

Still, 80 per cent of our employment is in the unorganised sector and that’s something that we need to look at very carefully. The labour codes, which have been there in the making for the last six years, should be finalised in such a way that entrepreneur has zero incentive to replace labour with capital. Lastly, crucial point is that this requires huge thrust on our export industry, which is generally labour intensive. That’s where the real benefit will come from and not in handing freebies and subsidies to all and sundry.

Before you sign off, we would like to hear your views on ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and India being seen as the substitute to China as a trusted partner in the global value chain, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic. As a corollary to it, do you see a resultant interplay between comparative and competitive advantage?

Let’s be clear that ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ or self-reliance is not equal to self-sufficiency. That is an important distinction to remember. Self-reliance means a country which can pay for all its dues and look after its people without having to be dependent on others and can look after its own security means without being dependent on import. So, in that sense, this government has done quite brilliantly, to reduce the import dependence on our defence equipment — which used to be 78 per cent in 2014, and now it’s down, I think, by about 20 per cent. Manohar Parrikar started the process and it’s particularly important because defence production can also give a huge spurt to our domestic economy. That’s what the Americans and Chinese are doing. The defence production, technologies, procurement; all can boost our domestic industries.

However, on the other side, which is the manufacturing sector, we need to be plugged into the global and regional production networks, which require multistage imports and exports of components and of services, etc. It means that you become an export surplus nation, like China has become. If you’re structurally in a current account deficit, i.e., imports are much higher than your exports, your dependence continues, and it must be replenished by capital inflows from abroad, either in the form of debt or, hopefully, equity, but very often in the form of debt.

Now comparative advantage is seen to be an old and outdated idea. If South Korea can become competitive in steel, which it has become, it is only competitive advantage that matters. That implies you create capacities, which are efficient and have high productivity. We can learn from many countries in this regard.

Unfortunately, our states and our line ministers are not yet prepared to implement the China plus one option. There are still a large number of regulatory compliances despite a clear call by the prime minister to eliminate them. These result in rent-seeking. What you need to become a substitute for China is an ecosystem where your private enterprise can flourish and for support look towards the government at critical times.

We have to change that on the ground by recognising and pursuing that it is only the private enterprises, headed by private entrepreneurs, that can give India the growth dynamism. The government must be in support of such enterprises, and neither be a substitute for it nor certainly be an obstacle to it. Till we do that, we can’t succeed in China plus one, as Vietnam or even Bangladesh have done. The people who are moving out of these countries are looking for the ease of doing business that they experienced there. I think it is time that we look at this very carefully.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/must-keep-tax-structure-simple-to-expand-tax-base-ex-niti-aayog-vice-chairman-rajiv-kumar-breaks-down-budget-2024-8974365.html
news18.com,"Defence Stock Picks Ahead of Budget 2024: Analysts' Pick HAL, BEL, Azad Engineering, Others","The stock market is abuzz with speculation on potential fiscal measures and their impacts ahead of the Union Budget 2024 presentation on July 23.

Defence stocks such as Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bharat Dynamics Ltd (BDL), Cochin Shipyard Ltd, and Data Patterns India Ltd, are in focus on Monday morning as the Union Budget 2024, which is scheduled for Tuesday, July 23, is expected to see higher allocation for the sector.

To recall, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a budgetary allocation of Rs 1.72 lakh crore towards FY25 defence capital expenditure in her interim Budget 2024, which was 20.33 per cent higher than the actual expenditure of FY23 and 9.40 per cent more than the revised allocation of FY24.

Multibagger Solar Industries , Astra Microwave and Azad Engineering are the top picks of ICICI Securities in the Defence Sector. Solar Industries, Astra Microwave, Azad Engineering share price have risen 147-217 per cent in last one year giving Multibagger returns to investors.

We continue to remain positive on the sector, as the order pipeline for most of the companies remains healthy and managements have guided for 15–25 per cent revenue growth while maintaining the margins for FY25, said ICICI Securities in its report.

ICICI Securities also has a BUY rating on Dynamatic Technologies share Price with a target price of Rs 10,250. However, they await the award of the Pinaka order, which they believe is in advanced stages; Solar Industries share price is also the likely beneficiary. Also, they await the orders for QRSAM and MRSAM (Quick reaction and medium range Surface-to-Air Missiles ) which are likely to benefit Bharat Electronics, Bharat Dynamics and and Astra Microwave share price.

The ordering activity has been catching pace in last one month post the completion of Lok Sabha Elections.

Key developments in the month of June’2024 included the first Tejas Mk-1A aircraft is expected to be delivered in Jul’24.while Hindustan Aeronautics ltd also has received a Request for proposal from the Ministry of Defence on the procurement of 156 LCH Prachand helicopters. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd has won orders worth Rs 1170 Crore from Cochin shipyard.

Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Ltd has won orders worth Rs 1910 Crore order while Bharat Electronics has won orders worth Rs 3170 Crore as per ICICI Securities data. Cochin shipyard also has won orders worth Rs 1100 Crore while Solar industries has developed three new explosives.

The target price of Solar Industries share price at Rs 13250 by ICICI Securities indicates more than 13 per cent upside for the stock from current market price of Rs 11710. For Astra Microwave share price , target of ₹935 and Azad Engineering share price target of Rs 1750 are 2-4 per cent higher than current levels at which these share prices are trading and hence any corrections may be good opportunity to Buy.

Prabhudas Lilladher expects higher allocations towards aircraft, engines, and vehicles. Ministry of Defence will also continue its thrust on exports, having announced a Rs 50,000 crore defence export target by FY29, it said.

This brokerage said India’s defence story remains intact due to unrelenting focus on enhancing domestic production capabilities, improving technology of arms and armaments and push for exports.

It sees increased order inflow in segments like fighter aircraft, helicopters, armoured vehicles, missiles and naval platforms. Each platform will require new electronics such as advanced avionics, radars, fire control systems, as well as various ancillary equipment, it said.

This brokerage said a sustained focus would keep defence stocks such as HAL, BEML, BEL, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Bharat Dynamics, GRSE, Data Patterns and Cochin Shipyard buzzing.

Ahead of the Budget 2024, MOFSL initiated coverage on Zen Technologies, calling it a niche player in the defense simulator-based training market.

“The company has also forayed into the counter-drone market. The addressable markets for simulators and counter-drones in India are estimated at Rs 14,000 crore and Rs 12,000 crore, respectively, over the next five years. The company commands a significant market share in both of these segments, with just 2-3 players in the defense simulator market and 5-6 players in the counter-drone market,” it said.

Fisdom Research said stocks such as BEL, HAL and DDL to be on investor radar.

news18.com,Income Tax Slabs: Will FM Nirmala Sitharaman Change Tax Rates in Budget 2024?,"The Economic Survey 2023-24 was released on Monday, July 22, 2024, on the first day of the monsoon session of Parliament. Now, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her seventh Union Budget 2024-25 at 11 am today (July 23). As there are expectations of announcements on the income tax front, including raising exemption and standard deduction limits, here are the current tax slabs and rates.

Here are full details about the regimes and their tax rates:

In the Budget 2023, under new tax regime, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had increased the income tax exemption limit by Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh and the rebate under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, was also raised from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 7 lakh, meaning that those earning up to Rs 7 lakh do not have to pay any tax under the new regime.

Income Tax Rates for FY2023-24 (AY 2024-25):

Income Tax Slab (In Rs) Old Tax Regime New Tax Regime 0-2,50,000 0% 0% 2,50,001-3,00,000 5% 0% 3,00,001-5,00,000 5% 5% 500,001-6,00,000 20% 5% 6,00,001-9,00,000 20% 10% 9,00,001-10,00,000 20% 15% 10,00,001-12,00,000 30% 15% 12,00,000-15,00,000 30% 20% 15,00,0001 & Above 30% 30%

Note: For senior citizens (above 60 years of age), the income tax under the old regime is exempt up to Rs 3,00,000; while for super senior citizens (above 80 years), income up to Rs 5,00,000 is exempt.

Apart from this, a health and education cess is levied at 4 per cent on income tax.

Taxpayers have the option to choose either the old tax regime or the new tax regime. The default scheme would be the new tax regime.

Under the new tax regime, a resident individual (whose net income does not exceed Rs 7 lakh) can avail rebate under section 87A. The amount of rebate is 100 per cent of income tax or Rs 25,000, whichever is lower.

Under the old tax regime, a resident individual taxpayer (whose net income is up to Rs 5 lakh) can avail rebate under section 87A. The amount of rebate is 100 per cent of income tax or Rs 12,500, whichever is lower.

Union Budget 2024-25: What’s Expected?

Vivek Jalan, partner at Tax Connect Advisory Services LLP, said, “The government may move towards a ‘Single Hybrid Tax Regime’ as the new taxpayers are already in the new tax regime. It is expected that the exemption slab in the new regime may be extended from the present Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh at least.”

Further, the established taxpayers with an income of over Rs.15 Lakhs, still continue to embrace the Old regime. It is expected that the Government would also incentivise them to shift to the New Regime. Hence there may be a new slab in the new regime of say Rs 15 lakh — Rs 18 lakh with a tax rate of 25 per cent, he added.

“Slabs of New Tax regime for individuals, HUFs, etc may be rationalised to bring more people (especially established taxpayers) in the new tax regime. This will help the Government to move towards a more exemption free regime while sacrificing some exchequer’s revenue. It will bring more people in the tax net and help increase boost organised sector and reduce un-organised sector. This will boost consumption and help GDP growth of Country, thus also promoting employment generation to cater to the increased demand. On another note, it will help increase GST collections,” Jalan said.

He also expects standard deduction for salaried taxpayers to increase.

“This will help in more cash flow in hands of salaried class. It will boost consumption and help GDP growth of Country, thus also promoting employment generation to cater to the increased demand. Standard deduction was introduced in 2019 and now it is expected that should increase to at least 75,000,” Jalan said.

news18.com,Income Tax Changes In Last 3 Union Budgets and Expectations From Budget 2024,"Budget 2024 Expectations Income Tax: The budget for 2024 (fiscal year 2024-25) is set to be presented today, July 23rd, 2024. There’s a lot of anticipation surrounding income tax changes, particularly for middle-class taxpayers.

Today we bring to you a trend-check around changes in income tax in the last three Union Budgets and some of the commonly anticipated modifications in Budget 2024.

Income Tax Changes in Union Budget 2021

Key Highlights of Budget 2021

No Major Changes: There were no significant changes in income tax slabs or rates for individuals.

Senior Citizens: Individuals aged 75 years and above with only pension and interest income were exempted from filing income tax returns.

Tax Audit Limit: The tax audit limit was increased from Rs5 crore to Rs10 crore for those who carried out 95% of their transactions digitally.

Affordable Housing: The additional deduction of Rs1.5 lakh for interest paid on loans taken for affordable housing was extended for one more year.

Exemption for Covid-related payments: Introduced tax exemption for medical expenses related to Covid-19 illness.

Extended ITR filing revision period: Increased the time limit for filing a revised Income Tax Return (ITR).

Income Tax Changes in Union Budget 2022

Updated Return: An updated return could be filed within 2 years from the end of the relevant assessment year on payment of additional tax.

Digital Assets: A 30% tax on income from the transfer of virtual digital assets (VDAs), with no deduction except the cost of acquisition. A 1% TDS was introduced on payments made for the transfer of VDAs.

National Pension Scheme (NPS): Tax deduction limit for state government employees was increased to 14% from 10%.

LTCG surcharge capped: Capped the Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) surcharge at 15%, benefiting those with higher capital gains.

Deduction for disabled dependents: Allowed a lump-sum deduction for investments in annuity schemes to secure the future of disabled dependents.

Income Tax Changes in Union Budget 2023

Key Highlights of Budget 2023

New Tax Regime Changes: The new tax regime became the default regime.

Increased tax rebate under Section 87A (new regime): Increased the tax rebate under Section 87A to Rs. 25,000 for taxable incomes up to Rs. 7 lakhs, effectively making income tax zero for many in this bracket (new regime).

Increased tax slabs and exemption limit (new regime): Raised the basic exemption limit and increased tax slabs under the new regime, benefiting lower and middle-income earners.

Tax Slabs (New Regime):

Rs 0 – Rs 3 lakh: Nil

Rs 3 – Rs 6 lakh: 5%

Rs 6 – Rs 9 lakh: 10%

Rs 9 – Rs 12 lakh: 15%

Rs 12 – Rs15 lakh: 20%

Above Rs15 lakh: 30%

Standard Deduction: A standard deduction of Rs 50,000 was introduced under the new tax regime.

Reduction in Surcharge: The highest surcharge rate was reduced from 37% to 25% for income above Rs5 crore.

Leave Encashment: The limit for tax exemption on leave encashment on retirement for non-government salaried employees was increased to Rs 25 lakh.

Budget 2024 Expectations Income Tax | Taxpayer Expectations

Experts have called for relief in income tax and urged for changes in tax slabs.

Increased exemption limit or revised tax slabs: Many expect the government to raise the basic exemption limit, possibly from the current Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. There might also be adjustments to the income tax slabs under the new tax regime.

Increasing Tax Exemption

Krishan Mishra, CEO, FPSB India, urged, “With rising incomes, increasing the tax exemption limit from Rs 7.5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh will be a crucial step to encourage savings and investments among the mid-income group. It will provide much-needed relief to taxpayers and stimulate financial planning.”

Emphasising the importance of health and life insurance in the budget, Mishra added that beyond just tax savings, it will help people understand the importance of the two investments.

“If the Finance Minister highlights this, it can educate the masses on the necessity of insurance for financial security, rather than just a tax-saving tool,” Mishra noted.

Making the New Regime Attractive

Prof. Sangita Dutta Gupta, Professor of Economics, BML Munjal University, highlighted that salaried taxpayers have not embraced the new tax regime fully.

“The new tax regime may still be good for income below Rs 15 lakh. However, there is no inflation adjustment above Rs. 15 Lakh. Thus, taxpayers in the high-income bracket prefer the old regime over the new one. It would be helpful if a tax rate of 30% were imposed on incomes above Rs 25 lakh. It will make the new tax regime attractive and at the same time propel consumption and savings,” Gupta said.

Section 80C Limit

Mitesh Jain, Partner at Economic Laws Practice pointed out that salaried individuals who opt for the old tax regime will benefit from an increase in Section 80C limits as it may reduce their tax liability depending upon the tax bracket.

“Assuming that the tax slabs are not tweaked in the budget, for an individual having gross total income of Rs 10 lakhs or Rs 15 lakhs, the old regime would be beneficial if aggregate deductions are more than Rs 2,62,500 and Rs 3,75,000 respectively. Therefore, with increased Section 80C limits, more taxpayers may opt for the old tax regime as it would be easier to achieve break-even deduction contributions,” Jain said.

Other Expectations

Standard deduction hike: The standard deduction, which reduces taxable income, might be raised from the current Rs 50,000.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/tax/income-tax-slab-rate-changes-last-3-union-budgets-expectations-budget-2024-predictions-8973976.html
news18.com,"FM Sitharaman Set To Present Union Budget 2024-25: From Sector Expectations To Key Numbers, All You Need To Know","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget 2024-25 in the Lok Sabha today July 23. This will be her seventh consecutive budget, making her only the second finance minister to achieve this feat after C D Deshmukh. This will be the first budget of the Modi 3.0 government and is expected to give a push to initiatives in various segments of the economy, in line with the Viksit Bharat 2047 Vision, while maintaining fiscal prudence.

Sitharaman will start her Budget Speech at 11 am today.

The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on Monday held an important meeting before the budget, in which floor management and strategy to counter the opposition narrative were discussed, according to sources. All MPs have been asked to be present in the House. After the budget presentation, common points will be shared with all allies to ensure everybody is on the same page, sources added.

Budget Expectations: Income Tax

Sitharaman is expected to announce changes on the income tax front, including raising exemption and standard deduction limits.

Single Hybrid Tax Regime: The government may move towards a ‘Single Hybrid Tax Regime’ as new taxpayers are already in the new tax regime. The exemption slab in the new regime is expected to be extended from the current ₹3 lakh to at least ₹4 lakh.

Incentives for Old Regime Taxpayers: Established taxpayers with income over ₹15 lakh still prefer the old regime. The government is expected to incentivise them to shift to the new regime, possibly introducing a new slab for incomes between ₹15 lakh and ₹18 lakh with a tax rate of 25%.

Standard Deduction: The finance minister is also expected to increase the standard deduction for salaried taxpayers to ₹1 lakh.

Real Estate Sector

The real estate sector has high hopes from this budget, with demands ranging from tax reliefs to affordable housing initiatives and land-related announcements.

Industry Status: The sector is pushing for ‘industry’ status to attract investments and streamline regulations.

Interest Deduction on Housing Loans: Raising the interest deduction limit on housing loans under Section 24B from ₹2 lakh to ₹5 lakh is a key demand.

Holding Period for Capital Gains: The government is expected to cut the holding period for capital gains on real estate to 12 months from the current 24 months and reduce the long-term capital gains tax rate which is currently at 20%.

Affordable Housing Criteria: The sector is pressing for raising the cost, size and income criteria for affordable housing to make it more inclusive. Currently, the criteria for affordable housing are based on the cost of the property (Rs 45 lakh), carpet area (60 sq. m to 90 sq. m), and income of the homebuyer (EWS / LIG).

What Industries, Including MSMEs, Expect

The government has focused on expanding the adoption of clean technologies and supporting the growth of industries, especially startups and MSMEs.

Infrastructure and Production Costs: The industry expects the government to improve infrastructure and lower production costs for MSMEs. Upgrading power infrastructure in industrial areas and further simplifying labour laws are necessary steps.

Compliance and Clearances: Streamlining pollution control clearances and reducing compliance costs are also key expectations.

Economic Survey 2023-24

Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2023-24 on Monday, setting the stage for the Union Budget 2024-25. It pegged India’s economic growth at 6.5%-7% for the current financial year 2024-25, with inflation at 4.5%. The survey remained bullish on the country’s growth prospects, focusing on job creation and skill development.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi remarked, “The Economic Survey highlights the prevailing strengths of our economy and showcases the outcomes of the various reforms our government has brought. It also identifies areas for further growth and progress as we move towards building a Viksit Bharat.”

Leading up to this, the Economic Survey has been tabled in Parliament today by the finance minister, offering a detailed assessment of the country’s economic landscape.

Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects of the upcoming Budget and their potential impact on different sections of society.

Income Tax Announcements

One of the most closely watched sections of any budget is the income tax proposals. In past Budgets, the government has introduced several changes aimed at providing relief to the middle class and boosting disposable income.

Tax Slabs Adjustment: The basic exemption limit is currently at Rs 3 lakh, means that those earning up to this level do not have to pay any tax. Additionally, the tax rates for various slabs have been adjusted in the past few Budgets, potentially lowering the overall tax burden for many individuals.

Standard Deduction Increase: There have been talks going on regarding the government likely to raise the standard deduction to Rs 1 lakh, from the current Rs 50,000. This move may simplify tax calculations and provide more disposable income to salaried employees.

Business and Industry

The budget will likely have several provisions aimed at supporting businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are the backbone of the Indian economy.

Corporate Tax: Corporate tax, which is a major source of revenue for the central government, is a vital component of India’s fiscal framework. It plays a significant role in the nation’s annual Budget. Any changes in that may impact businesses. Apart from that, it is also expected to provide incentives for startups and SMEs.

Manufacturing Boost: The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme has been extended to more sectors in the past few years, encouraging domestic manufacturing and reducing dependency on imports. The Budget 2024 is expected to further expand its scope to boost the Make in India initiative.

Ease of Doing Business: The Budget 2024-25 is expected to announce simplified regulations and digitisation of processes aimed at making it easier to start and run a business in India. The government’s announcements on infrastructure will further enhance the business environment.

Social Welfare and Infrastructure

The Budget is also expected to focus on social welfare schemes and infrastructure development, which will have long-term benefits for the population.

Healthcare and Education: Significant allocations could be made for the healthcare and education sectors. The government is likely to set up more medical colleges and improve the quality of education through digital initiatives. This will ensure better access to healthcare and education for the masses.

Infrastructure Development: Massive investments in infrastructure, including roads, railways, and urban development, are expected to create jobs and spur economic growth. The focus on renewable energy and green projects will also contribute to sustainable development.

Social Security: The Budget 2024-25 is likely to have enhanced provisions for social security, including pensions and insurance for the underprivileged, aimed at providing a safety net for the most vulnerable sections of society.

Agriculture and Rural Development

Agriculture remains a priority, with several measures aimed at improving the income and livelihood of farmers.

Direct benefit transfers (DBT): Increased allocations for DBT schemes ensure that subsidies and benefits reach farmers directly, reducing leakages and improving efficiency.

Rural Infrastructure: Investments in rural infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation, and storage facilities, aim to boost agricultural productivity and connectivity.

Agri-Tech Initiatives: Encouragement for agri-tech startups and adoption of modern farming techniques will help farmers increase their yields and income.

The Budget 2024-25 is a comprehensive document that aims to address the needs of various sections of society. While the immediate impact may vary, the long-term benefits of increased disposable income, better business conditions, improved social welfare, and enhanced infrastructure will contribute to overall economic growth and stability. Staying informed and adapting to these changes will help individuals and businesses navigate the evolving economic landscape effectively.

news18.com,With Budget 2024 FM Nirmala Sitharaman Is Set To Create History; Here's How,"Union Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to create history when she presents her seventh straight Budget on Tuesday for the fiscal 2024-25, surpassing the record of former prime minister Morarji Desai.

Sitharaman, who will turn 65 next month, was in 2019 appointed as India’s first full-time woman finance minister when Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a decisive second term. Since then, she has presented six straight budgets, including an interim one in February this year.

The full Budget for the 2024-25 fiscal (April 2024 to March 2025) will be her seventh straight. She will better Desai’s record, who presented consecutive five full budgets and one interim budget between 1959 to 1964.

This year will witness two budgets – an interim one in February and a full one this month. This is because an incumbent government cannot present a full Budget just before general elections.

The presentation on July 23 will be the first Budget by the BJP-led NDA government since it was re-elected last month.

Here are some facts related to Budget presentation in Independent India:

FIRST BUDGET: The first-ever Union Budget of independent India was presented on November 26, 1947, by the nation’s first finance minister RK Shanmukham Chetty.

MOST NUMBER OF BUDGETS: Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai holds the record for presenting the most budgets. He has presented a total of 10 budgets during his tenure as finance minister under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and later under Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.

He presented his first budget on February 28, 1959, and presented full budgets in the following two years before presenting an interim one in 1962. This was followed by two full budgets. After four years, he presented another interim budget in 1967, followed by three full budgets in 1967, 1968, and 1969, presenting a total of 10 budgets.

SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER OF BUDGET: Former finance minister P Chidambaram presented the budget on nine occasions. He first presented the Budget on March 19, 1996, during the United Front government led by Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda. He presented another budget under the same government next year and returned to the hot seat when the Congress-led UPA came to power in 2014.

He presented five budgets between 2004 and 2008. After a stint as Union Home Minister, he was back in the finance ministry and presented budgets in 2013 and 2014.

THIRD HIGHEST NUMBER OF BUDGETS: Pranab Mukherjee presented eight budgets during his tenure as finance minister. He presented budgets in 1982, 1983 and 1984 and five straight ones between February 2009 and March 2012 in the Congress-led UPA government.

MANMOHAN SINGH: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh presented five straight budgets between 1991 and 1995 when he was finance minister in the P V Narasimha Rao government.

LONGEST BUDGET SPEECH: Sitharaman holds the record for the longest budget speech when her presentation on February 1, 2020, lasted two hours and 40 minutes. At the time, she cut short her speech with two pages remaining.

SHORTEST BUDGET SPEECH: Hirubhai Mulljibhai Patel’s interim Budget speech in 1977 is so far the shortest at just 800 words.

TIMING: The Budget was traditionally presented on the last day of February at 5 pm. The timing followed a colonial era practice when the announcements could be made in London and India at the same time. India is 4 hours and 30 minutes ahead of the British Summer Time, and so presenting the budget at 5 pm in India ensured that it was happening in the daytime in the United Kingdom.

The timing was changed in 1999 when the then finance minister Yashwant Singh in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government presented the budget at 11 am.

Since then budgets are presented at 11 am.

DATE: The Budget presentation date was in 2017 changed to the 1st of February to allow the government to complete the Parliamentary approval process by March-end and allow implementation of the Budget from the start of the fiscal on April 1.

Presenting the Budget on February 29 meant that the implementation could not start before May/June after accounting for 2-3 months of the parliamentary approval process.

news18.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Investment In Oil Exploration, Tax Rebate On Solar, Energy Sector Wish-list","As the Union Budget 2024 approaches, industry leaders from the energy sector are voicing their expectations and hopes for supportive policies and reforms. Kapil Garg, Chairman & Managing Director of Oilmax Energy, emphasises the need for regulatory changes and GST incorporation to stabilise gas prices and boost oil exploration investments. Amit Uplenchwar of Kalpataru Projects International Limited (KPIL) calls for swift government actions to support advanced energy solutions and infrastructure development.

Experts like Neerav Nanavaty, CEO of BluPine Energy, highlight the importance of boosting renewable sector support to drive innovation and ensure project execution. Sharad Pungalia of Amplus Solar urges the alleviation of tax burdens on solar projects and better credit access for MSMEs.

N.P Ramesh, COO of Orb Energy, anticipates measures to enhance residential solar adoption and incentivize commercial investments.

These industry voices collectively underscore the necessity for strategic government interventions to propel the energy sector towards a sustainable and prosperous future.

Oil and Gas Sector

Kapil Garg, Chairman & Managing Director, Oilmax Energy, is optimistic that the needs of the oil and gas sector will be recognised and addressed.

This sector has the potential to grow rapidly, but it requires supportive regulatory reforms to be implemented promptly.

“Incorporating GST into gas pricing is crucial at this juncture. Stabilising gas prices across the nation, which have been inconsistent and created significant disparities within the industry, is equally important,” Garg says.

Investment In Oil Exploration

Garg adds that with a potential decline in oil production by 2030, increasing investment in oil exploration is essential. This will not only build confidence among domestic players to venture beyond shallow waters and into deep-sea exploration but also ensure sustained growth in capacity, he says.

Continued capital expenditure (CAPEX) investment is necessary, particularly in energy, logistics, and infrastructure, including gas pipelines and railway corridors.

‘Swift Government Actions On Energy Project Approvals’

Amit Uplenchwar, Director, Kalpataru Projects International Limited (KPIL), highlights that the government has set ambitious targets for deploying advanced energy solutions, including clean hydrogen, energy storage, and carbon capture, with a planned investment of $35 billion annually until 2030.

“The industry requires swift government actions on project approvals and supportive policies for sustainable energy transmission and dissemination, such as production-linked incentives, tax credits, and subsidies. GAIL’s proposal for a 1500 KTPA ethane cracker unit in Madhya Pradesh could be a game-changer, fostering numerous public-private partnerships and generating thousands of jobs,” Uplenchwar says.

Uplenchwar also adds that significant government intervention is needed in the oil & gas, energy, and transmission & distribution (T&D) sectors in the form of financial aid and support for technology development, and to keep up the infrastructure momentum which are crucial for domestic business growth.

Skilled Workforce In the Renewable Sector

Neerav Nanavaty, CEO at BluPine Energy urges the government to significantly boost support for the renewable sector, pivotal for driving innovation and ensuring efficient project execution.

Nanavaty underlines that a skilled workforce is crucial to meet escalating demands and push technological boundaries forward.

Grid Infrastructure

Nanavaty notes that the seamless integration of renewable sources into a resilient grid infrastructure will enhance national reliability and resilience. Robust regulations for the C & I sector will not only attract investments but also streamline operations, fostering sustainable growth.

“We expect increased support in the solar sector through adequate funding and favourable policies, essential for driving innovation and expanding clean energy deployment. Despite challenges such as high initial costs and regulatory complexities, robust incentives and streamlined processes are imperative to make solar power more accessible and affordable. This strategic focus will propel India towards a brighter, greener future, reinforcing our global leadership in clean energy innovation and sustainability,” Nanavaty adds.

Support Solar Projects

Sharad Pungalia, MD & CEO of Amplus Solar urges the government to support solar projects by alleviating the existing tax burden on project costs, especially now that the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) has been fully implemented.

Pungalia says that there must be rationalisation of GST across all components of the solar sector, and the government should consider eliminating the Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on solar modules.

Battery Energy Storage Systems

Pungalia points out that implementing concessional duties on Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) is crucial to advancing our storage capabilities and ensuring a stable and reliable energy supply.

Credit Access for MSMEs

MSMEs represent a significant demand sector, particularly for rooftop and residential solar projects. By integrating them more comprehensively into the financial system, we can significantly boost capacity additions and drive growth within the solar sector, Pungalia says.

Pungalia expects the budget to facilitate increased credit access for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) through targeted lending by financial institutions.

Enhancing Residential Solar Adoption

N.P Ramesh, Co-founder and COO, Orb Energy, says the solar industry eagerly anticipates pivotal measures to accelerate India’s renewable energy goals.

According to Ramesh, key priorities include enhancing residential solar adoption with proposed personal income tax benefits up to 3 lakhs.

“This can be considered instead of the current subsidy of Rs.78,000. For commercial and industrial (C&I) sectors, increasing depreciation benefits to 60-80% from the current 40% will incentivize substantial investments in solar installations, bolstering sustainability efforts across businesses,” Ramesh adds.

Anti-dumping Duties

Ramesh also urges the removal of anti-dumping duties on raw materials for solar modules is crucial to enhancing manufacturing competitiveness and reducing dependency on imports.

Additionally, a proposed 7-year tax holiday for investments in PV module or solar cell production will stimulate domestic manufacturing capabilities, fostering job creation and economic growth, Ramesh says.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/budget-2024-expectations-energy-sector-india-solar-oil-gas-8973249.html

news18.com,Budget 2024 Expectations Highlights: Will Govt Bring Changes In Old and New Tax Regimes?,"Union Budget 2024 LIVE: Will FM Will Give Affordable Housing Initiatives? Stay informed with our comprehensive coverage of Union Budget 2024.

Union Budget 2024 LIVE: FM Sitharaman To Present Survey Today, Check Latest Updates Stay informed about the latest updates on Economic Survey LIVE. The Economic Survey will be tabled around 1 PM.

Budget 2024 Live Updates: 'Tax Rebate On Home Loan Interest Should Be Rs 5 lakh' Mohit Jain, Managing Director, Krisumi Corporation, said; “We expect the Government to continue its thrust on infrastructure development, which will boost the real estate sector across cities including the peripheries of metros as well as in tier II and III cities. The upcoming budget should provide greater benefits to the salaried class as they have played a pivotal role in record-high direct tax collections. One such step would be to increase the tax exemption limit on both the principal amount and interest paid on home loans.” “Amid a substantial rise in property value over the last couple of years, the current Rs 2 lakh tax rebate on housing loan interest should be enhanced to a minimum of Rs 5 lakh. Such a step will boost demand for residential properties. Similarly, a separate section should be introduced for the deduction against home loan principal repayment as the present Rs 1.5 lakh limit under section 80(C) is inadequate. Given the government’s ongoing push for housing for all, we also anticipate the relaunch of the CLSS scheme, which will boost housing demand across various segments. The Government should also look at implementing the single window clearance system for all project-related approvals, a long-pending demand of the industry. This will considerably reduce delays thereby benefitting all stakeholders including the government, developers as well as end users i.e. home buyers.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Demand For Innovation In Renewable Technologies Anmol Singh Jaggi, Chairman and Managing Director, Gensol Engineering, said; “As India’s energy demand rises, boosting the share of renewables is crucial for energy security and sustainability, the upcoming union budget is expected to focus on achieving the 500GW target by 2030 and incentivizing technologies to reduce renewable energy intermittency, like energy storage solutions. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are essential for advancing India’s renewable goals. Previous budgets have significantly increased funding for the advanced chemistry cell sector, showing the government’s commitment to energy storage.” “We anticipate continued support for cell manufacturing and BESS, along with Production Linked Incentives (PLI) for raw material processing. Additionally, growing the green hydrogen industry will likely be a key focus, replacing fossil fuels in transportation and hard-to-abate sectors like refining, steel, and cement. At Gensol Engineering, we are dedicated to reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change through the engineering, design, development, and deployment of solar and BESS projects. By providing comprehensive EPC and O&M services , we aim to lead in renewable energy and support India’s energy transition goals.” Amit Jain, CEO & Country Manager ENGIE, India, stated; “We look forward to the government’s strategic framework that will accelerate the shift to a low-carbon economy. The upcoming budget should encourage innovation in renewable technologies and support investments in solar power and other renewable sources. A simplified regulatory environment is essential for integrating renewables into the national grid, ensuring energy security and stability. Additionally, we hope for initiatives promoting public-private partnerships to develop distributed energy infrastructure. India has set a bold target of achieving 500GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, reflecting significant growth in this sector.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Tax Rebate On Medical Devices Pavan Choudary, Chairman, Medical Technology Association of India (MTaI), said, “The gross customs duties on medical devices coming into India is between 13 to 16 %, whereas in our neighbourhood that is Sri Lanka, Nepal, etc. is less than 5 %. This creates opportunities for illicit smuggling of these devices which means losses to the exchequer and the patient being burdened with devices that do not have adequate legal or service guarantees. This is one important reason why customs duties on medical devices should be brought down. The other reason concerns patient affordability which is a top priority of the government. A consistent customs duty reduction will go towards improving affordability and access.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Top Demands From Power Sector Pratik Agarwal, MD Sterlite Power and Chairman Serentica Renewables, said; “There are crucial expectations for the power sector. I hope this term focuses on achieving a comprehensive turnaround of discoms. Many initiatives have been taken in the past to incrementally improve the situation, but we expect strong steps in this direction to ensure the sector’s well-being. Pushing for full retail competition should be a focus. To maintain the momentum built in the last 5 years, it’ll be paramount to extend the full ISTS waiver for another 2 years to sustain RE adoption by all categories of power consumers. While protectionism helps a certain segment, I would expect the government to open the sector to source the most competitive components globally, with a focus on the swift and cost-effective deployment of RE and transmission in the country. As we add unprecedented green energy to the grid, the next phase must also concentrate on preparing the country for large-scale RE integration. This will entail a strong policy push towards strengthening interconnectors with neighbouring nations, deploying extensive energy storage solutions, and exploring upcoming technologies like Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMRs) for a diversified energy mix. The stage is ripe, and the country awaits the next phase of growth towards a sustainable energy future.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates Anil G Verma, CEO & Executive Director, Godrej and Boyce, said; “As we approach Budget 2024, I am optimistic that the new government will build upon the solid foundation laid by the interim budget, which focused on boosting infrastructure development, maintaining fiscal prudence, and laying progressive emphasis on women, youth, farmers, and the underprivileged through skilling, welfare measures and financial assistance. The important area that needs to be addressed now, amongst others, is the continued lower-than-expected growth in private consumption. Private consumption drives private investment and therefore I am hopeful that the GoI will take steps that boost consumption through a slew of measures that could include optimizing GST rates, reviewing of personal income tax slabs and reassessment of the interest rates to provide EMI relief to the large masses whose purchases of assets such as homes and consumer durables are thorough loans. The above will not only provide tailwinds to the consumer durables industry but also have a multiplier effect on the industries that serve them, through increased capacity utilization and hence also pave the way for private investments to flow in at a faster pace. Looking ahead, I hope that the upcoming budget continues to prioritize these areas while also introducing policies that promote innovation, production-linked incentives (PLIs), and sustainable practices. These measures are crucial for driving holistic economic growth and ensuring balanced and inclusive development for India.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates Neeraj Akhoury, MD Shree Cement, said; “As we approach the Union Budget 2024-25, the cement industry is optimistic about significant allocations to housing and infrastructure, which account for over 80% of the demand for cement. The Interim Budget in February showed the government’s commitment with an 11.1% increase in infrastructure capital expenditure, totalling Rs 11.11 lakh crore, or 3.4% of the GDP. We expect further spending on highways, roads, bridges, and urban development, alongside more funds for projects. The announcement of a cement corridor in the Interim Budget has been encouraging, and we hope for more steps to enhance transport integration, making the movement of cement and related materials more efficient. While the Union Government’s overall policies have supported the Cement industry, we could enhance the scope to further contribute to strengthening our economy. The cement industry multiplies all levers of the economy, especially employment generation, with studies suggesting that every 1 Million tons of cement creates 20, 000 direct and indirect employment. The Budget should pave a path for faster development of new projects, through simplifying and accelerating regulatory processes (like environmental clearances) as well as land procurement. India is currently the 2nd largest producer of cement in the world and yet we have one of the lowest per capita consumption. To grow our economy, India would need large investments to create new production facilities. The extension of the PLI scheme to the cement sector could further drive investments and technological advancements, aligning with the Make in India initiative and enhancing the industry’s global competitiveness. Additionally, job creation and agricultural growth are necessary to increase rural spending on housing. Higher MNREGA allocations could boost rural employment, and increasing funds for rural-focused schemes, such as the PM Gramin Awas Yojana, will support rural housing construction. Increasing the home loan deduction limit can add momentum to the housing demand and increasing allocation to PM Urban Awas Yojana, will support in construction of affordable housing. We also hope the government continues its focus on reforms, incentives, and tax relief for adopting sustainable manufacturing techniques. Supporting green energy and alternative fuels is crucial for promoting sustainable growth in the cement sector. Renewable Energy (RE) is a priority to reduce CO2 emissions and energy costs. My recommendation is to both simplify and unify RE policies across states. As an example, many states disallow power banking facilities and have different charges and incentives. We are hopeful for more uniform RE policies across all states to significantly increase RE adoption. Additionally, the cement industry has the potential to generate 1,300 MW of clean energy by installing waste heat recovery systems (WHRS), directly reducing energy wastage. The industry and the overall ecosystem would greatly benefit if power generated through WHRS were given the same benefits as Renewable Energy, such as being considered for Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) compliance. The upcoming Union Budget 2024-25 presents an opportunity for transformative changes in the cement industry. By addressing these key areas, the government can support sustainable growth, boost infrastructure development and enhance the global competitiveness of the Indian cement sector. We look forward to a budget that supports these initiatives and drives our industry toward a more prosperous future.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates A Kulandai Vadivelu, Chief Financial Officer, TVS Electronics, said, “There is a pressing need for a growth-oriented tax environment to catalyze India’s economic progress and from the Union Budget, we expect the finance minister to look at reforming the Goods and Services Tax (GST) structure, including rationalization of rates and simplification of compliance procedures. The manufacturing sector is very capital-intensive and the introduction of tax holidays and enhanced input credits for upcoming manufacturing units will be crucial in stabilizing operations and expansion. Overall, industry friendly tax assessments can reduce the time and effort spent on compliance and in turn allow companies to focus on growth. India’s manufacturing sector will be a key contributor towards the goal of becoming a $10 trillion economy. The budget should emphasize making India self-reliant and become a global manufacturing hub, and in turn boost the Make-in-India initiative. Hence, policies that support local manufacturing will be helpful. According to the latest report by the CII, India’s Electronics Manufacturing is expected to reach USD500Bn by 2030. One of the key pillars of the growing electronics manufacturing industry is electronics manufacturing services (EMS), which includes services such as designing, manufacturing, testing, distributing and servicing electronic components and assemblies for OEMs. PLIs for the EMS sector will increase the contribution of the manufacturing industry towards our economy, and help create jobs, which is the need of the hour. Extending incentives for research and development (R&D) and digitalization will contribute towards creating an enabling environment for expansion of the sector and also position India as a factory for the world.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Potential Tax Relief, Income Tax Exemption Limits In New Tax Regime Arvind Nandan, Managing Director – Research & Consulting at Savills India; “We anticipate a strong emphasis on infrastructure and innovation to address the housing deficit in both rural and urban areas, particularly through schemes aimed at enhancing rental housing. Potential tax relief, including adjustments to income tax exemption limits in the new tax regime, could significantly benefit lower-income earners. Adjustments to income tax brackets for individuals earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh annually are expected to enhance spending power and stimulate economic activity, which is crucial for the middle class. We also foresee further support for the affordable housing sector through reinstated PMAY incentives, while GST reforms will be crucial for ensuring nationwide accessibility. The budget is likely to sustain focus on sustainable development and green innovation, promoting environmentally friendly practices in infrastructure projects.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Removing Angel Tax Regime Anirudh A Damani, Managing Partner- Artha Venture Fund; “As the new government’s first budget, our expectations are notably high. We anticipate significant measures to streamline the entrepreneurial ecosystem, starting with removing the angel tax regime, which currently burdens startups substantially. Additionally, reducing GST slabs and abolishing other indirect tax regimes in favor of a single, efficient GST system would greatly simplify compliance for businesses. Another crucial initiative would be establishing a business bank catering to SMEs and startups. Traditional banks often fail to meet the unique needs of these entities. A dedicated business bank could unlock vital credit and provide essential financial services tailored to business needs, such as business savings accounts, working capital loans, and business banking credit cards. Investors also look forward to a more straightforward tax regime, particularly the harmonization and simplification of LTCG (Long-Term Capital Gains) and STCG (Short-Term Capital Gains) taxes for listed securities and startups. Simplifying the complex web of tax laws would reduce confusion and minimize harassment from tax authorities who may misinterpret the regulations. While tax reduction is always welcome, the primary need of the hour is simplifying the tax code. Implementing a direct tax code, as promised for many years, would be a monumental step towards achieving a more transparent and efficient tax system. Our high expectations reflect the potential for this budget to foster a more robust and supportive environment for startups and SMEs, driving economic growth and innovation.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates Sumit Mukhija, CEO and Executive Director, STT GDC India, said; “The Union Budget 2024 represents an important opportunity to promote AI usage in India’s data center business. As technology is rapidly evolving, we anticipate initiatives to promote innovation and growth in this area. With India’s data consumption skyrocketing and an increased need for AI-powered solutions, we expect the budget to introduce incentives for AI-focused infrastructure investments. This might include tax breaks for AI-specific gear and software, support for AI research and development, and efforts to establish a competent AI-skilled workforce. Such initiatives would not only benefit the data center industry but will also establish India as a global leader in AI technology and digital transformation. Together, we are capable of creating a future in which India leads in technical advancement and innovation.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates Ravi Kunwar, Vice President- India & APAC, HMD, said, “We look forward to the upcoming Union Budget 2024-25 with a focus on initiatives that propel domestic manufacturing and foster a thriving Indian mobile phone ecosystem. We particularly look forward to extending or improving the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. This policy has been instrumental in propelling domestic manufacturing, and its continuation will be crucial for building a robust indigenous component supply chain. We also wish that the government prioritizes the policies that incentivize the production of key smartphone components within India, fostering a self-reliant ecosystem.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Changes In Insurance Sector Shailesh Kumar, Co-Founder & Insurance Head, Insurance Samadhan; “As the budget session approaches, we are optimistic about positive changes in the insurance sector. I am particularly hopeful about the possibilities of reforms that can further enhance the insurance landscape in India. The previous budget did not meet the expectations of the insurance industry and the consumers. However, this past year, with the government’s efforts to make healthcare more accessible and increasing transparency in the insurance sector, I am expecting measures that could make insurance products more consumer-centric.” “Currently, India’s insurance penetration stands at a record of 4%, and to increase this number, we hope there will be some reform to boost the tax incentives for life and health insurance products. Such a move could make them more affordable for the middle class. Improved and enhanced digitalization and streamlined claim settlement processes could also add momentum, which may help insurance companies deliver faster and more efficient services to their customers. Such measures can boost consumer confidence for participating in insurance schemes and enable us to create a system that supports innovation and transparency in the insurance sector.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates Nikhel Bothra, Director, EPACK Prefab “As a country, we must become more adaptable to pre-engineered buildings and prefabricated structures, as they are more evolved versions of construction. These are sustainable solutions to the construction demands of the country. In doing so, we are committing to innovation as well as environment-friendly practices. Considerations such as a constructive regulatory framework would enhance the utilisation of PEBs within the industry, and lowering GST or incentivizing the use of Prefabricated Engineered Buildings (PEBs) in government infrastructure projects could be instrumental steps in this direction. Furthermore, subsiding/incentivising the use of PEBs and prefab structures; or introductions of new schemes like the regional-connectivity schemes – UDAN & PM Gati Shakti scheme could be instrumental in realising the true potential of the country as a developed nation.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Economic Survey On July 22 The Economic Survey will be tabled in the Parliament on July 22. First, it will be presented in the Lok Sabha at 1 pm and then Rajya Sabha will be familiarised with the document at around 2 pm.

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates Manoj Nair, Head of Global Delivery Centres, Fujitsu said, “With close to 25% of the global workforce coming from India over the next decade, skill development and empowerment should be a strategic imperative. A skilled workforce is crucial for economic development. As technology rapidly advances, we need to prepare young people with a mix of education and skills to help meet the future needs of our economy. Now is the time to bolster digital literacy by establishing dedicated centres of excellence. Looking ahead to Budget 2024, another area that calls for a greater emphasis is research and development (R&D) initiatives to enhance our competitiveness especially in AI. I remain optimistic that the government will introduce more ground-breaking and transformative initiatives, thus elevating AI use cases and intellectual property creation. By accelerating AI innovation, we can enhance the country’s technology development ecosystem and provide a major boost to sectors including healthcare and automotive among others. In addition to AI, we must also elevate the country’s technology development ecosystem by strengthening the semiconductor space, which can provide a greater boost to sectors including healthcare and consumer electronics among others. As we focus on advancing technology, sustainability should always remain top of mind. The need of the hour is to focus on sustainability and energy efficiency solutions to reduce carbon emissions. Now more than ever, there is a need to prioritize sustainable development and green initiatives, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy projects. Together, we have the opportunity to shape a future where India leads in technological advancements and innovation.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Reforming Cancer Care in India D. S. Negi, CEO, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre (RGCIRC), urged, “As we look forward to the 2024 Budget, the focus on reforming cancer care in India is crucial. It’s important to prioritize funding for advanced treatments like immunotherapy and personalized medicine, ensuring more patients can access these cutting-edge therapies. Extending Ayushman Bharat to those aged above 70 will be highly beneficial for senior citizens. However, the current coverage limit of Rs. 5 lakh may not be sufficient for critical illnesses such as cancer, where treatment costs can range from Rs. 15-20 lakhs. Therefore, it is essential to consider increasing the coverage limit for critical illnesses like cancer to ensure adequate financial support for cancer patients. Expanding screening programs for cancers like cervical, breast, and colorectal can catch diseases earlier, improving the chances of successful treatment. Building more specialized cancer treatment centers and supporting healthcare workers with better training are essential steps. Public awareness campaigns about prevention and symptoms will also play a key role in fighting cancer effectively. These efforts, alongside international collaborations and incentives for new cancer treatments, can bring significant improvements to cancer care across the country.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Renewable Energy Sector Rajeev Kashyap, VP and MD, Nextracker India, urged, “With the upcoming union budget, we anticipate the new government will reaffirm its commitment to renewable energy, particularly in innovation, local manufacturing, technological integration, and R&D within the solar energy sector. This focus is essential for unlocking the nation’s clean energy potential, de-risking the supply chain, and enhancing the reliability of solar power systems. Further, lowering GST rates on solar devices and systems would not only spur domestic manufacturing but also amplify project returns, driving economic growth. Additionally, the budget should prioritize incentives and policies that strengthen battery storage, supporting our increasing reliance on renewable energy. There is also a pressing need to develop a skilled workforce tailored for the renewable energy industry. By fostering a robust domestic manufacturing ecosystem, India can accelerate its solar installation capacity and make significant contributions to global decarbonization efforts. With the right policies and collaborative efforts, we are confident that India can achieve its ambitious goals and emerge as a global leader in the clean energy revolution.”",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/budget-2024-expectations-live-updates-date-time-railway-defence-budget-income-tax-slabs-key-prediction-20-july-2024-liveblog-8972206.html
news18.com,Budget 2024: Will FM Sitharaman Announce Major Income Tax Changes In Budget 2024?,"Budget 2024 Expectations from Real Estate Players Kaushal Agarwal, chairman of The Guardians Real Estate Advisory, said, “As we approach the budget announcement, the real estate sector is eagerly anticipating transformative reforms that can drive sustainable growth and prosperity. Key measures such as extending the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), providing tax holidays, and revising base prices are crucial for enhancing affordability and stimulating investment in housing. Likewise, granting ‘industry status’ to housing and implementing a streamlined single-window approval system will further boost efficiency and attract more investments. Additionally, clearer regulations and increased investments in the Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) sector are also essential for sustainable growth. We look forward to collaborative efforts with the government that will address longstanding challenges and propel urban development across the country.” Heeralal Doshi, founder and chairman at Kinjal Group, said, ““As announcement of the Union Budget 2024-25 comes near, India’s real estate sector awaits significant policy shifts under the Modi 3.0 govt. With growing demand for housing, offices, and commercial zones, we hope for tax incentives and infrastructure upgrades to improve urban living and boost growth in emerging areas. Granting ‘industry status’ to the housing sector could incentives growth and attract significant investment. Additionally, the introduction of a single window approval system for real estate construction would also streamline processes, reduce delays, and boost efficiency across the sector. The EPC sector in India needs more investments and clearer regulations to thrive. New tax rules can help EPC firms overcome challenges and innovate. The upcoming budget is also set to focus on smart cities, renewable energy, and high-speed rail, aiming to modernize infrastructure and drive economic growth.”

Real Estate Expectations from Budget 2024 Navdeep Sardana, Founder and Chairman, Whiteland Corporation said, “We are confident that the upcoming budget announcement will reflect the government’s commitment towards expanding the growing economy by prioritising real estate sector and infrastructure development in the country. In the previous budgets, the government has also shown a keen interest in leveraging eco-friendly construction practices to create sustainable, future-ready infrastructure projects. Hence, we do not expect any major changes in the tax structure, which might dissuade investors from the property market.” Gaurav K Singh, founder and chairman of Womeki Group, said, “As a real estate company, we anticipate the government to introduce measures that will drive sector growth and investment in the budget. Key expectations include tax incentives, such as reductions in GST rates on construction materials and real estate transactions, which would lower costs and improve affordability. We also hope for increased tax deductions on home loan interest and principal repayments to encourage home purchases. Additionally, we expect enhanced regulatory and infrastructural support from the government. Implementing a single window clearance system to streamline project approvals will reduce delays and increase efficiency. We also hope for increased investment in urban infrastructure, such as roads, water supply, and sewage systems, alongside affordable housing schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) to support new housing developments. Incentives for green building practices and smart city initiatives are anticipated to promote sustainable and technologically advanced urban development, enhancing the sector’s long-term appeal and functionality.” Mohit Malhotra, founder & CEO of NeoLiv, said, “As a new-age developer in the growing real estate sector of India, our expectations for the upcoming budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 are framed with a keen understanding of the growing middle income category and its needs for housing requirements. One of the key proposals for the input tax credit under GST is a pivotal requirement for development companies who are pivoting this new era of the sector. Granting developers access to input tax credit is not merely a fiscal incentive; it’s a strategic move that can stimulate the sector’s growth for homebuyers, and fuel economic recovery. In the context of the mid-housing segment, a pivotal focus for us, we look forward creation of new pockets of development with focus on higher budgetary allocation for infrastructure development enabling smooth access to city centres. Mid-range housing projects play a vital role in addressing the housing needs of the middle-income demographic, and we hope that the budget recognises the future potential of this segment.”

Budget 2024 Must Support Waste Management Agencies: Sachin Sharma, founder and director of GEM Enviro Management Sachin Sharma, founder and director of GEM Enviro Management Ltd, said, said, “Building on the momentum of last year’s Budget, which prioritised green growth, the upcoming Union Budget presents a significant opportunity to further strengthen India’s waste management infrastructure. However, significant challenges remain. Inadequate waste collection infrastructure and inefficient sorting and recycling systems continue to hinder progress. Valuable materials are still being discarded in landfills instead of being diverted for reuse.” To truly advance India’s circular economy goals, the government must encourage and support waste management agencies that are diligently working in this field. Additionally, streamlining the supply chain for e-waste and plastic waste is essential. This will foster a robust ecosystem where manufacturers, industry players, and recyclers can collaborate more effectively. While Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and the Waste Management Rules of 2016 have had a positive impact, more impactful compliance is needed to achieve truly meaningful results, he added.

Budget 2024 Expectations from Edtech Sector Akshay Munjal, founder and CEO of Hero Vired, said, “In the past decade, the government has embarked on a transformative journey, introducing major reforms and initiatives in education and skill development. As we aspire to realise our vision of a $5 trillion economy, it is crucial that education, health, and skill development remain at the forefront of our national agenda in the upcoming Budget. Developing a strong tech infrastructure is critical for fueling growth and job creation in high-demand sectors like AI, cybersecurity, and big data. Our policies must equip our workforce with essential digital skills and technologies, enabling India to spearhead global advancements.” By embracing research-driven skill development tailored to job creation, we can elevate the effectiveness of our education sector.Implementing a regulatory framework for EdTech should also be evaluated as it can bring organization, transparency, and efficiency to the sector, benefiting all stakeholders involved. T By adopting these measures, we can strengthen our education system holistically and position India as a global leader in digital skills, knowledge and technological innovation, he added.

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Anand Roy, MD & CEO, Star Health Insurance wants the GST for the insurance sector to be reduced “The upcoming Indian Budget 2024-25 offers a crucial opportunity to address long-standing issues in the health insurance sector. We look forward to measures to enhance access and affordability of health insurance. Reducing the GST on health insurance below 18% is imperative, as it should not be taxed higher than luxury goods. Health insurance for senior citizens should be taxed at the lowest possible rate. Additionally, we advocate for: increasing the tax deduction limit under Section 80D to Rs 50,000 for individuals under 60 years and Rs 75,000 for the elderly. Including personal accident policies under Section 80D and extending these benefits to the new tax regime would provide significant financial relief, promoting wider adoption of comprehensive insurance plans. Establishing a healthcare regulator with oversight and governance over the hospital ecosystem is essential to developing a robust digital health infrastructure that facilitates affordable healthcare delivery,” said Anand Roy

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Aviation sector wants ATF under GST Kanika Tekriwal, Founder & CEO, JetSetGo, said ‘’With an optimistic outlook for India in the global aviation market, we expect the newly formed government to provide a customs exemption for Non-Scheduled Operators, akin to the exemptions already available for scheduled air operations. This step would streamline the import process and level the playing field, allowing NSOs to operate more competitively and efficiently. The current tax structure on aviation fuel increases the overall operating cost for everybody in the aviation industry, particularly affecting NSOs operating on tighter margins than larger scheduled airlines. Bringing aviation fuel under the GST regime would result in a more rationalized and lower tax incidence, thus significantly reducing operational costs. This change would enhance the overall efficiency of our operations, leading to more cost-effective services for our customers. If the upcoming budget supports these expectations the growth and sustainability of the private jet and aviation industry will become more efficient, reliable, and affordable, contributing positively to the broader aviation sector and the economy.’’

news18.com,"Budget 2024 Stock Picks: Axis Securities Bets On Hero MotoCorp, Nestle, UltraTech And More","The upcoming budget is expected to strike a good balance between fiscal consolidation, growth, and rural welfare schemes, supported by the RBI’s higher-than-expected dividend transfer.

Given the resilience of the Indian economy, the focus would remain on quality spending by increasing the outlay for capital expenditure to sustain healthy growth.

As the first full-year Budget following the formation of the NDA 3.0 government, market participants are keenly observing its potential effects on the Indian economy and market. Brokerage house Axis Securities believes, at the current juncture, the Budget will likely strengthen the narrative of “Viksit Bharat” by 2047, following a transformation similar to the one witnessed in the last decade.

Naveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer at Axis Securities PMS, said: “After the formation of the NDA 3.0 government, expectations from the market are growing towards some allocation for the bottom of the pyramid to address rural challenges, alongside some cutoff on Capex spending. We believe that, at the current juncture, the budget is likely to strike a balance between Capex spending and addressing rural challenges. Nonetheless, a higher-than-expected RBI dividend has provided some cushion to move further towards welfare schemes. Currently, the market is keenly watching developments towards the capital gains tax. Any deviation from market expectations could attract some negative reaction in the short term. However, the chances of this occurring appear slim,” said the brokerage.

Recommending stocks for the upcoming Budget, Axis stated that its positive play (in coverage) includes Hero MotoCorp, UltraTech Cement, Nestle, NTPC, Praj Industries, Inox Wind, J Kumar Infra, Ahluwalia Contracts, and V-Mart. Meanwhile, among stocks not under its coverage, Axis favors M&M for its rural play, Power Grid for its power transmission Capex, Va Tech Wabag for the sustainable water theme, Bharat Electronics for the indigenisation of the defence sector, and Sarvotech Power for the EV charging station theme.

Sector-wise Expectations

BFSI: Axis anticipates that this Budget will continue to emphasise capital expenditure (Capex), with a focus on power and renewable energy, leading to higher allocation and an increased number of schemes in this sector. Additionally, it expects clarification regarding the potential privatisation of certain PSU banks, as previously announced by the government. The forthcoming budget may also renew emphasis on housing schemes in rural markets.

Preferred banks for these initiatives include SBI, BoB, CANBK, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank. PFC, REC, and IREDA could also remain in focus, along with PSU banks and rural-focused housing financiers such as Aptus, India Shelter Finance, Aavas, and SFBs pursuing growth in rural areas.

Infrastructure: Axis expects the Union Budget 2024-25 to significantly increase capital outlay for the infrastructure sector to achieve targets set under the National Infrastructure Pipeline and Gati Shakti Master Plan. The focus is anticipated to be on key infrastructure segments such as roads, railways, airports, and urban infrastructure, with a 10-15 percent higher allocation year-over-year for the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways and a similarly increased Budget for railways. Dedicated allocations to larger infrastructure projects like the Jal Jeevan Mission, High-Speed Rail, Smart Cities, and Inland Waterways Development are also expected.

Additionally, there will likely be a focus on developing industrial infrastructure and cleaner energy alternatives. Measures to improve long-term funding availability for the infrastructure sector are anticipated. With the government’s heightened focus on overall infrastructure development, particularly in highways, railways, and urban infrastructure, companies operating in these segments are poised to encounter massive opportunities. Notable stocks include KNR Construction, PNC Infratech, RITES, KEC International, J Kumar Infraprojects, and Ahluwalia Contracts, recommended Axis.

Cement: Axis expects the upcoming Budget to facilitate and expand overall infra development which will positively benefit cement companies with higher demand. Stocks in focus are UltraTech, Ambuja Cements, Dalmia Bharat, JK Cement, JK Lakshmi, and Birla Corp.

Auto & Ancillaries: With the Union Budget 2024-25 being the first after the general elections, the government’s key focus is expected to be on boosting rural consumption. This would support discretionary spending, benefiting rural-focused two-wheelers (2Ws) and entry-level four-wheeler (4W) original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), along with auto ancillary companies supplying to these OEMs, said the brokerage.

The introduction of the FAME-III subsidy from July 2024, with a focus on charging infrastructure, will significantly boost the sector. This initiative, along with support for energy storage systems and R&D for clean energy, green mobility, and semiconductors, will greatly aid the auto sector. Additionally, the reduction and unification of GST rates to 18 percent from the high 28 percent GST rate. The EV industry also anticipates a reduction in GST on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) batteries to align with the 5 percent rate for EVs. Further, a long-term sustainable roadmap in the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) space, particularly focusing on the MSME segment, which forms the backbone of the economy, is crucial.

Positive beneficiaries in this context include Mahindra & Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp for auto OEMs, Minda Corp and Sansera Engineering for auto components, and Servotech Power and Bosch for EV charging infrastructure, it added.

Power: To achieve India’s 500 GW renewable energy target by 2030, reforms like increased viability gap funding for battery storage, offshore wind, and solar are crucial. Public-private partnerships and sustainable financing will support this. The Budget may focus on rooftop solar, Compressed Biogas, Ethanol, and Green Hydrogen, with the National Green Hydrogen Mission likely seeing increased funding. Hydropower and grid stability incentives are anticipated, along with extended ISTS waiver eligibility, said Axis. Infrastructure investment, GST reductions on solar devices, and potential custom-duty cuts on renewables are also expected. Data center growth will drive power demand, benefiting companies like NTPC, CESC, Tata Power, Inox Wind, Suzlon, Sterling & Wilson, and Power Grid.

FMCG: The brokerage expects investments in digital infrastructure, skill development, and MSME support to indirectly stimulate consumption in the economy, particularly in rural areas. It also anticipates schemes to boost agricultural income and rural household finances, including initiatives like the LPG subsidy through PMUY, which are poised to strengthen ahead of upcoming elections. Increased funding for rural infrastructure and connectivity improvements will likely drive consumption. However, proposed excise or NCCD duty hikes on cigarettes and tobacco products may have a negative impact, it added. FMCG companies like Dabur, HUL, Nestle, and Britannia could benefit, along with retailers like Trent and Westlife Foodworld, while companies like ITC, Godfrey Phillip, and VST Industries may face challenges.

Metals: The sector anticipates a boost from increased infrastructure spending and logistics development, alongside potential announcements in housing, manufacturing, and construction, said Axis. Recent trends show India becoming a net steel importer due to competitive pressures from cheap Chinese exports, prompting calls for higher import duties and customs adjustments. The sector also awaits financial incentives for mineral exploration and updates on PLI schemes, especially in green energy transitions. Tax rationalisation on critical raw materials like natural gas and electricity, as well as adjustments in import duties for materials like Ferro-nickel and Ferro-molybdenum, are critical industry demands. Increased Budget allocations for construction and infrastructure could drive domestic steel demand, benefiting stocks such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel, JSPL, SAIL, Hindalco, NALCO, and Jindal Stainless.

Midcaps: In the upcoming Budget, Axis anticipates continued focus on PLI incentives to foster growth in emerging sectors, bolstering the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative aimed at enhancing manufacturing capabilities and boosting exports while managing imports. It expects the government to reinforce its commitment to sustainability through initiatives in renewable energy and alternative technologies, alongside significant investments in infrastructure development across sectors like defence, railways, and roads.

The Budget might also address concerns in the agricultural sector by potentially revising the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane and considering adjustments in sugar MSP or facilitating sugar exports for ethanol production. Additionally, with ambitions to achieve net zero emissions by 2070, the government is likely to announce measures promoting biofuels, including revised ethanol prices, financial aid for machinery procurement, and other initiatives to bolster the biofuel ecosystem, noted Axis.

The Union Budget for FY24-25 is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping India’s economic trajectory. With expectations centered on higher Capex and rural spending, job creation, and fiscal consolidation, the Budget aims to drive growth while maintaining stability.

Budget 2024 Expectation Live: Healthcare Regulatory Reforms Rakesh Kumar, founder, Square Insurance, said, “Increasing the tax exemption limit on health insurance premiums to Rs 75,000 would make healthcare more accessible.” He also suggests, “Introducing subsidies or tax credits for comprehensive electric vehicle (EV) insurance will promote EV adoption.” Kumar advocates for home insurance by stating, “Offering tax deductions for home insurance premiums under Section 80C will encourage homeowners to protect their assets.” To enhance cybersecurity, he notes, “Tax incentives for cyber insurance, particularly for SMEs, are essential.” He emphasises the need to broaden healthcare access, saying, “Expanding the Ayushman Bharat scheme to include the middle class would significantly increase healthcare coverage.” For comprehensive coverage, Kumar adds, “Extending deductions to other personal insurances will promote comprehensive coverage.” He also highlights the microfinance sector, stating, “Introducing parametric covers and mandatory coverage for shops and establishments will enhance resilience for vulnerable groups.” On regulatory reforms, Kumar insists, “Healthcare regulatory reforms, including creating an autonomous regulatory body, establishing a health claims exchange, and streamlining cashless authorizations, are needed to improve oversight and service quality.” For retirement savings, he suggests, “Simplifying or eliminating taxes on pension and annuity products and extending NPS tax exemptions will encourage retirement savings.” Lastly, he proposes, “Comprehensive tax reforms for life insurance, such as allowing complete deductions for premiums, lowering GST on term life insurance, and implementing zero-rating for specific policies, will make life insurance more affordable.”

Budget 2024 Expectation Live: Budgetary Allocation For Climate Action Projects Ankit Mathur, Co-founder, Greenway Grameen, said, “We look forward to specific budgetary allocation for climate action projects. Given the serious effects of climate change, experienced in the form of the recent heat wave, it would be prudent to invest in nature-based, community-driven projects. The government’s excellent work on infrastructure development should be complemented with sincere efforts in climate mitigation and adaptation to build resilience in India’s growth story.”

Budget 2024 Expectation: Agricultural Sector Expectations Raju Kapoor, Director, Industry & Public Affairs, FMC India, “The agricultural sector which is the backbone of the Indian economy has been through a challenging year. With monsoon playing truant, agricultural growth has diminished from 4.7% last year to 1.4%, which further added to the rural distress. This budget presents a crucial opportunity to address these concerns and propel the sector towards a brighter future. The government must prioritize agriculture and rural India, focusing on making farmers more resilient while simultaneously mitigating food inflation that disproportionately affects society’s underprivileged segments. Firstly, the budget must acknowledge the stark reality of food inflation, aggravated by stock restrictions on essential commodities such as pulses, wheat, and rice. This disproportionately affects the most vulnerable sections of society, demanding immediate attention. Similarly, the import dependence on pulses and oilseeds, the government’s commitment to providing free rations under the Annapurna Yojana, and climate change further necessitate a robust domestic production system supported by developing an innovation ecosystem. The government should prioritize R&D investments aligned with national priorities, focusing on developing climate-resilient crop varieties, microbial products, and sustainable farming practices. To facilitate the widespread adoption of technology, the budget should also incentivize the private sector participation in building a robust agricultural innovation ecosystem. Tax incentives for R&D investments by the private sector can encourage the development and integration of cutting-edge technologies. Furthermore, GST on agricultural inputs, such as agrochemicals, should be brought under the GST Council’s purview and potentially lowered to 12% maximum to ease the financial burden on farmers. The Kisan Samridhi Yojana should be strengthened to empower farmers with greater financial support and its utilization at farmers’ hands should be linked to the use of advanced agricultural inputs. Kisan Samruddhi coupons that could be used to purchase agricultural inputs would enhance productivity. This will ensure timely access to essential resources and subsequent financial support to the farmers. We expect that the budget should have adequate resources for capacity-building initiatives, and should incentivize the investments by private companies to train farmer groups, particularly women, creating awareness and adoption of modern growing practices. Easy access to adequate and affordable credit will further empower farmers to be able to adopt these technologies and enhance their livelihoods. Extending the PLI scheme for production and export of latest innovation crop protection chemicals in India will provide long term dividend to India. Similarly, aligned to the theme of making India the Global Drone Hub, expanding the PLI scheme for building the agri-drone component manufacturing ecosystem will go a long way. In a nutshell, we envisage that this budget is focused on agriculture, which will further lay the foundation for a strong, sustainable, and prosperous future for Indian farmers and the nation.”

Budget 2024 Expectation: Credit Access To MSMEs On Budget Wishlist Shaji Varghese, CEO of Muthoot Fincorp Limited, said: “We hope to see new initiatives for enhancing access to credit among MSMEs, especially in the rural areas in this upcoming budget. More liquidity assistance to NBFCs, and credit guarantee to MSME lending can help enhance supply of credit . We anticipate continued budget allocations towards digital initiatives and technologies. Financial inclusion is a significant enabler for Viksit Bharat 2047 and while NBFCs are focused on the same, we expect the government to take some measures to increase credit supply there by enabling the SMEs and rural business development, thus contributing to nation’s growth.”

Union Budget 2024 Expectation: Will Budget 2024 Have Incentives For The Banking Sector Ramki Gaddipati, CEO APAC and Global CTO, Zeta, said, “India already boasts of some of the most impressive Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and payment rails today including ground-breaking new protocols such as Credit Line on UPI. As a provider of next-generation banking solutions to large financial institutions, we hope that the Union Budget 24-25 will introduce further imperatives and incentives for banks and the associated technology ecosystem to create even more financial inclusion for the underserved Indians.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: 'Prioritize Growth Of Digital Payments' Suresh Rajagopalan, CEO- Wibmo, a PayU company, said, “As we approach the upcoming budget, it is crucial to prioritize the growth of digital payments through enhanced security measures and the establishment of a fraud data consortium. With the rapid expansion of digital payments, substantial resources must be allocated to fortify security infrastructure, ensuring that consumers and businesses can engage in transactions with confidence. The creation of a fraud data consortium would enable financial institutions and payment service providers to share information about fraudulent activities, fostering a collaborative effort to combat fraud.”

Budget 2024 Expectation: Renewable Energy Sector Wishlist “With climate change as a key global concern, we believe the green energy charter will be on priority in the upcoming union budget 2024 as India currently at 150 GW has set an ambitious target of achieving a renewable energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030. Further, with a focus on ‘Make in India’, and improving ease of doing business, India has become one of the preferred destinations for global companies and is on the road to becoming the third third-largest economy in the world with a GDP of $5 trillion making green energy a top focus to achieve its Net Zero goals. PM Narendra Modi’s recent address in Russia underlined India’s commitment to renewable energy. In fact, the Government’s focus has been clear with the recent progressive policy and regulatory reforms such as ALMM, PLI scheme, PM Surya Ghar, PM Suryoday Yojana and more. To further shape the renewable energy sector, the government must focus on large-scale investments in domestic solar panel and component manufacturing facilities. This will not only shorten supply chains and reduce dependency on imports, but also create a cost-competitive advantage. Introducing new skill development programs, incentives, funding, import duties, subsidies, and crafting favourable policies that can boost R&D and innovation will further bolster the sector. We also recommend allocating the unutilized PLI funds towards smaller companies that meet specified criteria to support their entry into module and component manufacturing. This strategic distribution is crucial for boosting the capabilities of MSMEs in the renewable energy sector. Apart from this, budgetary allocations should address the growing need for support towards energy storage projects,” Capt Ishver Dholakiya, Founder and MD, Goldi Solar.

Budget 2024 Expectation: New scheme for domestic medical device manufacturing likely in Union Budget 2024 The Union Budget is expected to introduce a scheme aimed at boosting the domestic manufacturing of medical devices, similar to existing initiatives for drugmakers, as reported by Mint. This move is intended to promote self-reliance in medical equipment and reduce healthcare costs. Although the specifics of financial support are yet to be finalized, discussions about including this initiative in the 2024-25 Budget are ongoing.

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: 'Treating Crypto At Par With Other Financial Assets' Amjad Raza Khan, CEO, Cashaa, said, “Rationalisation of capital gains tax down from the current 30% and of the TDS tax rate of 1%. Treating crypto at par with other financial asset classes like equity. A well-defined regulatory framework for crypto in the country, making crypto a suitable investment option for the common man as well as spurring industry investment in the crypto sector.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Rationalise Customs Duties In Various Sectors The Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has suggested the government to rationalise customs duties in various sectors including steel, solar battery, aluminum, and lithium cells in a bid to boost domestic manufacturing. ICC President Ameya Prabhu said protective measures are needed for the growth of domestic industry in sectors including steel, solar battery, aluminum, and lithium cells.

Most experts think the final budget will stick to the targets set in February, with a fiscal deficit of 5.10% of GDP and borrowing of 14.13 trillion rupees. The government will use a large payment from the Reserve Bank of India for extra spending, while also trying to manage financial demands from political allies and maintain fiscal discipline.

Therefore, taxpayers are hopeful for some changes this time.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/budget-2024-expectations-live-updates-expected-key-changes-income-tax-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-gst-latest-news-18-july-2024-liveblog-8969627.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Affordable Healthcare, Subsidies On Check-ups, GST Relief Key Demands","Union Budget 2024: The budget is expected to address affordability, accessibility, and healthcare quality in India. We’ll have to wait until the official announcement on July 23rd to see the specific measures outlined by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

The Indian healthcare sector has high expectations from the upcoming Budget 2024.

Industry leaders are urging the government to increase allocation for healthcare. This would significantly boost public health initiatives, infrastructure development, and medical research resources. Experts anticipate tax incentives to be announced. This could include tax breaks for healthcare providers or insurance companies to make healthcare more affordable.

Need For Increased Budget Allocation

P N Arora, Chairman, Yashoda Super Speciality Hospitals Kaushambi, said, “A critical aspect of the healthcare demands revolves around accessibility and affordability. The sector advocates for subsidies or free health check-ups, especially for women and children, aiming to improve preventive care and early detection of diseases.”

In addition, there is a push for incentives and support for domestic manufacturing of medical devices to reduce reliance on imports and align with the ‘Make in India’ campaign, Arora added.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer are a major health concern in India. There is a need for increased budget allocation to prevent, treat, and manage NCDs, including supporting research, public awareness campaigns, and making treatment options more accessible.

Re-skilling Healthcare Workers

Arora highlighted that the sector also emphasises the importance of training and re-skilling healthcare workers to meet evolving healthcare demands with new technologies.

Regarding health insurance, Arora said stakeholders are seeking fiscal reforms to create a more inclusive and sustainable health coverage model.

It involves revisiting GST tariffs on healthcare services and products to ensure affordability and accessibility across all socioeconomic segments. Additionally, there is a call for insurance coverage for preventive healthcare measures, not just reactive medical treatments, Arora added.

Benefits of Increased Healthcare Budget

Jasdeep Singh, Group CEO, CARE Hospitals Group, also urged the government to consider enhancing the budget for the healthcare industry.

“The increased budget allocations can improve accessibility and affordability to people not just in Tier I cities, but also in Tier II and Tier III cities. Simplifying and making fairer taxes, specifically reforming GST, can contribute to this goal,” Singh added.

Improving Infrastructure

Singh believes there is a critical need for focused attention on hospital infrastructure.

“While hospitals delivered essential and high-quality treatment during the pandemic, the prevailing circumstances underscored facility inadequacies, particularly a glaring shortage of beds and treatment options, especially in non-metro cities. Consequently, the government must prioritise enhancing infrastructure, especially in non-metro areas, ensuring that individuals can readily access healthcare when required,” Singh underlined.

Door-to-door Eye Screening Initiatives

Rajat Goel, Co-founder & CEO of Eye-Q Super Speciality Eye Hospitals, said, “With 62 million visually impaired persons and 8 million blind people, India bears approximately a quarter of the world’s burden of blindness and vision impairment. We eagerly anticipate the upcoming Budget 2024-25, hoping for transformative policies that tackle these pressing issues.”

Goel strongly advocated for large-scale door-to-door eye screening initiatives essential for early detection and treatment. Additionally, the backlog of eye surgeries, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, urgently requires resolution, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare remains limited.

Infrastructure Boost

“We also look forward to an infrastructure boost that will enhance the capacity of eye care facilities nationwide. Furthermore, support for research and development is crucial to advancing innovative treatments and technologies in eye care,” Goel added.

Lowering GST and other import taxes on medical equipment and supplies would significantly reduce costs, making eye care more accessible and affordable. With these measures, “we believe the budget can pave the way for a brighter, clearer future for millions of individuals, ensuring that quality eye care is within reach for all.”

Emergency Services

Pranav Bajaj, CEO, Medulance, said, “The budget is a pivotal opportunity to fortify India’s emergency services. We urge the government to prioritise strategic investments in these areas to improve response times and overall emergency medical care efficacy. A key expectation is the revision of the GST structure for ambulance procurement. Currently burdened with a 28% GST, we propose a significant reduction to 0%. This move not only alleviates financial constraints but also incentivizes the nationwide enhancement of emergency fleets, contributing to faster and more effective emergency response.”",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/budget-2024-expectations-healthcare-sector-modi-3-0-8970127.html
news18.com,"Union Budget 2024: Expectations, Date, Time, Where to Watch, Key Facts, Here's All You Need to Know","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the full Budget 2024-25 next week, on July 23, Tuesday. This will be the first Budget of the Modi 3.0 government and her seventh Budget presentation. The Budget is expected to push initiatives for various segments of the economy in line with the Viksit Bharat 2047 Vision, along with maintaining its fiscal prudence. Check the date, time, key facts and expectations from the Union Budget 2024-25, and where to watch:

Date and Timings of the Union Budget 2024-25 Presentations

The full Union Budget 2024-25 is going to be presented on July 23 in the Lok Sabha. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will start her Budget Speech at 11 am. This will be Sitharaman’s seventh Budget Speech in a row, making her India’s second finance minister to do so.

Where Can You Watch the Union Budget 2024-25 Live Stream?

The Union Budget 2024 will be live-streamed across platforms. It can be watched live on CNN-News18 and News18 TV channels, along with in-depth analysis.

Apart from this, the Budget Speech live-streaming and broadcast will be done on the India Budget’s website, Sansad TV and Doordarshan TV channels and their YouTube channels.

The duration of the Budget Speech depends upon the length of the Budget. Among Sitharaman’s six Budget Speeches so far, the Budget Speech 2020 was the longest which continued for 2 hours and 40 minutes. It was also India’s longest Budget Speech. Her shortest Budget Speech was in Interim Budget 2024, at 56 minutes.

The shortest Budget Speech in India was delivered by Hirubhai M Patel, who presented an 800-word interim budget for 1977-78.

When Was India’s First Budget Presented?

James Wilson, who also introduced income tax, presented India’s first Union Budget on April 7, 1860. In Independent India, the first Union Budget was presented on November 26, 1947, by the first finance minister R K Shanmukham Chetty.

Who Has Presented The Most Number of Budgets?

So far, C D Deshmukh, who was India’s finance minister between 1950 and 1956, has presented the highest number of Union Budget. He presented seven Budgets, including an interim one in 1952.

Nirmala Sitharaman will become the second finance minister to achieve this. She is also one of the longest-serving finance ministers of India.

Full Budget Vs Interim Budget Vs Vote-on-Account

The full Union Budget covers the receipts and expenditures of the entire year, while an interim Budget is for a shorter period. The interim budget is typically presented in an election year, when the government does not have a full year ahead.

Under Article 112 of the Constitution of India, the Budget is called ‘Annual Financial Statement’.

Vote on account, on the other hand, is envisaged under Article 116, which covers the government’s short-term expenditure, as the Appropriation Bill (through which the government can withdraw budgeted money from the Consolidated Fund of India) might take time to pass in Parliament.

Budget 2024-25: Major Expectations

Various sections of society have a lot of expectations from the Budget 2024-25, ranging from income tax relief to measures to push growth. India’s tax slabs have remained unchanged since 2012-13.

On the fiscal consolidation front, the government is likely to reduce its fiscal deficit target to 5 per cent in the full Budget 2024-25, against 5.1 per cent in the interim Budget. This comes following a surge in tax collections and a higher-than-expected surplus transfer of Rs 2.1 lakh crore from the RBI.

“Since this is the first budget in the Modi Government’s historical third term, it will be leveraged to send the message of economic vision for 2030 and 2047. As part of this, the Modi Government may deploy the 0.33 per cent available fiscal space created by higher than budgeted surplus transfer from RBI towards pro-growth areas like higher allocations for RoDTEP, marginal increase in capital expenditure, tax cuts, tax incentives, rural development, incentives for affordable housing, incentivising states to promote manufacturing and MSMEs or others that the government may deem fit. A part of the spend may be directed towards education and healthcare,” said Sandeep Vempati, an economist with BJP.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/budget-2024-date-time-where-to-watch-key-facts-expectations-8968814.html

Budget 2024 Expectations on Taxation Harsh Punjabee, founder and CEO of SMEST Capital, said, “As the Union Budget 2024 approaches, we can anticipate significant tax reforms that simplify the current structure. Increasing the basic exemption limit and providing more tax-saving investment options will help individuals better manage their personal finances. Also, with the rise of digital finance, there is an expectation for the budget to promote digital financial inclusion. This could involve incentives for digital payments and investments in technology infrastructure to make financial services more accessible. Citizens are looking forward to budget provisions that ease their financial burden. Expectations include higher tax deductions for essential expenses such as education, healthcare, and housing. These reforms will play a crucial role in helping people manage their finances more effectively, leading to a more stable and prosperous economic environment.”

Budget 2024 Expectations: YES Bank CEO Prashant Kumar Shares 8 Key Areas to Focus Prashant Kumar, MD & CEO of YES Bank, said, “The Union Budget 2024 is expected to play a crucial role in shaping India’s economic future. This is especially true as the tax revenue collections have remained robust and the government is also armed with a bumper dividend from the RBI. The government is expected to remain committed to the reforms process and be focused on eight key areas: Sustainable growth, financial sector, infrastructure and investment, women, youth & farmers, last-mile connectivity, inclusive development, and economic expansion – all essential towards achieving ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047.” The government has exhibited its commitment towards fiscal discipline, much necessary to signal economic stability and build investor confidence. However, the government is also expected to balance this objective together with the needs for economic growth and providing adequate outlays for key social sector programs, in an effort towards inclusive growth and ensure that the benefits of economic development reach all segments of society. In this context the government is likely to lay stress on ensuring skill developments, focus on enhancing the strength of the manufacturing sector via sharpening the PLI scheme and provide adequate support for small business to grow, he added. “At YES BANK, we are prepared to support the government’s push for enhancing digital infrastructure and promoting financial inclusion. This aligns with our commitment to bringing advanced banking services to underserved regions and supporting initiatives in green mobility, affordable housing, healthcare, and education. These efforts will not only spur economic growth but also ensure holistic development,” Kumar said. He also said he is particularly excited about growth in manufacturing and support for MSMEs, which are vital for job creation and economic dynamism.

Budget Expectations from Real Estate Sector B K Malagi, COO at Experion Developers, said, “We believe that the forthcoming budget will address the main issues facing the real estate industry, especially by giving homebuyers tax relief and expanding the deduction for house loan interest. Reforms aimed at increasing the availability of affordable housing, such as better financing for housing projects and expedited approval procedures, are also essential. Further stimulating growth will be providing incentives for sustainable development and improving infrastructure in developing metropolitan areas. All things considered, these policies will not only stimulate the housing market but also increase the number of people who can become homeowners.”

Budget Expectations from Healthcare Sector Girish Agarwal, co-founder of Zeno Health, said, “While the government has increased healthcare expenditure in recent years, it remains lower compared to neighboring countries like Bangladesh and Bhutan. According to the National Health Policy 2017, the government aims to raise healthcare spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2025. To achieve this, increased allocation toward technology integration in public healthcare systems is crucial. Given our large population, collaboration with organizations and startups can improve distribution and monitoring of healthcare services. These technological advancements can benefit services delivered through the ASHA network, government hospitals, primary health centers, ambulance services, and insurance delivery.” Despite government schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana (PMJAY), access to generic medicines remains limited in India. Two factors contribute to this limitation: quality control at the source and the lack of prescription law enforcement. To address this, the government should enforce a law requiring doctors’ prescriptions to include drug names rather than specific brands. Such a change would enhance transparency and directly benefit consumers, he added. “We hope that during the upcoming Budget session, the government will prioritize these initiatives, as they hold significant promise for future generations,” Agarwal added.

Budget 2024 Expectations from Hospitality Sector Pranav Dangi, founder & CEO of The Hosteller, said, “As an Indian hostel chain owner, I am hopeful that the upcoming Union Budget will provide much-needed support and relief to the hospitality sector. Key expectations are: * Tax incentives, such as reduced GST rates and investment-linked deductions, to help the industry recover from pandemic-induced losses. * Easier access to affordable credit to facilitate infrastructure upgrades, expansion, and working capital requirements. * Policies that boost domestic tourism, including incentives for young travellers and students to explore India, which can significantly benefit the hostel industry. * Improved connectivity through investments in transportation infrastructure, enhancing accessibility to tourist destinations. * Subsidies and incentives to encourage the adoption of sustainable practices, such as renewable energy and eco-friendly operations, in the hospitality sector.

Budget 2024 Expectations from Fintech Sector Karan Desai, founder of Interface Ventures, said, “The Indian fintech industry is looking forward to a Union Budget that will continue building on the development of digital infrastructure across the entire financial services ecosystem. Digital India has been a pet project of the government and in their 3rd term, expectations are that even more investment will go into driving this revolution.”

Budget 2024 Expectations: Healthcare Need of Senior Citizens Neha Sinha, Co-founder and CEO, Epoch Elder Care The Budget for fiscal year 2024-25 is important for the health industry, especially for the overall health of our senior citizens, who deserve more dedicated attention as they strive for self-sufficiency, aiming to manage their daily lives independently and with dignity. We look forward to the proposed extension of Ayushman Bharat, wherein all the elderly above 70 years of age will also be covered and will get the benefit of free treatment under this Yojana. This proposed expansion will provide much-needed financial security and access to quality healthcare services for the elderly. The budget should focus on addressing the shortage of healthcare professionals, and further incorporation of technology into healthcare services, with special emphasis on tele-medicines, which will give impetus to improving service delivery and accessibility, benefitting the seniors in our country. The budget should also look at allocating sufficient funds for care and counseling required for combating the rising health burdens of dementia, Parkinson’s, and other neurological diseases that are mostly prevalent among the elderly in India. As we await the budget announcement, we are hopeful that the government’s allocations will portray a comprehensive approach to providing the required support to senior citizens, including several components such as healthcare, social security, and mobility needs.

Budget 2024 Expectations on Cybersecurity Infra Trishneet Arora, founder and CEO of TAC InfoSec, said, “As we approach the Indian Union pre-budget, it is crucial to bolster our cybersecurity infrastructure. The evolving digital threats demand robust support and incentives for the cybersecurity sector. I urge the government to prioritise investments in infrastructure, advanced training, and innovation in cybersecurity. Strengthening our cybersecurity framework will protect national interests and enhance India’s global reputation in digital security. Robust cybersecurity measures are essential for fostering cross-border trust, enabling secure international collaborations and trade. By positioning India as a leader in cybersecurity, we can build a resilient digital ecosystem that benefits both our nation and the global community.” With the Union Budget 2024 on the horizon, we anticipate a strong government focus on cybersecurity, data privacy, and responsible AI development. The Data Protection Data Privacy (DPDP) Bill and new legislation on deep fakes are commendable steps forward, he added. “We urge increased investment in cybersecurity infrastructure and human capital development. With cyber threats escalating, it’s vital to educate businesses and government entities about risks and provide cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions and skilled professionals. The budget should prioritize funding for educational and training programmes to build expertise in AI and cybersecurity,” Arora added. Umesh Kumar Sahay, Managing Director NES Data, said, “With a stable union government in the saddle there are expectations for the budget to include incentives for creating critical infrastructure, such as data centres, which are crucial for national security. The rapid increase in the use of Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing technologies, is leading to a significant demand for server space and data centres. Budgetary support would help meet this industry demand more swiftly.”

Date and Timing of the Union Budget 2024-25 Presentations The full Union Budget 2024-25 is going to be presented on July 23 in the Lok Sabha.

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Healthcare Needs Attention Dr. Sanjeev Singh, Medical Director, Amrita Hospital, Faridabad, said, “As the nation eagerly anticipates the upcoming budget, the health sector remains a focal point of discussion. The health sector is not just a critical component of public welfare but also a significant contributor to the nation’s GDP. Currently, the healthcare sector contributes approximately 1.7% to the GDP.” “With strategic investments and reforms, this contribution can be significantly increased. The budget should aim to elevate the healthcare sector’s GDP contribution to around 5% over the next few years.”

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Gold Loan NBFCs Wishlist As a prominent player in this sector, we would like to continue to advocate to provide cushion and offer maximum benefit to customers by urging the government to grant eligible gold loan NBFCs with ‘priority sector status’. We believe that providing priority sector status to eligible gold loans NBFCs will be a step forward in driving financial inclusion as it majorly impacts the small borrowers whose borrowing needs are frequently less than Rs 50,000. We also propose for a ‘Gold linked credit line via UPI’ that can go a long way in helping households/small business owners meet their financing needs and monetise idle gold jewellery. Once the NBFCs are allowed to link with the UPI payment system, this will act as a secured credit that would be extended by NBFCs at a lower interest rate (12%-18%) compared to the high interest rates (around 36%) charged by credit cards.We further seek a level playing field by bridging the disparity and aligning the single counterparty exposure limits for gold loan NBFCs in comparison with other NBFCs i.e. 20% of Tier-1 capital. This restriction impacts the ability to lend credit and negatively impacts our potential customers.

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Amrit Kiran Singh On Online Gaming Sector Increased GST on Online Games has created a huge tax arbitrage that is inadvertently giving the 500 million players a huge Indian market to foreign ( primarily Chinese) companies at the expense of Indian companies. Would expect FM to address the anomaly in the budget. First by announcing an in-depth study of the pros and cons of this industry and then determining the appropriate level of taxation. And secondly, in the interim, restoring taxes to pre-October levels to stop the hemorrhage of Indian companies. Addiction and other negatives can adequately be addressed through application of smart tech.

Union Budget 2024 Expectation: MSME Wishlist Subash Vasudevan, CBO and Co-founder, iBUS Networks, “The upcoming Union Budget presents a critical juncture to catalyze India’s economic growth and competitiveness. For MSMEs, it is important to preserve favorable payment terms. The quicker receipt of accounts receivable is beneficial and can be further explored & accelerated. It is essential to implement measures that enhance the MSME ecosystem by extending credit facilities and increasing the overall credit available relative to the company’s net worth. Given India’s ongoing development and investment in digital infrastructure like payment gateways, it would be good to have policies designating digital infrastructure as an essential service to accelerate digital transformation. This would help reduce barriers to deploying mobile internet or fixed lines, such as exorbitant rentals for public or private property, and ensure affordable internet access for all. Additionally, targeted incentives for sustainable practices in the power-intensive telecom sector and a more favorable tax regime for ESOPs are essential to foster innovation and attract top talent.”

Budget 2024 Expectations from Steel Sector Budget 2024 Expectations LIVE: Ram Agarwal, CEO of Goodluck India Ltd, said, “Engineering steel products play a significant role in the Indian steel industry, driven by pivotal government projects that accelerate growth. As we enter Modi 3, sustaining the robust growth trajectory witnessed during Modi 1 & 2 is paramount. Crucial infrastructure projects in railways, roads, and cutting-edge advancements in Defence, aerospace, and space industries, coupled with investments in renewable energies like solar and green hydrogen, are imperative for our nation’s sustainable development.” Our industry is prepared to work closely with the Government to capitalise on these opportunities. World is looking to us to partner in global projects like metro rails, and continents connecting projects as well, he added.

Budget 2024: 14 Provisions in IBC, Companies Act, Competition Act, May Be Decriminalised Budget 2024 LIVE Updates: In Budget 2024, the government is likely to decriminalise 14 provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, Competition Act, 2002, and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. These Acts fall under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. “The Companies Act, IBC, and CCI Act under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs are being considered for decriminalisation of some provisions.

news18.com,Budget 2024: Halwa Ceremony Held To Mark Final Stage of Budget Preparation Process,"The Halwa ceremony, marking the final stage of the Budget preparation process for Union Budget 2024, was held in North Block in New Delhi on July 16. It was held in the presence of Union Finance & Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Union Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary.

A customary Halwa ceremony is performed every year before the “lock-in” process of Budget preparation begins.

The final stage of the Budget preparation process for Union Budget 2024-25 commenced with the customary Halwa ceremony in the presence of Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. @nsitharaman, in New Delhi, today. (1/4) pic.twitter.com/X1ywbQx70A— Ministry of Finance (@FinMinIndia) July 16, 2024

The Halwa ceremony was also attended by MoS Finance Pankaj Chaudhary along with secretaries of the finance ministry, CBDT Chairman and CBIC Chairman, besides officials of the finance ministry and North Block Budget Press.

Paperless Budget

Like the previous three full Union Budgets and the Interim Budget 2024, the full Union Budget 2024-25 will also be delivered in paperless form.

All You Need To Know About Halwa Ceremony

Halwa ceremony: It is a kind of a ‘send-off’ for finance ministry officials and staff involved in the preparation of the Union government’s annual financial statement. They enter what is called a ‘lock-in’ period, during which they stay in the basement of North Block, cut off from the world outside with a view to maintaining the secrecy around the final budget document.

They will emerge only after the finance minister completes her Budget speech in the Lok Sabha. It is considered a gesture of appreciation for those who have worked on the Budget. The basement of North Block houses a printing press that was traditionally used to print budget documents for 40 years from 1980 to 2020.

Thereafter, the budget went digital with bare minimum documents printed and the bulk distribution happening via mobile app or on the website. Going digital also meant that the lock-in period has become shorter to just five days from the previous one which lasted up to two weeks.

Printing Press: All Budget-related documents are printed at North Block itself using a dedicated government press. Earlier, the documents were printed at Rashtrapati Bhavan, but this was shifted to a press on Minto Road in the national capital in 1950 after documents were leaked, and in 1980 to North Block. The printing of several hundred copies of the voluminous budget documents was such an elaborate exercise that printing staff had to be quarantined inside the printing press in the basement of North Block for up to two weeks.

Tradition: While the Narendra Modi government has done away with several traditional aspects of the Budget since coming to power in 2014, such as merging the Rail Budget with the main Budget, bringing forward the date of presentation to February 1 instead of the last date of that month, and moving to a digital format — the ‘halwa’ ceremony as a tradition has survived.

Union Budget Mobile App

All the Budget documents, including the Annual Financial Statement (commonly known as Budget), Demand for Grants (DG), Finance Bill etc. as prescribed by the Constitution, will available on the “Union Budget Mobile App” for hassle-free access of Budget documents by Members of Parliament (MPs) and the general public using the simplest form of digital convenience.

How To Download Union Budget Mobile App?

It is bilingual (English & Hindi) and will be available on both Android and iOS platforms. The app can also be downloaded from the Union Budget Web Portal (www.indiabudget.gov.in).

The Budget documents will be available on the mobile app after the completion of the Budget speech by the Finance Minister in Parliament.

news18.com,"Budget 2024: Subsidies On Green Energy, Tax Benefits On MSMEs Wishlist From FM Sitharaman","MSMEs, making up an impressive 97.7% of all enterprises in the country are the backbone of the Indian economy and tomorrow’s large business houses. It accounts for nearly 32% of India’s GDP and is the second largest employer after agriculture, particularly in the semi-urban and rural areas. Within the broad gambit of the MSME sector, Microenterprises constitute nearly 96% of overall MSME units.

Optimising the performance of MSMEs is, therefore, a critical need in the economy. They should be motivated to upgrade technology, adopt ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) best practices, and standardise products to enhance their global competitiveness.

However, many challenges stand in the way of the greening of MSMEs. Among the most critical are: lack of financial literacy coupled with lack of access to finance for technology upgradation, and absence of mentoring and handholding for sustainability and growth. These roadblocks are even greater for micro-units, especially those promoted by women, SC/ST, and other marginalised communities who face real-time challenges to adopting ESG practices. They are often unaware of environmental laws. Moreover, increasing production costs of ‘green’ products often lead to higher prices, which consumers are often loath to pay.

Solutions for Micro Enterprises to Turn Green

The major areas in which MSMEs can make a huge difference are in increasing energy efficiency. Budgetary measures for the push of energy-efficient equipment or installations for alternative sources of energy—solar or wind—are essential. These shall reduce energy consumption and cut down on operational costs, making MSMEs more competitive.

A combination of debt and equity instruments must be used to bring MSMEs, particularly the micro sector, within the fold of the formal financial sector. Venture capital should focus on sectors where the MSMEs function and offer them funding to use green technologies in trade, manufacturing, and services. Policy interventions should focus on improving access to finance for green projects through dedicated schemes of green financing or subsidised interest rates for ESG investments or incentivising banks/financial institutions to prioritise lending to sustainable micro-enterprises.

Similarly, capacity building programmes for skill and entrepreneurship development as well as participation in domestic and overseas events and exhibitions should be increased substantially for the micro sector.

Expectations from the Budget

Micro enterprises have high hopes from the union budget to incentivise them to go green. Subsidies on renewable sources of energy, energy-efficient equipment, or waste reduction technologies—this could be a carry-on of available policies and programmes, including the Credit Linked Capital Subsidy for Technology Upgradation Scheme (CLCSS) and/or interest subvention.

The Ministry of MSME must ensure, through regular monitoring that the MSME Technology Centres at 14 locations across India are functional round-the-year and these centers should assist micro-enterprises proactively.

Tax benefits for companies engaged in developing sustainability-oriented initiatives are also expected. Government incentivised and subsidised loans to facilitate investments in green technologies with lower interest rates. Programs for skills development and capacity building to enable micro-enterprises to learn and acquire skills to sustainably improve their operations. Because consumers pick branded green products over those from micro-enterprises, the latter can become a supplier for the bigger brands.

More rigorous enforcement of the already enacted laws on the compulsory installation of effluent treatment plants and stipulated discharge standards will minimise environmental degradation. Such awareness campaigns can be conducted for entrepreneurs to make them aware of sustainable practices and related prevalent regulations.

In essence, Indian MSMEs, especially those in rural areas, must embrace these environmentally friendly technologies and strategies to lead the way in sustainable development. By combining these regulations with some of the budgetary measures proposed herein, the Government will be in a position to establish a strong system that rewards and compels the MSME sector to work sustainably.

news18.com,From Consumption lift To Infra Boost: Budget 2024 Likely To Be Focused On These 5 Themes,"Union Budget 2024 Key Focus Areas: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is slated to present her seventh Budget on July 23. This will be the first full budget under the Modi-led NDA government. It will be seen as a platform for the Modi government to showcase how it plans to manage allies’ new financial demands and establish its vision and reform agenda for the next five years. Most brokerages expect the Budget to signal policy continuity and a strong focus on fiscal consolidation.

“We expect the government to lower its FY25 fiscal deficit target to 5% of GDP from 5.1% set in the interim budget. From a signaling perspective, there is an incentive for the government to project stability and an uncompromising focus on fiscal consolidation, despite the weaker political mandate,” Nomura analysts Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi said in a note.

Nomura India said the BJP lost its majority and is now reliant on state-level coalition partners, notably the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) from Andhra Pradesh and the Janata Dal (United) (JD(U)) from Bihar. Still, it expects the government to lower its FY25 fiscal deficit target to 5 per cent of GDP from 5.1 per cent set in the interim budget. Incorporating the financial demands of the two allies, it expects a 0.2 per cent of GDP rise in total expenditure, as compared to the interim budget target. It expects the government to stick to the tax revenue growth projections made during the interim budget, albeit on the provisional FY24 data.

It identified five potential themes that may emerge prominently in the FY25 budget. They are:

Consumption lift

Nomura citing media reports said the government may look to boost consumer demand by raising the standard deduction limit for taxpayers under the ‘new’ tax regime (alternate regime introduced with no exemptions but lower tax rates) and possibly increase the exemption on income from bank interest.

Other measures may include lowering the personal income tax rate for those in the Rs 5-15 lakh tax slab, costing the exchequer Rs 25,000 crore (0.08 per cent of GDP), and a similar amount could be spent by increasing the annual cash handout to farmers from the current Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000.

Social sector focus

The government is likely to increase the outlay on rural sector schemes, with subsidies for housing to be increased by Rs 23,000 crore (0.07 per centr of GDP) as well as increased outlays for rural roads and employment. There are also reports of an expansion of the public health insurance programme by Rs 12,100 crore (0.04 per cent of GDP and a renewal of the economic empowerment programme for women(Lakhpati Didi), it said.

Manufacturing boost

Nomura India expects the government to maintain its focus on promoting domestic manufacturing. The budget could announce an increase in the minimum local content requirement for public procurement, revive the concessional corporate tax rate of 15 per cent for new manufacturing facilities (deadline was 31 March), overhaul the 2019 national policy around electronics global value chain integration, and extend the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to electronic components and to more labour-intensive sectors with linkages to MSMEs.

Infrastructure push

Nomura India believes that focus on public capex will remain a key tenet of the government’s economic strategy. Consequently, it expects the government to dial-up its total capex outlay to 3.5 per cent of GDP, from the 3.4 per cent of GDP presented in the interim Budget. Given states’ demands, the government could raise the unconditional amount transferred under the 50-year interest free loan for infrastructure spending.

Medium-term economic vision

Since this is the first budget after the elections, it will be an important platform for the government to establish its medium-term economic vision and the reform agenda. In particular, Nomura expects the government to present its vision for India to be a developed economy by 2047, and how that translates into specific goals over the next five years. Reports suggest the government could introduce reforms that do not require any legislative approval. Also, the government could provide more clarity on the medium-term fiscal glide path beyond the target of ‘lower than 4.5 per cent of GDP’ by FY26, Nomura India said.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/from-consumption-lift-to-infra-boost-budget-2024-likely-to-be-focused-on-these-5-themes-8966129.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024: Economists Expect Policy Continuity, Ease of Doing Business, and Fiscal Discipline","Even as the Indian economy remains the fastest-growing major economy in the world, economists said it will continue like this in future as well. In the Budget 2024, which Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present on July 23, the economists expect the government to ensure policy continuity, introduce reforms including ease of doing business, and demonstrate its commitment to fiscal consolidation and control on market borrowings.

Suman Chowdhury, chief economist & head of research at Acuite Ratings and Research, said, “While continuing its commitment to spending that will boost growth of the economy, the government is also expected to demonstrate its commitment to fiscal consolidation and control on market borrowings. In the current scenario, two important developments have taken place on the fiscal front: (i) higher-than-projected tax revenues in the first quarter of the year which may induce the government to increase its tax collection estimates (ii) substantially high dividend from the RBI of Rs 2.1 lakh crore.”

In the interim Budget 2024-25, the government had pegged the fiscal deficit of 5.1 per cent for the full fiscal. According to sources, the government might reduce it to 5 per cent in the full Budget 2024-25.

Additional capital inflows in the current year may support additional spending on welfare and also on capital expenditure, he added.

“At the same time, we expect the government to demonstrate its commitment to fiscal consolidation by not just sticking to the glidepath of a 4.5 per cent fiscal deficit by FY26 but also making an effort to improve on it. While the disinvestment programme of the government is uncertain at this point, we may see some measures to step up on asset monetisation,” Chowdhury said.

Sandeep Vempati, an economist with BJP, said the Union Budget 2024-25 must ensure policy continuity while introducing reforms including ease of doing business and climate change that would align with realizing the Vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047 as exhorted by Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“In the near term, the continued higher share of capital expenditure will complement the RBI’s monetary policy in aligning the inflation to 4 per cent which can induce RBI in reducing interest rates. Consequently, interest rate sensitive sectors like housing and automobiles will see increased economic activity,” he added.

The fiscal policy in the medium term must aim to reduce poverty, create income earning opportunities, induce shift from agriculture to manufacturing and services, raise the share of manufacturing GDP, ensure positive real income growth, promote savings and consolidate fiscally, Vempati said.

R P Gupta, an industrialist and author ‘Turn Around India: 2020’, said the government should review export duty on minerals and other customs duties to promote exports.

He also urged the government to push green energy production. “Incentives on gobar gas plant shall provide cheaper fuel in rural area and reduce methane emission, which is 21 times of CO2 emission per cubic meter.”

Gupta also expects to government to maintain fiscal discipline and cut fiscal deficit.

India’s Current Economic Situation

The Indian economy has registered a GDP growth of 8.2 per cent CAGR over the 3-year period ending 2023-24. The Indian economy has been the fastest-growing large economy. This is attributable to the structural reforms initiated in the last decade and also aided by the supply side reforms initiated during the Covid times. Various agencies express their optimism that this momentum will continue in FY25 too with forecasts ranging from 6.6 per cent to 8 per cent.

“Overall, the Indian economy is expected to be the fastest growing economy among the large economies until 2030. The Indian economy’s nominal GDP is expected to surpass $7 trillion by 2030 while becoming the world’s third largest economy surpassing the German and Japanese GDP,” economist Vempati said.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/budget-2024-economists-expect-policy-continuity-ease-of-doing-business-and-fiscal-descipline-8966431.html
news18.com,Budget 2024 Likely To Bring Tax Relief For Middle Class; Here's What Experts Say,"As India prepares for the first Union Budget of the government’s third term, there is heightened anticipation regarding potential reforms in personal taxation. This year, stakeholders are particularly focused on key areas that could impact individuals and senior citizens, as well as influence investment behaviour in capital markets and derivatives trading.

The current tax structure under the simplified tax regime features multiple brackets ranging from 5% to 30%, causing complexity and administrative burden. Authorities are expected to continue focusing on the new regime and may seek to simplify it by consolidating tax rates into broader categories.

The government is reportedly considering measures to potentially reduce personal income tax rates to bolster GDP growth by stimulating consumption, especially given the subdued spending levels among the middle class.

In the forthcoming budget, the government plans to raise the income threshold for tax liability from the current Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. This adjustment aims to increase disposable income, particularly among lower-income groups, and applies exclusively to taxpayers under the new regime.

Tax Relief for the Middle-Class

Amit Gupta, Partner at Saraf and Partners, and Rahul Charkha, Partner at Economic Laws Practice, highlighted that every year, taxpayers compile a wish list for the government, hoping for tax relief measures such as an increase in the tax exemption limit and higher deduction amounts to ease their tax burden.

Gupta said that the legislature’s mandate is to align the tax amendments to widen the tax base and provide the requisite stimulus to the areas of prime importance for the Nation at large.

“Considering the government would be aiming to induce higher consumption levels in the economy, tax reliefs resulting in the higher post-tax take-home income for the taxpayers may be expected,” Gupta said.

Charkha also felt that there is a strong possibility of tax relief for the middle class in the upcoming budget.

“The current tax slabs, set in 2013, are outdated. Inflation has eroded purchasing power, with April 2024’s retail inflation at 4.83% [Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation]. The basic exemption limit has remained at Rs 2.5 lakhs since 2015,” Charkha underlined.

These could be around further rationalisation to push the new-default tax regime to garner more adoption, more presumptive taxation regimes, hiking the allowable deduction of interest on housing, education, electric car loans, etc, Gupta added.

Simplification Of Tax Regimes

Budget 2024 Expectations Tax Slab

The Budget 2023 introduced the new tax regime, making it more attractive by changing the tax slabs, introducing standard deductions, increasing the limit of rebates, and extending the regime to the association of persons and bodies of individuals.

Gupta noted that the government has been carrying out various measures aiming to simplify the tax regime including compliance processes and the same has been an ongoing process. The same would ensure deepening the tax base and raking in more taxes for the exchequer.

The simplification of the taxation regime should also help mitigate the protracted litigation on tax matters. More rationalised presumptive/composition taxation schemes with a wider ambit/threshold would encourage more taxpayer onboarding and ease the administrative burden for tax collection, Gupta said.

“The need for simplifying the tax structure still exists. Proponents argue for a simpler system with fewer deductions, while others believe deductions are crucial for specific financial goals and social needs,” Charkha noted.

Enhancing the Scope of Deductions

Gupta noted that the legislators have gradually been phasing out exemptions and/or deductions enshrined in the income tax statute for simplification and parallelly introducing more deeming anti-abuse provisions into the tax statutes.

“The boost in investment may ideally be driven through more taxpayer-centric rationalisations in the direct and indirect taxes, especially taxes on gains resulting from investments.”

Middle-Class Awaits Relief

Charkha also joined the dots on how the global economic crisis and the Russia-Ukraine war have worsened inflation and disrupted businesses, prompting many countries to revise their tax policies.

However, Charkha added that middle-class Indians have not seen any major relief.

Rising healthcare and education costs further strain household budgets. High taxes reduce consumer spending, hindering economic growth. Inflation erodes the value of existing tax breaks and deductions over time.

“Budget 2024 might consider indexing tax slabs and deductions to inflation to maintain their effectiveness and provide the much-needed relief,” Charkha said.

“Given the rising cost of living, limited discretionary income, and ongoing legal cases, there is a strong argument for revising tax slabs and providing relief to middle-class taxpayers.”

“It may be noted that the Supreme Court’s Janhit Abhiyan case upheld the 103rd Constitutional Amendment, granting 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) with an annual family income below Rs 8 lakh. Despite this classification, those earning below Rs 8 lakh still pay income tax,” Charkha pointed out.

The Standard Deduction Debate

Charkha elaborated that a single, simplified system with fewer deductions would be easier for taxpayers to navigate.

However, some deductions are crucial for long-term financial planning and social needs, Charkha added.

“The middle class hopes for increased tax slabs, higher deduction limits, and lower surcharge rates. Salaried individuals wish for higher standard deductions and deductions for official expenses. Senior citizens desire increased deduction limits for health insurance and medical expenses. Working women would benefit from childcare cost deductions,” Charkha highlighted.

Tax Slabs: Way Forward

Charkha said that considering inflation’s impact on existing tax breaks, Budget 2024 might index tax slabs and deductions to inflation.

Potential reforms include revising tax slabs under both regimes, increasing the basic exemption and rebate limit, reducing the surcharge rate, and introducing a combined deduction for medical expenses, health insurance, and life insurance premiums.

Charkha also underlined that the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of health insurance leading to individuals spending more on health insurance.

“Raising the deduction limit under Section 80D, particularly for senior citizens (perhaps to Rs 75,000), would be a welcome change, promoting health security while offering tax benefits,” Charkha added.

Additionally, experts felt allowing home loan deductions under the new regime could incentivize more taxpayers to switch. By implementing these changes, the government can create a more streamlined and taxpayer-friendly tax system.

Boosting investment through tax incentives or enhancing the scope of deductions

Tax breaks play a crucial role in encouraging individuals to invest and save for the future.

Section 80C, the most commonly used deduction, allows taxpayers to invest in instruments like life insurance premiums, tuition fees, and home loan repayments.

The expenditure on life insurance premiums, tuition fees, and principal repayment of home loans has also substantially increased. With increased awareness, people are actively utilising these options, often reaching the current limit of Rs 1.5 lakh. The taxpayers have thus been eagerly waiting for an increase in this limit for several budgets, Charkha noted.

The cost of living, including inflation and rising expenses like education and housing, has significantly outpaced the increase in the Section 80C limit. To address this gap, many taxpayers are hoping for a substantial hike, ideally to Rs 3 lakh.

However, a more realistic expectation, considering past trends, might be an increase to Rs 2 lakh in the upcoming budget considering the consistency of the increase in the limit of Section 80C by Rs 50,000 after 9 years in 2014.

Beyond Section 80C, several other deductions and exemptions are available, such as those for health insurance (Section 80D), education loan interest (Section 80E), and housing loan interest (Section 80EE). Similarly, deductions exist for charitable donations (Section 80G), rent payments without HRA (Section 80GG), and savings bank interest (Sections 80TTA and 80TTB).

“Unfortunately, the limits for these haven’t been revised in recent years. The Government should take cognizance, not just of the inflation but also the Covid-19 pandemic, increase in interest rates, property rates, philanthropy and consider revising these limits,” Charkha added.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/tax/budget-2024-likely-to-bring-tax-relief-for-middle-class-heres-what-experts-say-8966787.html
news18.com,Union Budget 2024 Expectations LIVE: Will FM Sitharaman Announce Income Tax Relief?,"Budget 2024 Expectations on Manufacturing Samit Jain, managing director, PLUSS Advanced Technologies, said, “Great focus has been given by the ministry and government over the last years on expanding the adoption of clean technologies and also supporting the growth of startups as well as MSMEs. None of this will bear fruits, unless the government takes drastic steps to improve infrastructure and lower production costs for MSMEs. Power infrastructure has to be upgraded in all industrial areas. Further simplification of labour laws is necessary and reducing the compliance costs. Clearances for pollution control need to be streamlined and made simpler for organisations to adhere to.” To further R&D, direct funding or grants to industry is necessary, rather than through universities. Industry needs to be able to control and drive new investments in research. Energy circularity needs to be promoted by giving incentives to industry and commercial infrastructure that are able to significantly demonstrate reuse of energy. Just like being done for reuse of water. This will grow major segments like thermal energy storage, that is gaining prevalence in Europe but not yet in India, he added.

Budget 2024 Likely To Push Districts As Economic Hubs Budget 2024 Expectations LIVE: “The strategy for the upcoming Union Budget 2024-25 should be to extend focus Districts as Economic Hubs, Rural Development, MSMEs, Manufacturing, Exports, Housing, Infrastructure and Skill Development so that quality earning opportunities can be ensured and earnings can be improved leading to higher growth rate of consumption and consequent higher private investments,” said Sandeep Vempati, an economist with BJP.

Budget 2024 Expectations LIVE: Govt May Impose 20% TCS on Forex Spending Via Credit Cards Union Budget may impose a 20% tax collected at source (TCS) on overseas credit card spending above Rs 7 lakh to curb forex outflows.

Budget 2024 Expectations from Housing Finance industry Budget 2024 Expectations LIVE: “Affordable housing should be one of the most important long-term agendas for the country. Significant changes in socio-economic and urbanisation indicators necessitate a re-alignment of affordable housing definition in many of the cities and towns. There is also a need to appropriately incentivise developers to increase the supply of affordable green housing. Given the success of earlier PMAY scheme, we eagerly await the revised contours of the PMAY-U 2.0 scheme which promises to focus on improved targeting of beneficiaries and provide timely disbursement to completed homes. We hope that the Union Budget for 2024-25 would provide directions to consolidate efforts towards ‘Housing for All’ initiative across all strata,” said Deepak Patkar, MD & CEO, SMFG Grihashakti.

Budget 2024 Live Updates: Taxation of market-linked debentures Jayesh H, Co-founder, Juris Corp Advocates and Solicitors, said, “Hoping that the taxation of market-linked debentures is rethought. They have killed a good product (which was helping in the growth of bond markets) in their wanting to plug tax loopholes.” Jayesh added that it would help if there is a comprehensive redesign of capital gains across various classes of financial assets including when held directly and when held through MFs and when held through other collective schemes. And a relook at the definition of Virtual Digital Asset is a must. In their zeal to dissuade investments in cryptocurrencies and NFTs, they are killing the usage of blockchain technology in the mainstream financial markets, Jayesh urged.

Budget 2024 Expectations on HRA, Income Tax, Tax Slabs and ITR Budget 2024 Expectations LIVE: “The salaried class has always kept high expectations from the budget, but the last few budgets have been quite disappointing in terms of opportunities to optimize tax and potential for long term savings with higher returns. Few asks could include raising the basic exemption slab to at least 5 lacs and simplifying the tax rates to 10%, 20% and maximum 30% along with eliminating the surcharge and cess. Sec. 80C limits could be enhanced to at least 3 lacs from the current 1.5 lacs. Interest limits on housing loans and principal repayments could be enhanced further. Income Tax Returns could be simplified for Employees who have no other source of income other than salary, the submission by Employer along with TDS as applicable must be considered as auto filing of returns,” said Mahesh Krishnamoorthy, Managing Director, Core Integra.

Budget 2024 Expectations from Consumer Pharma, Health Sectors Budget 2024 Expectations LIVE: “The pharmaceutical industry needs more investment, and the government must incentivize and fund cutting-edge drug research and development. Streamlining regulations to speed up approvals for new treatments and investing in educating a workforce skilled in pharmaceutical innovation are crucial. Simultaneously, authorities need to weed out players that don’t conform to high-quality drug standards accepted globally, to become more credible and contribute to export earnings. These efforts will usher in a new era of Indian pharmaceutical leadership, characterized by path-breaking outcomes. The industry can then be part of India’s ambitious Viksit Bharat journey,” said Krishna Prasad Chigurupati, Chairman and Managing Director, Granules India. He added that as an industry leader, Granules India exhorts the Union Government to aggressively pursue its ambitious renewable energy and green hydrogen projects. This will demonstrate the country’s commitment to sustainable development, economic growth, energy independence, and global leadership in reducing carbon emissions. Apurve Mehra, CEO of Biogetica, said: “We commend the government’s commitment to advancing quality healthcare in India and are confident that the continued reforms and policies will bolster innovation and enhance regulatory efficiency. The government should focus on expanding the Ayush-based healthcare and wellness sector, which is projected to reach $70 billion by next year. As we stand at a critical juncture, the right support and guidance from the government are essential to leading a transformative impact on holistic health practices in India. We urge the Government and Finance Minister to introduce a special package to bolster the Ayush sector in the upcoming budget. This will significantly improve Ayush infrastructure, research, and accessibility. Additionally, we hope Ayush products will receive subsidies and that incentives will be provided to support Ayush companies & startups.”

Budget 2024 Expectations from Consumer Electronics Sector Budget 2023 Expectations Updates LIVE: “For the Union Budget 2024-25, there is a strong sense of optimism within the electronics industry. The Government’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes have already demonstrated their potential, driving remarkable growth, attracting investments, and enhancing our manufacturing capabilities. We anticipate continued support in the upcoming budget. To elevate our industry to global standards, it is imperative to enhance support for exporting ‘Made in India’ products. As the budget approaches, we look forward to policies that reinforce domestic manufacturing, foster innovation, and enhance our global competitiveness. Sustained backing for the ‘Make in India’ initiative remains crucial to our trajectory,” said Ashok Rajpal -Managing Director – Ambrane India. He added that critical investments in infrastructure and technology will be pivotal for the growth of the electronics manufacturing sector.

The government could also consider an increase in tax exemption limits under Section 80C and Section 80D,” he added. To promote savings towards retirement, the government should provide additional tax deductions for investment in retirement benefit schemes like NPS (National Pension Scheme). “We also expect to see initiatives for financial inclusion specifically for women. Special tax saving schemes for women and incentivising women to invest would be measures that could contribute to a more inclusive and diverse investment landscape,” Bhatnagar highlighted.

Budget 2024 Live Updates: R&D Fund For Research In Drone Segment Rama Krishna, Co-founder & CEO, EndureAir, said, “As market demand accelerate, the industry is expecting the government to establish a separate R&D fund for research apart from the PLI Scheme in the Drone segment to keep industry players future-ready.” “The allocation of funds towards research and development would be a significant step forward, as major orders come from the government and IA. We are optimistic that this budget will facilitate growth and position India as a global leader in UAV solutions.”

Budget 2024 Live Updates: MSME Demands Major Benefits Tarun Singh, MD, Highbrow Securities, said, “I am optimistic about transformative reforms that will uplift the MSME sector, a cornerstone of our economy. I foresee significant initiatives aimed at investment in human capital, improved credit access, streamlined listing processes, extended moratoriums, lower interest rates, and interest subvention schemes.” Singh added incentivizing MSMEs with tax benefits, subsidies, and support for technological upgrades will promote a focused approach on value creation.

Budget 2024 Live Updates: Boost PPP Model in Healthcare Abhishek Aggarwal, Chief Business Officer, Birla Fertility & IVF, said, “Government initiatives like Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) and the National Health Mission have helped connect millions of people to essential health services and insurance. However, given the size of our country, this requires more impetus, particularly through increased public-private partnerships.” “In the infertility space, we hope to see a greater focus from the government. While India has the world’s largest population, falling fertility rates will have an impact in the next 25-30 years. Research Report published by The Lancet suggests that India’s total fertility rate (TFR) is irreversibly plunging to 1.29, and by 2050, one in five Indians will be a senior citizen.” “The predictive scenario is alarming. We must not overlook the data and repeat the same oversights made by developed countries. Including fertility and IVF treatment under insurance coverage can make affordable healthcare a reality for all, bringing joy to many couples longing for parenthood. It will help build healthy families and secure the future of the nation.”

Budget 2024 Live Updates: 'Real Estate Sector Should Be Granted Industry Status' Hitesh Avhad, Managing Director, Avhad Group, said, “There is an urgent need for the sector to be granted industry status, which would facilitate access to lower-cost financing and tax benefits. High taxes on essential materials such as cement and steel, particularly the 28% GST on cement, are inflating project costs and must be addressed to sustain growth.” Implementing a single-window clearance system would significantly streamline approval processes, accelerating project timelines and reducing costs. Additionally, enhancing tax benefits for homebuyers by raising the deduction limit for home loan interest payments and providing income tax relief on second homes would spur demand and make homeownership more attainable. “The sector’s growth is vital not just for economic metrics but for improving the livelihoods of millions, particularly casual laborers. By addressing these pressing issues in the upcoming budget, the government can ensure sustained growth in the real estate sector, drive job creation and stimulate broader economic development.”",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/budget-2024-live-updates-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-income-tax-liveblog-8965639.html
news18.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: Tax Practitioners Urge Govt To Rationalise Personal Income Tax,"Budget 2024: A direct tax practitioners’ body has urged the union government to reduce the personal income tax burden on citizens in the upcoming budget later this month.

Budget 2024 Expectations Income Tax

All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (AIFTP) president Narayan Jain stated that the exemption limit should be increased to Rs 5 lakh.



He emphasized the need for simplifying the tax structure to ease compliance.

“Income between Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh be taxed at 10 per cent, between Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh at 20 per cent, and income above Rs 20 lakh at 25 per cent,” Jain said in his memorandum to the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Jain suggested eliminating the surcharge and cess, arguing that their continuation is no longer justified.

He said that the government does not adequately explain how the education cess is utilised, emphasizing that providing education and medical facilities is a fundamental duty of the government.

The memorandum also addresses the tax rate under section 115BBE on unexplained cash credits, loans, investments, and expenditures, which was increased to 75 per cent plus cess during the demonetization period.

Jain advocates for reverting this rate to the original 30 per cent.

Budget 2024 Standard Deduction

The finance ministry is reportedly considering raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new tax regime while leaving the tax exemption-heavy old regime unchanged.

The finance minister may consider increasing the standard deduction to up to Rs 1 lakh per annum in the upcoming budget.

news18.com,Union Budget 2024 Expectations LIVE: Will FM Nirmala Sitharaman Increase Section 80C Deduction Limit?,"Budget 2024 Expectations from Education Sector Union Budget 2024 Latest Updates: In the new globalised world, education has become the passport to progress and students across India are looking for opportunities. Some specific areas of favourable allocation in the budget should include: Expansion of infrastructure for education, investment in skill development programmes (particularly in areas that align with emerging industries), expansion of scholarships and other financial aid programs for students from economically weaker sections of society, implementation of new pedagogical methods that focus on learning for a lifetime, strengthening of vocational training programs to equip students with industry-relevant skills and increased investment in research and innovation in the field of education. There is also a need to upscale the education system to attract more foreign students to the country to promote India as a global study destination, said Shweta Sastri, managing director of Canadian International School, Bangalore. Addressing issues like gender disparity, access to quality education in rural areas, and the need for increased investment in education are crucial in achieving equitable and inclusive education for all.

Budget 2024 Wishlist from Healthcare Sector Union Budget 2024 Latest Updates: Healthcare is a rapidly growing sector in the country but needs attention from the government to ensure access to all sections of society. From the upcoming Union Budget, the industry urges the government to focus on the professional development and growth of healthcare personnel in India as this would have a widespread positive impact on the healthcare sector. “We expect a generous financial allocation and investment in bridging gaps that exist in the education, career growth, and upskilling of healthcare professionals. The budget could also propose investment in the establishment of a ‘Clinical Governance System’ that assists in the development of clinical protocols, monitoring of their implementation and outcome and the standardization of care delivery that helps in cost control. Policies that empower the diverse community of the healthtech sector — from students to seasoned practitioners—to enhance their professional prospects and growth through technology-enabled, personalized support in healthcare and its related sectors would be welcome,” Chandrika Kambam, founder and managing director of healthtech platform Anastomos, said. She added that there is also an urgent need for a supportive regulatory framework for healthcare startups that encourages innovation while ensuring compliance. Tax incentives, grants, and dedicated incubation centers to foster growth within the healthtech ecosystem would enhance its growth in the larger healthcare sector. Additionally, the upcoming union budget presents a significant opportunity for the government to support the growth of startups driven by women entrepreneurs, especially in the healthtech sector. They can be empowered through targeted financial assistance, mentorship programs, and subsidy initiatives. Lastly, robust investments in cybersecurity infrastructure and regulations are essential to protect sensitive health data. Integrating healthtech solutions with government schemes like Ayushman Bharat would also enhance efficiency and expand access to quality healthcare across India.”

Budget 2024 Wishlist from FMCG Sector Akash Agrawal, co-founder of Zoff Foods, said, “We urge the government to address the current inverted tax structure within the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework. This structure impacts food manufacturers, hindering their ability to claim the full Input Tax Credit (ITC) due to higher tax rate paid for services and other items as compared to lower tax rate of raw materials. The tax rate on basic raw material procurement and final product is 5%, which makes a significant ITC blockage for manufacturers, leading to an average cash flow deficit of 10-15%. For instance, the tax rate on services is 18% whereas the tax of other raw materials range between 12%-18%. This ultimately translates to reduced investments in production capacity, innovation, and job creation.” The government should consider revising the tax structure or implementing policy amendments to ensure a smoother flow of ITC for food manufacturers. This will not only improve the financial health of the industry but also contribute to the government’s objective of a robust and competitive food processing industry, he added.

Budget 2024 Expectations from Pharmaceuticals Industry Deepak Pahwa, director of Delair, said, “The pharmaceutical industry is optimistic about the upcoming budget, especially following the government’s implementation of enhanced quality control measures like Good Manufacturing Practices and revised Schedule M. With the Indian pharma sector making significant strides globally, increased budget allocation can bolster our international standing. We anticipate initiatives incentivising R&D to support the local manufacturing of high-quality pharma products. Additionally, PLI schemes could greatly assist in establishing advanced manufacturing facilities and integrating cutting-edge technologies and machinery. These steps are vital for promoting innovation and sustainable growth within the industry.”

Budget 2024 Wishlist from Co-Working Players Manas Mehrotra, founder of coworking firm 315Work Avenue, said, “Taking into consideration the popularity of hybrid working, we have a few expectations around GST and taxation from the upcoming Union Budget that can further accelerate growth of this sector.” The salary upper limit of 25k could be enhanced to 40k and timeline from 3 yrs to 5 yrs to enable start-ups/coworking entities to enjoy the benefit of sec 80JJAA as these industries are generating a greater volume of employment. Input tax credit under GST is an important issue that concerns coworking sector. We expect the budget would enable coworking firms to claim input credit on work contract and construction services supplied so that it is passed on to companies who lease out space for coworking and thereby reduce their overall costs, Manas said. “There are few other aspects that needs attention. Typically stamp and registration duties are high and since both the landlord as well as client agreements are subject to these charges, hence, either concession in such stamp duty rates or allowing twice the duty paid as expenditure under income tax will encourage even the small agreements to get registered. An important requirement for the coworking industry has been Lower/Concessional rate of TDS which will improve the working capital. Another measure that could be announced to intensify growth of the coworking sector is a further and continued extension of tax holiday for start-ups as they would be motivated to scale up their business and enhance investment,” he added.

Budget 2024 Wishlist from Healthcare Sector Vineet Narang, founder & managing director of HearClear India, said, “The elder Care Segment in India needs government focus. Our elderly population is growing and will reach a staggering 34.7 Crore by 2050. The Indian Healthcare ecosystem will need to gear up to manage this growing old population. We are fully aligned with the Government Proposal of health benefits to all individuals over 60 years of age, with contributory scheme coverage of Rs 5 Lakh annually. This is a much needed step and should be implemented at the earliest.” Further we really request the Government to implement their proposal of expansion of Ayushman Bharat PM Jan Arogya Yojana to cover all Senior Citizens. This should also cover in-home care needs of elderly patients. Today in-home care is the need of the hour and specifically with increasing age, healthcare at home will bring huge relief to our ageing elders, he said. Indian Diagnostic Infrastructure needs a significant boost. ‘Proximity to Patient’ is a critical step towards ‘Healthcare for All’. Patient should either get diagnostics done at home or if specific tests cannot be done at home, one should be able to find a High Quality Diagnostic Center within a 5 km radius. We urge the government to provide financial assistance, and special reliefs for new start-ups to enter the diagnostics space and create private infrastructure to feed the growing demand, he added.

Budget 2024 Expectations: Fintech Industry's Wishlist For Bank Mitras Seema Prem, co-founder & CEO of FIA Global, shares some measures that should be announced in the Budget to support Bank Mitras/Business Correspondents, who serve as essential frontline workers in delivering financial services, on enhancing their infrastructure and financial sustainability: 1. Infrastructure Grant Fund: Establishment of an infrastructure grant fund tailored for Bank Mitras. Given the perpetual necessity to upgrade hardware, such a fund would ensure access to the latest equipment. Bank Mitras would then be able to operate more effectively. 2. India Business Correspondent Equity Fund: Like the India Microfinance Equity Fund, IBCEF may be created as a partnership between the Central Government and the Development Finance Institutions. A dedicated fund providing equity to Bank Mitras will help them achieve scale and efficiency in operations. These investments will empower Bank Mitras to make enduring contributions to their communities, and will also allow them to thrive economically.

Budget 2024 Expectations: What Does Equities Market Expect? The Indian economy is moving on a strong growth trajectory. This makes the government finances comfortable on the revenue side. The budget is expected to maintain the fiscal deficit and borrowing targets same as the February interim budget. “There could be some positive announcements on allocations towards rural economy. Also, there is a possibility of tax benefits for the lower income brackets. Focus on capital expenditure is also expected to continue with increasing central expenditure, persuading state level capex and also incentivising private capex. Overall, we are likely to see policy continuity,” said Nimesh Chandan, CIO of Bajaj Finserv Asset Management.

Budget 2024 Expectations: Railways, Shipping Shares On Upward Move Railways’ shares like RVNL, Titagarh Rail, etc and the shipping sector stocks like Shipping Corporation of India and Mazagaon Dockyard, among others, have been on the up move in the stock market for the past few days amid reports that the government is likely to announce measures for these sectors.

Budget 2024: Will Government Increase Section 80C Tax Deduction Limit? As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her 7th Budget, there are various expectations. One of the major expectations is an increase in Section 80C tax deductions. These deductions are available for old tax regime and offer exclusion on income up to Rs 1.5 lakh from the calculation of tax liability in a year.

Budget Expectations from Wealth Management Sector “As we approach the 2024 India Budget, we are cautiously optimistic about the potential measures that will be announced. We believe this budget presents a pivotal opportunity to bolster economic growth and investor confidence. We anticipate the government’s focus on stimulating key sectors such as infrastructure, healthcare, and technology, which are critical for long-term sustainable development. An important announcement that we expect is on ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans). These are employee incentives that companies use to attract, reward, and retain talent. ESOPs also enable employees to become shareholders and benefit from the company’s growth. Most of the new generation companies give part of company stake as ESOPs to senior employees, who work as well as promoters, but end up losing 40% value vis-a-vis promoters who can enjoy long-term capital gains (LTCG) advantage on equity. This situation needs to be rectified to enable them to earn higher margins,” Swati Saxena, founder and CEO, 4Thoughts Finance, a wealth management firm. Additionally, the re-investment from sale of startups is exempted from tax only for Rs 10 cr investment in real estate. However, there is a need to encourage startup investments and make the sector more appealing. One way could be to enable re-investment in startups to get a boost through a tax exemption. We also see the automotive industry looking forward to some key measures in the upcoming budget, especially with the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicle (FAME). Increased support in R&D of the EV sector can also help boost India as a global leader in EV Technology. The budget can also ensure greater sync between Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT), which is very high, and Long-Term Capital gains on equity which is very low. All these measures would prove beneficial to the liquidity availability in the economy and ensure its healthy growth, she added.

Budget 2024 Date: Budget Session of Parliament To Be Held Between July 22 and August 12 Parliament’s Budget Session will be held between July 22 and August 12, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2023-25 on July 23. It will be her 7th annual financial statement in a row. The government will likely present the Economic Survey on July 22. This will be the first full budget of the Modi Govt 3.0. An interim budget was presented on February 1, 2024, due to the Lok Sabha polls, which were held in April-June. Nirmala Sitharaman on June 12 took office for her second consecutive term as the minister of finance and corporate affairs. After taking charge as the finance minister in the Modi 3.0 government, Sitharaman highlighted the objectives and outlined how the 2024 full budget will include various aspects of the Indian economy.

Budget Expectations from Healthcare Sector “The healthcare sector in India is on the brink of excellence. There is an increased focus on treating unique patient cases, robotic surgeries, and increasing prominence of AI for accurate diagnosis. To reach the next phase, emphasis must be laid on innovation, research & development, and infrastructure development. These are the foundations for India’s health sector to achieve an international standard of treatment for all. Strengthening infrastructure will create a robust healthcare network in rural India, benefiting the entire population. However, affordability remains a challenge in accessing healthcare services and treatments. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) can effectively address these challenges by combining the resources of both public and private entities to deliver comprehensive healthcare nationwide. Additionally, the healthcare sector needs programs to provide training at various levels to address the talent shortage. We positively look forward to the Union Budget 2024-25 with the hope that it will address the existing challenges in the healthcare sector,” said Joseph Pasangha, Group COO, SPARSH Hospital, Bengaluru.

Budget Expectations from Real Estate Sector The real estate sector expects a range of measures from the government in the Union Budget 2024-25, including industry status to the sector and tax reliefs. Mohit Goel, managing director of Omaxe, said, “We urge the government to consider increasing the deduction limit for interest on home loans from the current Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh annually, which could dramatically boost housing demand. Additionally, reducing the GST on under-construction properties and adjusting the pricing of raw materials would further stimulate the market. These changes are essential not just for energizing the sector but also for driving demand in approximately 250 related industries.” Aditya Kushwaha, CEO and director of Axis Ecorp, said, “The real estate sector has flourished in recent years despite challenges such as rising property prices and the highest interest rates in six years. Demand for luxury real estate and second home categories has remained robust. We anticipate that the 2024 Budget will favour homebuyers, supporting the sector’s ongoing growth. The recent focus on affordable housing is expected to continue, especially with FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s interim budget announcement of adding 2 crore more houses to the PMAY-U scheme. A similar emphasis on affordable housing in the upcoming budget would be beneficial.” Nayan Raheja from Raheja Developers said, “The real estate sector expects the government to ensure by taking certain initiatives at the policy level in its forthcoming budget. Industry status and single-window clearance are long pending demands, and we hope for affirmative action on these. Raising the deduction limit under section 80C for principal repayment of housing loans from the present 150,000 is among other initiatives the sector is hoping for. We are hopeful that the budgetary announcements will further boost the sector’s potential and enhance its share in the country’s economy.” Ashwinder R Singh, co-chair of CII’s NR Committee on Real Estate, CEO Residential at Bhartiya Urban, and Author, said, “The real estate sector has certain expectations for the 2024-2025 Union Budget. These include increasing the home loan interest rebate to Rs 5 lakh, reducing GST on construction, redefining affordable housing limits, granting industry status, incentivizing sustainable practices, and implementing a single-window clearance system.” Ankush Kaul, chief business officer of Ambience Group, said, “The Indian real estate sector contributes roughly 8% to GDP and is the second-highest employment generator in the country. Ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25, one of the sector’s primary expectations is granting industry status along with the single-window clearance system. Considering these long-pending demands would give a new push to the sector.”

Budget 2024 Expectations on SEZ Law Gunjan Prabhakaran, partner & leader (indirect tax) at BDO India, said the market expects the Union Budget 2024-25 to provide clarity on the future of SEZ law (e.g. continuation of present SEZ Act or introduction of proposed DESH bill) especially in the context of the first 100 days plan of MOC with respect to changes in SEZ law (NFE, payment of input taxes rather than Customs duty on DTA supplies by SEZ, etc.) and the steps to generate economies of scale.

Union Budget 2024 Latest Updates: Govt May Relax 45-day Payment Rule for MSMEs in Budget The government may relax the requirement of making payments to MSMEs within 45 days of buying goods and services to check large corporate from looking at other sourcing avenues, sources said. The announcement to this effect could be made in the Budget likely to be presented on July 23. The government is considering suggestions regarding changes to Section 43B(h) of the Income Tax Act made by MSMEs during pre-Budget consultations, sources said. The government in last year’s Budget added a new clause under Section 43B of the Income Tax Act to address the challenge of delayed payments faced by MSMEs in the country. According to Section 43B(h) of the Income Tax Act, introduced through the Finance Act 2023, if a larger company does not pay an MSME on time — within 45 days in case of written agreements — it cannot deduct that expense from its taxable income, leading to potentially higher taxes.

Union Budget 2024 Latest Updates: Govt May Introduce Amendments to Laws to Push Banking Sector Reforms The government is likely to introduce amendments to Banking Regulation Act 1949 and other laws to push banking sector reforms during the upcoming Budget session. Apart from this, amendments in the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970, and the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1980 are needed for privatisation of public sector banks, sources told PTI. These Acts led to the nationalisation of banks in two phases and provisions of these laws have to be changed for the privatisation of banks, they said. Amendments, if approved by Parliament, would help bring down government holding in state-owned banks below 51 per cent, improve bank governance and enhance investors’ protection, sources said.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/budget-2024-news-live-updates-date-expectations-income-tax-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-liveblog-8964128.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations LIVE: FM Sitharaman To Push Manufacturing, Job Creation","EV Industry's Expectations from Budget 2024 Devndra Chawla, MD and CEO of GreenCell Mobility, said, “In anticipation for Budget 2024, we have focused on essential imperatives that are critical to the long-term development of India’s dynamic electric vehicle (EV) market. One significant recommendation is to secure permanent viability gap funding for financially pressured State Transport Units (STUs) and to develop payment security mechanism to reduce lending risks and improve credit offtake.” We emphasise the importance of an infrastructure sector tag for financing to electric mobility projects and propose a capital expenditure subsidy for private bus operators that deploy e-buses on intercity routes. Categorising electric mobility loans as Priority Sector Lending and introducing incentives for battery recycling are critical steps towards lowering interest rates and promoting sustainability, he added. “Standardising Green energy open access rules, toll exemptions for electric buses, optimising charging costs through regulatory measures and opening government electric bus depots to private players are important to creating a suitable ecosystem. Initiatives such as wayside charging infrastructure on national highways, specialised facilities at transport hubs and strategic highway adoption plans for pure electric bus operations will also help sustainable mobility,” Chawla said.

Budget Expectations from FinTech Sector Rohit Arora, co-founder & CEO of Biz2Credit and Biz2X, said, “We anticipate a budget that prioritises enhancing digital lending frameworks and creating a stable policy environment, fostering a conducive environment for the growth of the fintech sector. Measures such as simplified regulatory procedures and reduced compliance burdens can empower startups and MSMEs, promoting a more agile and competitive landscape.” Furthermore, targeted efforts to create jobs in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities will address employment gaps and stimulate economic development across the country. Additionally, promoting Global Capability Centers (GCCs) with incentives for high-end job creation and upskilling will position India as a global leader in technology and innovation, he added.

Union Budget 2023 Expectation: Prioritize Growth Initiatives in the Services Sector This year’s budget has the power to impact the services sector significantly, and we expect it will prioritize growth initiatives in the sector. The sector needs streamlining of regulations and reduction of compliance burden. The GST tribunals need immediate operationalization. They are crucial to efficient resolution of backlog of GST-related disputes. There is clarity required on tax exemptions for services provided to government entities, particularly in healthcare sector. At a practical level, the point of taxation for manpower and security services needs to be changed from a billing system to a receipt-based system. This would significantly enhance cash flow management for services companies and align their taxation with actual revenue received. While the GST Council typically takes decisions on such matters, we hope the central government will consider these concerns in the upcoming Union Budget. – Sanjay Dighe, CEO & Director of Krystal Integrated Service Ltd

Budget Expectations From EdTech Sector Monica Malhotra Kandhari, managing director of Aasoka, and Amit Kapoor, co-founder of Eupheus Learning, shared their pre-budget 2024-25 expectations: Kandhari: “We hope that the forthcoming Union Budget under the Modi 3.0 government will provide increased funding and support innovative educational solutions. By investing in technology-driven and blended learning models, we can transform the education landscape across India. The National Education Policy 2020 emphasizes making learning interactive, engaging, and meaningful, and additional budget allocations can help bring this vision statement to life.” In a country with over 1.5 million schools and more than 250 million students, it is crucial to provide robust academic support and necessary resources. Enhanced funding can facilitate the integration of digital tools in classrooms, assist teachers in creating comprehensive lesson plans, and ensure that students from all backgrounds have access to quality education. We believe that with the right support, we can empower the next generation of students to excel in an ever-evolving world, she added. Kapoor: “As the Modi 3.0 government prepares the new union budget, we at Eupheus Learning expect to see greater support for digital infrastructure in schools and more funding for innovative educational technologies. Additionally, GST should be applicable on both print and digital solutions so as to create efficiencies in the ecosystem. These are important for making education accessible, affordable and effective for millions of students. We believe new policies in the education system should bridge the gap between in-class and at-home learning, providing every child with quality resources.” Using tools like STEM/STEAM kits and reading programs will enhance learning. Promoting activities like storytelling, Olympiads, and coding competitions will encourage creativity and critical thinking, empowering generations to be future ready, he added.

Union Budget 2024 Expectations: Economic vision of new govt, political theme key aspects to watch, says Nomura The upcoming Union budget for 2024 is anticipated to reflect the economic vision and political strategies of the new government, according to insights shared by Japanese brokerage Nomura on Thursday. Key aspects highlighted include the management of fiscal policies and expectations of subdued equity returns in the latter half of the year. Nomura has reaffirmed its year-end target of 24,860 points for the Nifty, indicating a modest 3% increase from current levels. The brokerage foresees muted returns in the equity market during the second half of the year. Looking beyond fiscal year 2026, the focus will be on the government’s commitment to reducing the fiscal deficit to 4.6%. Nomura’s India Economist Aurodeep Nandi emphasized this fiscal glide path as a crucial element to monitor. Nandi pointed out that the budget’s “political theme” will heavily depend on coalition partners, particularly from Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. The expectations revolve around how the government will address the demands of allies like Janata Dal and TDP, who hail from these states.

Budget 2024-25: Indian Steel Association Calls on FM Nirmala Sitharaman A delegation from the Indian Steel Association, led by industrialist and MP Naveen Jindal, calls on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday, ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25. Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23.

Budget Expectations from Travel and Tourism Sector Amit Jain, founder of Magicfares, shares his Budget 2024-25 expectations: “The Indian travel and tourism sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience recently. Increasing demand for hospitality services, bustling airports, and renowned travel destinations underscores that tourism is not merely a recreational activity but a crucial driver of global economic expansion. As per recent reports, the industry is expected to contribute significantly to the global GDP and employment creation by 2030, affirming its robust trajectory. With ancillary sectors also poised for significant growth, career opportunities are set to expand manifold in the travel and tourism industry. We need a cohesive approach that would encompass the public and private sector on one hand, and the government (state and central governments, and local authorities) on the other hand, in order to continue developing world class tourism infrastructure. Recognising tourism as a sustainable engine for economic growth and development, it is imperative to accord industry status to the travel and tourism sector, which will help in the regularization of policies and processes and better access to finance. We envision a strategic redistribution of tourism across diverse geographies, fostering inclusivity and exploration beyond traditional hotspots. The government’s continued efforts to enhance infrastructure, including new airports and expanded transportation networks, alongside developing religious circuits and lesser-known attractions, are pivotal for national growth and future-proofing the tourism sector. Improved accessibility can significantly boost tourism, benefiting local economies. We also believe that the standardisation of tax collected at source (TCS) at five per cent on foreign travel packages should be considered, against the current five per cent and 20 per cent slabs. This is hampering our business as customers prefer to use alternate channels that are outside the domestic tax net. The government should bring in changes such as reduction in income tax and related exemptions which could also benefit the sector to a great extent by creating a favorable environment for people to spend their disposable income on travel. We also expect rationalisation of GST rates to make hotel stays more affordable for tourists. The budget should modify the Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) rules to include the amount spent on hotel stays to be considered as LTA expense. Further, corporates should be offered with incentives for organizing meetings and conferences in India through partial or full tax exemptions on the expenses incurred, thereby boosting domestic travel and tourism. Incentives for hotels, resorts, and travel agencies are also needed to promote local destinations. We are also hoping for budgetary allocations for global marketing campaigns to promote tourism in the country. Overall, the industry looks forward to ease of doing business to ensure that the travel and tourism sector continues to be the one of the foremost employers in the country. As the sector contributes significantly to the influx of the forex, we expect the government to implement strategic initiatives that will position India as a global travel hub.”

Budget Expectations from Education, Skilling Sector Rohin Kapoor, partner of education and skilling- management consulting at BDO India, shares his pre-budget expectations from Budget 2024-25: Education Sector: -Expenditure on the education sector could be increased to at least 5% of India’s GDP. -Rolling out a fair & transparent central government driven regulatory framework for attracting foreign investment in K12 sector, similar to efforts in higher education. -Reforming & reorganising NTA in the best interests of the students & to avoid future controversies. -Announcement of investment in digital infrastructure to curb malpractices in competitive examinations. -Reintroduction of Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill to form one single regulator for higher education in the country. -Increased investment & intent in transforming teaching as a career of choice for the next generation. -Higher allocation to ‘train the teachers’ initiatives. Vocational Education & Skill Development Sector: -Higher budgetary allocation for building greenfield training facilities to meet future skilling requirements and further improvement of existing facilities. -Announcement for conducting skilling census to identify level of skills possessed & mapping it with the current/future demands of the industry. This will help us in identifying areas for future investments by government/corporates. -Job guaranteed linked skilling programmes are more likely to deliver better results. – Steps to increase participation of industry in the sector to increase employability.

Budget 2024 Expectations from Healthcare Sector Azad Moopen, founder and chairman of Aster DM Healthcare, said, “India has been progressing steadily in increasing investment in public health infrastructure, and we hope to see a significant increase in the healthcare sector’s budget allocation to at least 5 per cent of the GDP. This is crucial to address the existing gaps and enhance the overall quality of healthcare delivery in India.” While the last budget announced the establishment of nursing colleges alongside medical colleges, there is an urgent need for comprehensive reform of medical education to ensure that the medical professionals of tomorrow are aligned with contemporary healthcare needs. This necessitates the development of medical colleges, nursing colleges, and paramedical colleges in all 500 district hospitals across the country, he added. “However, we urge continued support in fostering a robust ecosystem for private sector participation in healthcare, which plays a pivotal role in supplementing the Government’s efforts. Additionally, initiatives aimed at enhancing medical education and skill development are essential to empower healthcare professionals and improve service delivery,” Moopen said. The pandemic has accelerated the rapid growth of the healthcare sector, creating a need for extensive learning and development for future specialists. Significant financial investments are necessary to incorporate advanced technology, implement realistic strategies, and foster methodologies driven by research and innovation. Additionally, skilled personnel will be essential for developing the brightest minds in the field. An excellent starting point would be a substantial budget to establish Central Medical Research and Innovation Institutes in every state. This initiative would address issues such as accessibility, equity, and healthcare costs. The creation of a Central Digital Health and AI University would further aid in utilizing technological innovation in healthcare. Moreover, a dedicated university for NRI students should also be established, he said. We were also hoping for concessions for NRIs residing abroad like reduction on TDS for those who have a source of income in India and are required to pay taxes in the country they reside in, he said. “Overall, the Budget 2024 sets a positive trajectory for the healthcare sector, and we look forward to collaborating with the Government in realising our shared vision of a healthier and more resilient India,” Moopen said.

Union Budget 2024-25: Expectations from Insurance Industry Rakesh Goyal, managing director of Probusinsurance.com, said, “The Union Finance Budget is around the corner, and like every time, the insurance industry has certain expectations from the government and the finance minister. These are not new topics or new prospects, but the ones that are in long-standing demand from the industry.” The first and foremost is the reduction in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on insurance premiums. Currently, GST on insurance premiums is 18 percent, which is considered high and a deterrent for potential policy buyers. If there is a reduction in GST, it will help the industry in a big way. Secondly, the policyholders should receive higher tax benefits for their medical insurance. We should raise the limit to Rs 50,000 for self, spouse, and children, and Rs 1 lakh for senior citizens. Finally, increase the limits for the Income Tax Act 80C. Right now, Indians get a tax exemption of Rs 1.5 lakh every year, but it’s crowded with various financial products. We would expect the limit to increase or to establish a separate exemption limit specifically for life insurance premiums. This move would help increase countrywide insurance penetration, he added.

Budget 2024 Likely To Push Manufacturing, Automobile The government is likely to push manufacturing and automobile in the Budget 2024-25, apart from job creation. In PM Modi’s meeting with eminent economists on Thursday, the global value chain (GVC) was also discussed, and talks took place to boost manufacturing in India.

Union Budget 2024 Live Updates: Schemes for Affordable Housing The real estate sector seeks affordable schemes and a better incentive for affordable housing. “Affordable housing today begins at Rs. 45 Lakhs for 60-90 sq. mt. carpet area for LIG. The government should increase the range with better brackets in metro cities like Delhi and Mumbai. Moreover, the Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) fund with Rs. 50,000 corpus should be included in the upcoming budget for rental housing schemes. The government should think about offering exemptions from property taxes for five years. This would make it easier for developers of build-to-lease and rent-to-own residential developments to raise money by creating a special fund”, Ar. Jaideep Thareja, Founder and Principal Architect at Jaideep Thareja Architects.

Union Budget 2024 Live Updates: A new step for the retail sector The retail sector can come up with a better solution for progressive momentum in the industry. “Being a wellness and bathroom brand, we expect the government will protect vital industries’ long-term growth while appropriately preserving their flexibility. The budget is expected to guarantee the formulation of the National Retail Policy and provide a financing window reserved for retailers and distributors. Moreover, the tax benefits for middle-income earners could put more money in consumers’ pockets, leading to a rise in retail spending. Further, we expect continued support for e-commerce through policy changes to incentivise digital adoption which could benefit online retailers”, Anil Kumar Ahuja, Founder, Colston.

Union Budget 2024 Live Updates: Budget expected to accelerate financial services and fintech sector reforms “For India to become a $7 trillion economy financial services and fintech sector has a crucial multiplier role to play. We expect the pace of reforms to accelerate with the upcoming budget. The focus of the reforms has to be on creating more large scale balance sheets, infusing digital and AI in the financial services operating model to drive efficiency, with exceptional focus on governance and risk. Driving better partnerships between fintechs and unlocking more pools of domestic and global capital to fund these balance sheets plus technology will be crucial” says Yashraj Erande, Managing Director and Partner, BCG.

Union Budget 2024 Live Updates: Modi 3.0 budget set to revolutionize fintech sector with innovation and inclusion As we step into the Modi 3.0 era, expectations run high for groundbreaking reforms in the fintech sector.

We foresee targeted incentives for startups, streamlined regulatory frameworks, and enhanced digital infrastructure. This will attract international investments and democratize financial services, empowering millions across urban and rural landscapes. The government’s commitment to a digital-first economy should translate into policies that encourage the adoption of cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, AI, and cybersecurity. Moreover, special focus on bridging the digital divide and enhancing financial literacy will be crucial. As India advances towards a $5 trillion economy, the fintech sector stands at the threshold of unprecedented growth, driven by visionary budgetary support and a steadfast resolve for a financially inclusive future,” said Rashmi Saluja, executive chairperson of Religare Enterprises.

Union Budget 2024 Live Updates: Manufacturing sector looks to Budget 2024 for technological advancements and policy support “The policy to encourage the manufacturing sector toward technological advances must befocused on as we look ahead to the Union Budget 2024.

Union Budget 2024: Why India Has Two Budgets This Year India has two budgets this year due to the recent general elections. The Interim Budget, presented before the election, was a temporary measure to ensure continuous government funding until a new government took office. The upcoming Full Budget, to be presented by the newly elected government, outlines the detailed financial plan for the fiscal year, including revenue, spending, and economic policies. The Interim Budget is a limited version, only covering essential expenses until the new government takes over. In contrast, the full budget is a detailed financial plan, outlining the government’s vision for the entire year. This includes allocations for various sectors, tax proposals, and initiatives to boost economic growth.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/budget-2024-live-updates-date-time-expectations-tax-slabs-gst-nirmala-sitharaman-pm-modi-union-budget-2024-latest-news-liveblog-8962282.html
news18.com,Budget 2024: Paving Way For A Unified Landscape In The Oil And Gas Sector,"The Union Budget 2024 is on the anvil and the anticipation for various tax-related proposals across sectors is growing. The oil and gas sector too has an elaborate wish list seeking policy initiatives and reforms to boost domestic oil production and exploration, incentivising green hydrogen projects, measures to increase the consumption of gas and adoption of alternative fuels.

The pivotal concern of the sector has been the inclusion of petroleum and natural gas under the GST framework. It is relevant to mention that while enacting the Constitution 101st Amendment Act, 2016, petroleum products were consciously included within the scope of the GST legislation (unlike alcoholic liquor for human consumption), however, the levy was deferred. Therefore, while the levy on such products is imposable only upon the recommendation of the GST Council, an announcement in the Budget of the Government’s intent to realise this goal soon will certainly be a step forward in this direction.

A GST-based taxation system for the oil and gas sector is imperative to alleviate the adverse economic consequences being faced by producers due to exorbitantly high taxes and production costs on account of rising global crude prices. Further, the varying rates of VAT being imposed by various states on these products being replaced by a uniform rate of GST will aid in addressing the disparity in fuel prices across the country. It is needless to add that a seamless flow of input tax credit will lead to significant cost savings and unlock supply chain efficiencies, thus encouraging greater investment opportunities in the sector.

The inclusion of natural gas in GST will be in line with the Government’s strategic goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2070 and increase the gas share in the overall energy mix. The Government mandate for implementation of phased mandatory blending of compressed biogas (CBG) with CNG and PNG is a key step towards moving to a gas-based economy and transition to green energy. To further bolster the growth, the industry is expecting fiscal incentives to encourage setting up more CBG plants, directives for pipeline connectivity to CBG plants to allow greater production and offtake of CBG along with enhanced support for research and development in the biogas space.

Navigating the complex political landscape is the biggest challenge in the journey towards realising the goal of a uniform tax landscape for oil and gas sector. Considering that VAT/sales tax levied by States on petrol, diesel, and natural gas accounts as the major revenue source, reaching a consensus among the Centre and States will be a mammoth feat. In a PIL filed before the Hon’ble Kerala High Court, the Court had directed the Union Government and GST Council to furnish reasons for not including the said products within the ambit of GST. However, the 45th GST Council meeting witnessed vehement opposition from several States to the proposal, resulting in yet another deadlock.

The concern of revenue loss for States may call for a compensation mechanism, and the Centre is unlikely to tread this path. Apart from this, GST rate determination will be another challenge, considering the existing revenue share of the Centre and States from excise and VAT respectively. Any anomaly in the GST rate structure could lead to price volatility, which in turn could fuel political resistance and opposition, defeating the very purpose intended to be achieved through any such reform.

Although the industry remains hopeful and geared up for the inclusion of oil and gas under GST, it remains to be seen whether the Budget can facilitate the much-awaited breakthrough on this front, or will it be yet another hit-and-miss.

news18.com,Budget 2024: Income Tax Expectations From Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman,"As India gets ready for the first Union Budget of the government’s third term, there is heightened anticipation surrounding potential reforms in personal taxation. This year, stakeholders are particularly focused on several key areas that could impact individuals and senior citizens, as well as influence investment behaviour in capital markets and derivatives trading.



The current tax structure under the simplified tax regime features multiple brackets ranging from 5% to 30%, causing complexity and administrative burden. Authorities are expected to continue focusing on the new regime and, to simplify it, may seek to consolidate tax rates into broader categories.

Old vs New Tax Regime

If policymakers intend to make the new regime more acceptable vis-a-vis the old regime, the tax slab rates will certainly need a re-jig such as reducing the number of tax slabs to three: 10%, 20%, and 30%, thereby eliminating intermediate tax rates and slabs. This would simplify tax planning and compliance for taxpayers across various income levels, making the new regime more attractive.

Additionally, to alleviate the burden of rising living costs, authorities may enhance the standard deduction from the current Rs 50,000 to Rs 150,000, aiming to provide relief to taxpayers by offsetting everyday expenses against taxable income.

Introducing a leave travel allowance under the simplified regime could also make the regime more attractive and boost the domestic travel industry, on the other hand. Such measures will not only make the new regime lucrative but also give much-needed purchasing power in the hands of the common man.

Recognising the financial challenges faced by senior citizens, particularly in the wake of inflation and increasing healthcare costs, policymakers may like to tweak the slab rates under the new regime by increasing the basic exemption limit under the simplified regime from Rs 300,000 to Rs 700,000. This adjustment aims to reduce the tax liability for elderly taxpayers with limited sources of income.

Standard Deduction

Additionally, a higher standard deduction of Rs 200,000 for senior citizens, up from the current Rs 50,000, can help offset the medical benefits and fixed deposit deductions provided under Chapter VIA as part of the old regime.

The current capital gains tax framework is perceived as intricate, with varying rates and holding period requirements across different asset classes. To foster a more equitable and investor-friendly environment, authorities may consider a unified tax rate for long-term capital gains across all asset classes, potentially adjusting rates for listed equity shares and real estate to provide consistency and predictability for investors.

Rationalising the holding periods required to qualify for long-term capital gains, and ensuring uniformity and clarity across listed and unlisted shares and other assets, is another possible reform. Further, allowing the offsetting of long-term capital losses against short-term gains would provide investors with greater flexibility in managing their tax liabilities.

In the realm of international transactions, recent changes imposing Tax Collection at Source (TCS) on remittances under the liberalised scheme have sparked concerns among stakeholders, particularly in sectors such as employee stock options where 20% TCS is required to be collected on remittance. Authorities may consider adjustments or discontinuation of TCS on remittances related to employee stock option plans, aligning with existing tax deductions under section 192 to avoid double taxation and administrative complexity.

Futures and Options

With the proliferation of derivatives trading, there is growing scrutiny over the taxation of gains from futures and options (F&O). Exploring the classification of gains from F&O trading as speculative income and potentially increasing transaction costs aims to discourage excessive speculation and promote stability in financial markets.

As these proposed reforms are deliberated, the overarching goal remains to create a more streamlined, equitable, and predictable tax environment. By addressing the complexities and challenges faced by various segments of the population, the government aims to foster economic growth, improve taxpayer compliance, and enhance overall financial well-being. Stakeholders eagerly await the final decisions, hopeful that the upcoming Budget will bring much-needed clarity and relief.

news18.com,How Union Budget 2024 Can Supercharge India’s Fintech Sector,"As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gears up to the Narendra Modi-led NDA government’s 11th Budget in July, the nation awaits with bated breath, hope, and expectation. While the Indian economy has recovered from the aftershocks of Covid, registering a GDP growth of 8.2% in the financial year 2023-2024 (FY), there is considerable anticipation after precursor that the Budget would be an “effective document of the government’s far-reaching policies and futuristic vision” of a prosperous India or Viksit Bharat.

While every Budget brings its air of expectations, this would surely be the opportune moment to bring impetus to the fintech sector and unlock its next growth phase. Through specific regulations, electronic payments, and increased credit assistance for MSMEs, the fintech sector is essential for financial inclusion and economic development. With over 6,000 fintech businesses, India is the global hub of innovation and boasts of the third largest ecosystem. This Budget has the potential to create a more resilient economic future by merging the Digital India agenda with the capabilities of the fintech sector, fostering innovation and growth.

Adding The Unbanked Populace To The Formal Economy

The National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024 data highlights the need to bridge the gap between traditional finance and underserved populations. With financial inclusion central to the fintech sector, the Budget must focus on introducing measures, and expanding the digital infrastructure in rural and remote areas is crucial for ensuring everyone has access to basic financial services.

Moreover, targeted subsidies and incentives for fintech companies would go a long way in developing products for low-income groups and could drive innovation aimed at addressing the unique challenges faced by these populations. By aligning business interests with social goals, the government can create a win-win situation where financial inclusion becomes both a viable business proposition and a driver of inclusive economic growth.

At the same time, access to financial services can promote investments in human capital, decrease susceptibility to economic shocks, and create more employment opportunities. For example, most Indians who live in emerging metros and small towns, including MSMEs, find it difficult to obtain credit via conventional lending channels on time because they lack basic banking facilities and credit history.

As per RBI’s classification, tier-3 and tier-4 cities have populations between 10,000 – 49,999 people. These are the cities that lack access to financial products and services. These localities face challenges due to limited financial literacy and inadequate banking infrastructure. Due to their low penetration, improving access to diverse financial services in these regions is crucial.

Continue to Empower MSMEs

It is essential to support MSMEs as they are the backbone of the economy, and the Budget should prioritize facilitating smoother credit flow for them, alongside offering incentives for small-sized banks. This strategic approach will empower businesses in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, providing them with the necessary resources to thrive. The government has already allocated substantial funds to support MSMEs; for instance, the Interim Budget earmarked ₹22,137.95 crores, including a ₹9,000 crore infusion into the Credit Guarantee Fund and a ₹10,000 crore fund for technology and infrastructure development. Incentives for MSMEs, fiscal support for banks, and digital credit assessment can bridge the credit gap and boost MSME contributions. The Union Budget presents an opportunity to enhance regulatory frameworks, introduce improved tax benefits, and boost infrastructure for digital payments, thereby catalyzing MSME growth and facilitating digital integration.

Establishing A Well-Defined Regulatory Framework

A well-defined regulatory framework can significantly benefit fintech companies, as clear and concise regulations can help emerging fintechs establish themselves despite limited time and resources. A streamlined framework can promote innovation and development rather than force businesses to navigate legal complexities. The Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) is anticipated to establish a strong credit flow to merchants across India, including Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Additionally, a uniform KYC framework would be crucial to reducing compliance costs and enhancing operational efficiency.

Strategic Partnerships

The Budget stands to gain significantly from prioritizing partnerships between large public sector banks (PSBs) and fintech companies. Such alliances could leverage the respective strengths of both sectors, integrating the extensive reach and credibility of PSBs with the advanced technologies of fintech firms, thereby yielding substantial benefits for the underbanked population. PSBs have invested substantially in transformative technologies such as AI and blockchain to enhance customer engagement and operational efficiency. Additionally, policies supporting innovation and the deployment of fintech solutions would play a pivotal role in advancing the objective of financial inclusion.

Integration with AI

Government investment in AI-driven solutions promises to bridge language barriers across India, particularly by promoting economic opportunities in rural areas. Beyond rural settings, AI’s transformative impact extends to urban India, revolutionizing customer service and enhancing overall efficiency.

As we await the Budget, the expectations for measures that will unlock the full potential of the fintech sector are high. With the right policies and investments, this Budget can pave the way for a fintech landscape that is more advanced, inclusive, and integrated into the broader economy. This is an exciting time for fintech, and with the anticipated support, the sector is well-positioned to drive significant economic and social progress, in the years to come.

news18.com,"GST Cut On Life Insurance, Tax Exemption On Health Plans; Top Demands From Budget 2024","Union Budget 2024: India’s insurance sector has some key expectations for the upcoming Union Budget 2024, primarily focused on tax benefits and regulatory changes to make insurance products more attractive and accessible to a wider audience.

Bringing down the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate applicable to insurance products, particularly health insurance, is among the major expectations. This would make them more affordable for consumers.



An increase in the deduction limits under Section 80D for health insurance premiums paid for oneself, dependents, and senior citizen parents is anticipated. This would provide greater tax relief for healthcare expenses.

Here’s what industry leaders want from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget 2024;

Increase the Upper Limit For Tax Exemption

Rakesh Jain, CEO of Reliance General Insurance said that the upcoming Union Budget 2024 presents an opportunity to promote sustainable development goals by prioritising risk management and protection.

Jain recommends that the government consider the following measures:

Increase the upper limit for tax exemption on health insurance premiums to Rs 75,000.

Introduce financial support or tax benefits for extensive insurance on electric vehicles (EVs).

Give tax advantages for cyber insurance, particularly for small and medium businesses, to enhance their ability to withstand cyber risks and data breaches.

Mandate health insurance to all employers for their employees to bring holistic protection to the working class.

“Implementing these measures will not only create a more resilient and sustainable economic environment but also pave the way for a healthier and greener future, fostering a sense of optimism and progress,” Jain added.

Lower GST On Life Insurance Products

Tarun Chugh, MD & CEO, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, said, “With increased earning power and disposable income, Indian citizens will be able to invest in versatile life insurance products for their peace of mind and financial goals. Given the under penetration of life insurance in the country, there is substantial room for sectoral growth.”

Chugh added that some of the sector’s budget expectations from the finance ministry is to consider lower GST on life insurance products.

Additionally, in the pension products category, to secure the post-retirement financial needs of the individuals, “we urge the government to align life insurance annuity or pension products with the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and allow the similar additional deduction of Rs. 50,000 or more for life insurance annuity or pension products under Income Tax,” Chugh urged.

Long-Term Capital Gain On High-Value Products

Chugh also urged the ministry to introduce Long Term Capital Gain taxability for all high-value traditional life insurance plans (more than Rs.5 lakhs aggregate annual premium), in line with high-value ULIPs.

“This will bring in uniformity and tax efficiency for insurance customers at par with other similar financial products in the market.”

Affordability and Accessibility

Neel Chheda, Chief of Underwriting and Data Science, TATA AIG General Insurance, said, “We are hopeful for policy measures that will further bolster the insurance sector. We anticipate initiatives that enhance the affordability and accessibility of insurance products, particularly for underserved segments. Increasing tax incentives for insurance offerings would significantly encourage more individuals to secure comprehensive coverage, providing them with financial protection against unforeseen events.”

“Additionally, we look forward to regulatory reforms that support digital innovation and simplify compliance processes, enabling insurers to deliver more efficient and customer-centric services,” Chheda added.

news18.com,Budget 2024: Govt May Relax 45-day Payment Rule For MSMEs,"Union Budget 2024: The government may relax the requirement of making payments to MSMEs within 45 days of buying goods and services to check large corporates from looking at other sourcing avenues.



The government is considering suggestions regarding changes to Section 43B(h) of the Income Tax Act made by MSMEs during pre-Budget consultations, sources told news agency PTI.

Budget 2024 Date

An announcement to this effect could be made in the Budget likely to be presented on July 23.

The government in last year’s Budget added a new clause under Section 43B of the Income Tax Act to address the challenge of delayed payments faced by MSMEs in the country.

Section 43B(h)

According to Section 43B(h) of the Income Tax Act, introduced through the Finance Act 2023, if a larger company does not pay an MSME on time — within 45 days in case of written agreements — it cannot deduct that expense from its taxable income, leading to potentially higher taxes.

MSMEs’ Fear

MSMEs fear that due to this provision, large buyers could cold-shoulder MSME suppliers and start buying either from those MSMEs that are not registered with Udyam or from non-MSMEs.

The amendment was brought in for MSMEs to get timely payment, but there are a lot of fear were raised by them, sources said, adding that they feared that large corporate, in bid to safeguard their interest, can shift their sourcing requirement to bigger firms or ask their vendors to give up their MSME registration to do business with them.

Earlier in May, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the changes, if any, to the rule will have to be done in the full Budget in July under the new government as per the representations submitted by MSMEs.

The MSME sector accounts for 30 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and the second largest employer after agriculture.

The share of exports from products specified for MSMEs constituted 45.56 per cent of the country’s total exports.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/budget-2024-govt-may-relax-45-day-payment-rule-for-msmes-8960825.html
news18.com,What Will India's Energy Sector Get From Budget 2024? Check Top Expectations,"Union Budget 2024: The energy sector in India has a range of expectations from the Budget 2024. These expectations stem from the need to address various challenges and opportunities in the industry, including the push for renewable energy, energy security, infrastructure development, and regulatory reforms.

Ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25, key industry leaders emphasise the need for strong governmental actions to promote cleaner energy and sustainable growth.

Suyash Gupta, Director General of the Indian Auto LPG Coalition, highlights the environmental and economic benefits of Auto LPG, urging the government to reduce GST on Auto LPG from 18% to 5%. He believes this change, alongside incentives for OEMs to produce more LPG vehicles, will encourage wider adoption, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to traditional fuels.

Alessandro Des Dorides, CEO of Nayara Energy, stresses the importance of prioritising energy security by encouraging investments in refining and petrochemical capacities through tax incentives and streamlined clearances. He also supports continuing the ethanol blending program and incentives for green hydrogen to accelerate India’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

Arun Awasthy, President & Managing Director of Johnson Controls India, calls for detailed road maps to bridge the gap between sustainability goals and actions. He advocates for the upcoming budget to focus on enhancing energy efficiency in building infrastructure and strengthening green technology skilling and innovation initiatives.

These leaders urge the government to adopt policies fostering sustainable development, economic growth, and environmental protection.

‘Worsening Environmental Health’

Gupta added that the rapidly worsening environmental health and its significant impact on public health call for strong government actions to encourage cleaner mobility and a healthier environment.

“The 2024-25 budget should encourage OEMs to roll out LPG vehicles at affordable prices, boosting consumer demand and speeding up adoption. This strategy will not only provide more fuel and technology options for the public but also expand the government’s choices for public mobility fuel,” Gupta added.

Gupta added that by reducing the GST on Auto LPG and encouraging OEMs to roll out more LPG variants through fiscal incentives similar to those for EVs, we can make this cleaner fuel more accessible to the masses, encouraging its adoption and supporting the transition to a more sustainable energy future.

Currently, Auto LPG is subjected to a high GST rate of 18%, whereas the adoption of EVs is heavily subsidised.

“This disparity creates a barrier for consumers and businesses considering the switch to Auto LPG. Reducing the GST to 5% would make Auto LPG more competitively priced, fostering greater adoption and supporting the auto industry’s shift towards greener technologies,” Gupta highlighted.

“We urge the Finance Ministry to consider our appeal for a GST reduction on the fuel, kits and OE LPG vehicles, which will significantly contribute to our shared vision of a cleaner and greener India.”

Energy Security Of India

Dorides from Nayara Energy, anticipate a budget that prioritises the energy security of the nation.

India, being the fastest growing economy in the world, has a high energy demand, and there is a need to encourage investments in expanding refining and petrochemical capacities, Dorides added.

“Offering tax incentives, supporting faster clearances, facilitating land acquisition, etc. will encourage both domestic and foreign investments. Investment schemes for the petrochemical industry will enhance the country’s self-sufficiency and promote substantial investment which will generate huge employment and aid the creation of surrounding infrastructure facilities,” Dorides underlined.

Blending of Ethanol

Dorides also noted that the Government has set a target of 20% blending of ethanol in petrol/gasoline by 2025 and the early success of the program has well-positioned India on a sustainable growth path.

“This should be continued to further accelerate India’s transition towards a low-carbon economy the government could consider incentivising users to replace grey hydrogen with green hydrogen, providing incentives for corporates to fund R&D by premier or dedicated Indian research institutes for developing transformative technologies, developing centralised or shared renewable energy storage systems, amongst other initiatives,” Dorides added.

New Green Deal

Arun Awasthy from Johnson Controls India pointed out that in the interim budget, the government outlined the New Green Deal, demonstrating its commitment to achieving green growth and sustainable development.

The provisions under this though predominantly focused on aspects of renewable energy and clean fuels, we are optimistic that the upcoming Union Budget, building on this, will drive focus towards strengthening the energy efficiency of India’s building infrastructure (built environment), considering its potential to bring down the national carbon emissions disproportionately,” Awasthy hoped.

Green Tech

Awasthy also urged that provisions to bolster the skilling and innovation initiatives about green technology will be key in bridging the existing gaps.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/union-budget-2024-expectations-energy-sector-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-8960460.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024: Healthcare Sector Seeks GST Relief, Incentives In R&D, Local Manufacturing","Union Budget 2024: The Indian healthcare sector has high expectations for the upcoming budget on July 23rd, 2024. Experts anticipate a significant rise in healthcare spending. Investments in rural healthcare facilities and primary care are also expected to receive a boost

The government might introduce policies to improve the quality and accessibility of essential healthcare services. Lowering the GST on these services is a potential option.



Dr Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, MD and CEO, Fortis Healthcare, highlighted that while the interim budget introduced several initiatives, the upcoming budget should prioritise healthcare infrastructure by increasing GDP spending to 2.5%.

“We urge the government to designate healthcare as a national priority and implement transformative measures to establish India as a global healthcare powerhouse,” Raghuvanshi urged.

Key Issues In Healthcare

Raghuvanshi underlined that the healthcare sector currently faces challenges such as a shortage of skilled workforce, indirect taxation issues, and unused Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credit.

“To ensure sustained and accelerated growth, policies conducive to private sector investment must be focused upon,” he stressed.

“The government should strengthen public-private partnerships by introducing new models and policies to boost the adoption of digital healthcare services and promote medical value travel. This can be achieved by facilitating international insurance recognition for Indian healthcare providers to attract more international patients,” Raghuvanshi urged.

Diagnostics Sector

The diagnostics sector, vital for early disease detection and treatment customisation, is crucial in India’s growth, said Ameera Shah, Executive Chairperson and Whole Time Director, Metropolis Healthcare.

“We urge the new government to prioritise optimising PPP models to ensure high-quality, positive, and impactful outcomes. Increased funding for screening and diagnostic programs targeting Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as cancer and cardiac ailments is essential. Investing in training for doctors, nurses, and allied healthcare workers will further elevate the quality of care,” Shah said.

0% GST On Diagnostic Services

Shah demanded that implementing a 0% GST on diagnostic services and facilitating refunds for GST paid on input tax credits can reduce costs and improve accessibility.

Lowering customs duty on imported diagnostic equipment and adjusting high GST rates on lab supplies will enhance efficiencies and foster R&D investments, he added.

“These measures will significantly contribute to our shared goal of providing accessible, high-quality healthcare for all. We look forward to collaborating with the government to address these priorities and ensure the continued growth and improvement of India’s healthcare sector,” Shah noted.

Increase Healthcare Spending

Dr Sabine Kapasi, Gynecologist, Co-Founder and MD at Enira Consulting, and Global strategy lead at United Nations Emergency Response, UNDAC, too highlighted that healthcare sector stakeholders are calling for significant reforms.

“They suggest increasing healthcare spending to 3% of GDP, improving infrastructure in rural and underserved areas, and strengthening preventive healthcare. Addressing the shortage of healthcare workers through better training and working conditions is also essential,” Kapasi urged.

Health Insurance Ambit

Kapasi also highlighted the need of expanding health insurance coverage, adopting advanced technologies like telemedicine and digital health records, and complying with the India Digital Personal Data Protection Act of 2023

The focus on emerging technologies such as AI and Machine Learning in the interim budget highlights the push for modernisation in the sector, she added.

Incentives For R&D, Local Manufacturing

In terms of tax policy, Kapasi said it is important to incentivise local manufacturing and R&D activities.

“Providing clarity on GST for business expenses and aligning rates for pharmaceutical ingredients are crucial for operational efficiency. Simplifying regulations and offering incentives for innovation and skill development can strengthen India’s healthcare capabilities and competitiveness,” Kapasi urged.

Kapasi added that by investing in infrastructure, technology, human resources, and clear regulations, the government can improve public health outcomes and support the growth of the pharmaceutical sector. Meeting these goals will be a significant step towards a healthier and more prosperous India.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/budget-2024-healthcare-sector-seeks-gst-relief-incentives-in-rd-local-manufacturing-8959582.html

Meanwhile, the shares of other railway companies also soared high to touch their new peaks today. Shares of Texmaco Rail & Engineering rose 8.3 per cent to its new 52-week high of Rs 295.65, while those of RailTel surged 7.5 per cent to its new peak at Rs 559.35.

Ircon International and Oriental Rail Infrastructure shares also jumped up to 6.64 per cent to their new highs while RITES shares went up by 4.5 per cent on BSE to the day’s high of Rs 797.

Vaishnav’s announcement of the production of 50 new Amrit Bharat Trains – a high-speed and luxury train service – added to the rally in railway stocks.

Expectations of special focus on the railway infrastructure in the Union Budget have helped push the stocks higher. The government is focusing on improving the railway infrastructure and ensuring faster development and completion of tracks, rail electrification, rolling stock manufacturing and delivery of passenger freight services.

Narendra Modi government’s focus on infrastructure building, especially through domestic manufacturing in sectors such as railways, defence, and power has boosted stocks from these spaces in last few years.

Now, with BJP-led NDA retaining power for a third term, investors are hopeful of policy continuity. In an earlier note, Goldman Sachs had said that it expects continued thrust on infrastructure creation through the development of railways.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting the Union Budget that will lay the roadmap of Modi 3.0 on July 23 in Lok Sabha. The Parliamentary session for the Budget will commence on July 22 and continue till August 22.

In the last year, railway stocks have benefited their investors by giving multibagger returns. IRFC has given returns of 505 per cent.

The Finance Ministry in a statement said the pre-budget consultations for Union Budget 2024-25 that started from June 19 onward concluded on July 5, 2024.



Union Budget 2024 Date

Sitharaman will present her seventh Budget on July 23. This would be the first full budget of Modi 3.0 which is going to set the path for Vikshit Bharat (developed India) by 2047.

Last month, President Droupadi Murmu, while delivering her address to the joint sitting of Parliament, had said that many historic steps and major economic decisions will be taken in the upcoming budget session.

In her first address to the joint sitting of Parliament since the constitution of the 18th Lok Sabha, the President said, “This budget will be an effective document of the government’s far-reaching policies and futuristic vision”.

“Along with major economic and social decisions, many historic steps will also be seen in this budget,” she said.

Budget 2024 Consultations

In the course of in-person consultations, more than 120 invitees across 10 stakeholder groups, including experts and representatives from farmer associations and agriculture economists; trade unions; education & health sector; employment & skilling; MSME; trade & services; industry; economists; financial sector & capital markets; as well as, infrastructure, energy and urban sector, participated in the meetings, it said.

During the consultations, Sitharaman thanked the participants for sharing valuable suggestions and assured experts and representatives that their suggestions would be carefully examined and considered while preparing the Union Budget 2024-25.

Union Budget 2024 Expectations

With India’s strong GDP growth, the budget will likely prioritise infrastructure development in areas like railways, renewable energy, and defence.

An increase in the standard deduction limit for income tax is a popular expectation, offering some relief to salaried taxpayers

The budget might offer clarity on whether the government will incentivise people to shift towards the new tax regime or retain the existing structure with deductions.

Measures like increased interest rate subsidies for housing loans could be announced to stimulate the real estate sector.

The budget proposal for the financial year ending March 2025 will be presented on July 23.



Goldman economists expect the government to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 5.1% of GDP set in the interim budget but said it will likely make an “overarching statement” about long-term economic policy.

“We see an emphasis on job creation through labour-intensive manufacturing, credit for micro, small and medium enterprises, continued focus on services exports by expanding global capability centres, and a thrust on domestic food supply chain,” news agency Reuters quoted Santanu Sengupta, chief India economist at the Wall Street, as saying in the note.

Goldman expects the budget to push labor-intensive manufacturing through fiscal incentives across sectors like toys, textiles and apparel manufacturing, along with commercial aircraft manufacturing.

Citi, in a report, said the government could consider extending its flagship production-linked incentive scheme with a focus on “more domestic value addition and explicit employment targets.”

Goldman also expects a focus on agricultural infrastructure and incentives to increase domestic production of key crops as a way to target high food inflation, which has been running close to 8% for many months.

This Budget, the central government employee union has also sent a proposal to the Cabinet Secretary comprising 7 demands, including the immediate constitution of the 8th Pay Commission and the release of the 18-month arrears of the COVID-19 period.

In a letter to the Cabinet Secretary on July 6, the Confederation of Central Govt Employees and Workers has made several demands ahead of the Budget 2024:

1) Immediate Constitution of the 8th Pay Commission.

2) Scrap the New Pension Scheme (NPS), and Restore the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) for all employees.

3) To release the 18-month DA/ DR which was frozen during the COVID-19 pandemic to employees and pensioners, restoration of commuted part of pension after 12 years instead of 15 years at present.

4) Remove the 5 per cent ceiling on the compassionate appointments, grant compassionate appointments to all the wards/ dependents of the deceased employee.

5) Full up all vacant posts of all the cadres in all departments, stop outsourcing and contractorisation in government departments.

6) Ensure the democratic functioning of association/ federations as per provisions of JCM mechanism.

(A) Grant recognition to associations/ federations which are pending, withdraw the de-recognition orders of Postal Group C Union, NFPE, ISROSA.

(B) Stop imposition of Rule 15 1(c) on service association/ federations.

7) Regularise casual, contractual labourers and GDS employees, grant equal status to employees of autonomous bodies to that of CG employees.

For these demands, the confederation will also conduct a demonstration on July 19 during the lunch hours.

“We want the implementation of the 8th Pay Commission from January 2026. For this, the commission has to be constituted immediately,” said S B Yadav, general secretary of the Confederation.

Upcoming DA Hike Under 7th Pay Commission

The central government is likely to announce the DA hike for the existing 7th Pay Commission employees in the first half of September, which will become effective retrospectively from July 1, 2024. Employees expect a 3-4 per cent hike in the upcoming DA hike.

On asked if the government can increase DA further despite the 50 per cent threshold of DA as a percentage of the basic pay, a labour affairs expert said, “Yes, the government can increase the DA more than 50 per cent also. In the 4th Pay Commission, the DA had reached as high as 170 per cent. However, the government gave interim relief as well.”",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/economy/8th-pay-commission-da-arrears-old-pension-scheme-govt-employee-union-has-7-demands-ahead-of-budget-2024-8958793.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024: Govt Mulls Doubling Ayushman Bharat Beneficiaries, Insurance Amount","The government is actively considering doubling the beneficiary base under its flagship Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme over the next three years, with all those aged above 70 years to be brought under its ambit, to begin with, and also increase the insurance coverage to Rs 10 lakh per year.

According to a report by news agency PTI, the proposals, if given a go-ahead, would entail an additional expenditure of Rs 12,076 crore per annum for the exchequer as per estimates prepared by the National Health Authority.

“Discussions are happening to double the beneficiary base under the AB-PMJAY over the next three years, which, if implemented, will cover more than two-thirds population of the country with health cover, the sources said while noting that medical expenditure is one of the biggest reasons that push families to indebtedness.

“Deliberations are also underway over finalising a proposal to double the limit of the coverage amount from the existing Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh,” they said.

These proposals or some parts of them are expected to be announced in the Union Budget to be presented later this month.

President Droupadi Murmu, in her address to the joint sitting of Parliament on June 27, had said all the elderly above 70 years of age will also be covered and get the benefit of free treatment under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana now.

Those above 70 years of age add up to around 4-5 crore more beneficiaries being covered under the scheme, another source told PTI.

The limit of Rs 5 lakh for AB-PMJAY was fixed in 2018. Doubling the cover amount is aimed at catering to inflation and providing relief to families in case of high-cost treatments such as transplants, cancer, etc.

In the interim Budget 2024, the government increased the allocation for the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), which provides health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to 12 crore families, to Rs 7,200 crore while Rs 646 crore was assigned for the Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM).

The NITI Aayog, in its report titled ‘Health Insurance for India’s Missing Middle’ published in October 2021, suggested extending the scheme. It stated that about 30 percent of the population is devoid of health insurance, highlighting the gaps in health insurance coverage across the Indian population.

The AB-PMJAY flagship scheme towards Universal Health Coverage, and state government extension schemes provides comprehensive hospitalisation coverage to the bottom 50 per cent of the population.

Around 20 per cent of the population is covered through social health insurance, and private voluntary health insurance is primarily designed for high-income groups.

The remaining 30 per cent of the population is devoid of health insurance, the actual uncovered population is higher due to existing coverage gaps in PMJAY and overlap between schemes. This uncovered population is termed as the missing middle, the report stated.

The missing middle is not a monolith - it contains multiple groups across all expenditure quintiles. The missing middle predominantly constitutes the self-employed (agriculture and non-agriculture) informal sector in rural areas, and a broad array of occupations — informal, semi-formal, and formal — in urban areas, the report said.

The report highlighted the need for designing a low-cost comprehensive health insurance product for the missing middle.

It primarily recognises the policy issue of low financial protection for health for the missing middle segment and highlights health insurance as a potential pathway in addressing that.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-govt-mulls-doubling-ayushman-bharat-beneficiaries-insurance-amount-8957595.html
news18.com,Budget 2024: DPIIT Recommends Removal Of Angel Tax On Startups,"Ahead of the Union Budget, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has recommended the removal of angel tax on startups, but an integrated view will be taken by the finance ministry, a senior government official said.

In September last year, the Income Tax Department notified new angel tax rules that comprise a mechanism to evaluate the shares issued by unlisted startups to investors.

While previously the angel tax — a tax levied on capital received on the sale of shares of a startup above the fair market value — applied only to local investors, the Budget for the 2023-24 fiscal (April 2023 to March 2024) widened its ambit to include foreign investments.

Replying to a query on industry demand for the removal of angel tax here on Thursday, DPIIT Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said: “Based on the consultation with the startup ecosystem that we have here we have recommended that in the past as well and I think we have recommended it this time also but ultimately an integrated view will be taken by the Ministry of Finance.”

As per the Budget, the excess premium will be considered as ‘income from sources’ and taxed at the rate of up to over 30 per cent. However, startups registered by the DPIIT are exempt from the new norms.

To a query on Tesla, Singh said “the last we have heard from them” was in the week the results of general election was announced.

“Let’s see. But the process of finalising the guidelines (for EVs) is on by the Ministry of Heavy Industries. They have more than one enquiry I understand…,” he said.

On June 7, days after the declaration of the results of the general election, American tech billionaire Elon Musk in a post on X said he is looking forward to his companies doing “exciting work” in India as he congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his historic election victory.

The congratulatory message came two months after the CEO of the electric carmaker Tesla and microblogging platform X in April postponed his proposed visit to India due to “very heavy Tesla obligations”.

Musk — who was expected to be in India on April 21 and 22 and scheduled to meet Prime Minister Modi — later wrote on X that he is looking forward to coming to India later this year.

In June last year, Musk met with Modi during the latter’s US visit and stated that he planned to visit India in 2024 while expressing confidence that Tesla would enter the Indian market soon.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-dpiit-recommends-removal-of-angel-tax-on-startups-8957565.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Pharma Sector Seeks Tax Benefits, Effective Intellectual Property Rights Regime","Union Budget 2024: All eyes are on the upcoming Union Budget as India’s pharmaceutical industry, a global leader in generics, waits with bated breath. With ambitious targets to not only be the world’s pharmacy but also a hub for innovation, industry leaders have high hopes for budgetary measures that will propel them forward.

Industry bodies have urged that there is a need to incentivise R&D investments, offer corporate tax concessions and establish an effective intellectual property rights regime to push the growth of the domestic pharmaceutical industry.

Outlining the sector’s wish list for the upcoming Union Budget, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) Director General Anil Matai urged the government to explore methods to incentivise R&D investments, such as deductions on R&D expenses, research-linked incentives for MNCs, and corporate tax concessions.



The initiatives will help in accelerating R&D and innovation in the sector, he added.

“Recognising the high-risk, long-gestation nature of R&D, we suggest extending the scope of section 115BAB of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to companies solely engaged in pharmaceutical research and development and providing a 200 per cent deduction rate on R&D expenditures,” Matai said.

This would significantly boost the sector’s ability to undertake essential research and development, including clinical trials and patent registration, he added.

Matai also sought establishing an effective intellectual property rights regime for driving growth and encouraging research-based pharma companies, both global and domestic, to introduce innovative therapies in India towards addressing unmet medical needs.

Besides, he sought introduction of incentives for centres and companies that provide specialised training programmes for pharmaceutical employees.

“Incentives for developing treatments for rare diseases are also crucial,” Matai said.

Besides, enhancing the management of rare diseases through more centres of excellence (CoEs), increased budget allocations for incentivising R&D on therapies for rare disease, and import duty waivers are essential, he noted.

“Expanding the list of life-saving drugs eligible for GST/import duty exemptions, including all oncology medications, will further improve patient affordability,” Matai said.

To attract investment and contribute to a more resilient and future-ready pharmaceutical industry, the government should provide incentives for investments in bonds issued by pharmaceutical companies, he added.

OPPI represents the research-based pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Novartis and Merck, in India.

Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) Secretary General Sudarshan Jain said the policy direction should leverage the industry’s knowledge-driven foundation and the status as a global manufacturing hub.

The thrust should be on quality and innovation, he stated.

Given the high risk, lengthy development periods, and low success rates in research, continuous investment is crucial, he added.

“The 2024-25 budget should introduce policies that provide direct and indirect tax benefits to encourage research and investment in becoming a global benchmark in quality,” Jain said.

IPA is an association of leading research-based pharmaceutical companies in India.

The members include Cipla, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Sun Pharma and Lupin.

news18.com,Budget 2024: Income Tax Standard Deduction For Salaried Employees May Rise To Rs 1 Lakh,"Union Budget 2024: The finance ministry is reportedly considering raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new tax regime while leaving the tax exemption-heavy old regime unchanged.

According to a report by Moneycontrol, the finance minister may consider increasing the standard deduction to up to Rs 1 lakh per annum in the upcoming budget.



To boost disposable income in the hands of taxpayers, the government may increase the standard deduction amount from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh, the report said, quoting industry experts.

According to another report by ToI, the finance ministry is considering raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime while keeping the tax exemption-heavy old regime unchanged.

Furthermore, the rebate under Section 87A was increased for taxable incomes up to Rs 7 lakh under the new tax regime. Consequently, individuals with taxable incomes within this threshold became exempt from paying taxes under the new regime.

The Rs 50,000 Standard Deduction

In the 2023 budget, the finance minister introduced a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for salaried taxpayers and pensioners under the new tax regime. This deduction became the default option unless taxpayers chose to opt-out.

Will Govt Hike Rs 1.5 Lakh Limit Under Section 80C Of Income Tax Act?

Each year, numerous taxpayers anticipate the finance minister increasing the Section 80C limit in the union budget 2024. The current 80C limit has not kept pace with rising incomes and expenses, leading many taxpayers to exhaust the entire limit.

There has been no official announcement regarding an increase in the Section 80C deduction limit for budget 2024. The current limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh has remained unchanged since 2014. Due to rising inflation, many taxpayers and financial experts expect an increase.

Section 80C, a provision under the Income Tax Act of India, allows taxpayers to claim deductions on certain investments and expenses, thereby reducing their taxable income. The maximum deduction limit under Section 80C is Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year.

Tax Limit Expected To Be Increased?

The government is reportedly considering measures to potentially reduce personal income tax rates to bolster GDP growth by stimulating consumption, especially given the subdued spending levels among the middle class.

In the forthcoming budget, the government plans to raise the income threshold for tax liability from the current Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.

This adjustment is aimed exclusively at taxpayers under the new regime, to increase disposable income, particularly among lower-income groups.

news18.com,"Real Estate Expectations from Budget 2024-25: Industry Status, Tax Reliefs, and Affordable Housing Initiatives","Real Estate Expectations from Budget 2024-25: As the newly formed Modi 3.0 government settles in, all eyes are on the upcoming Budget 2024-25, which Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is likely to present on July 23. The real estate sector has high hopes for this budget, with demands ranging from tax reliefs to affordable housing initiatives and land-related announcements.

In the past few years since early 2022, the luxury real estate segment has been gaining fast traction. However, the affordable sector has taken a backseat as compared with the luxury segment. Here are some expectations of the real estate from the upcoming Union Budget 2024-25:

Industry Status for Real Estate

The real estate sector has been advocating for the ‘industry’ status, which it said will attract investments and streamline regulations. This year also, it is reiterating the demand for the real estate sector.

Bhavesh Kothari, founder & CEO of Property First, said, “We urge the finance minister to implement tax reliefs in terms of reduction in GST rate along with an input tax credit on under-construction properties.”

Granting the industry status to real estate will attract investments and streamline regulations, said Pradeep Aggarwal, founder & chairman of Signature Global (India) Ltd, and chairman of the ASSOCHAM National Council on Real Estate, Housing and Urban Development.

Tax Recommendations: Loan Interest Deductions and Capital Gains

The real estate industry is demanding raising interest deduction limit on housing loans under Section 24B from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, apart from reducing holding period from 24 months to 12 months and long-term capital gains tax rate, which is currency levied at 20 per cent.

Currently, interest deductions on home loan is available under two sections — Section 80C and Section 24B.

“This tax deduction should be entirely moved out of Section 80C, since it gets clubbed with other critical instruments such as life insurance, PPF, etc,” said Anshuman Magazine, chairman and CEO (India, South-East Asia, Middle East & Africa) of CBRE, in his Budget 2024-25 recommendations.

He added that the exemption limits have remained stagnant for a long time and have not been indexed to inflation. “We urge the government to raise this limit (Section 24B) to at least Rs 5 lakh per annum.”

Bhavesh Kothari, founder & CEO of Property First, said, “We urge the finance minister to grant industry status to the real estate sector that would be another significant step that would catalyse growth and contribute to the nation’s economy.”

On Affordable Housing

The sector is pressing for the government to raise the cost, size, and income criteria for affordable housing to make it more inclusive.

Currently, the criteria for affordable housing are based on the cost of the property (Rs 45 lakh), carpet area (60 sq. m to 90 sq. m), and income of the homebuyer (EWS / LIG).

“The government should consider increasing the size criteria for metro cities to 90 sq. m. and establishing three to four brackets of unit sizes and prices to define the eligibility criteria depending on city / state dynamics, as capital values in larger metro cities (Mumbai, Delhi-NCR) can be significantly higher vis a vis other cities.” Magazine said.

Signature Global’s Pradeep Aggarwal also said that stakeholders are advocating for raising the affordability cap of housing from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 75 lakhs in metro cities like MMR and NCR to make housing more accessible.

G Hari Babu, national president of NAREDCO, said the government should come up with the second tranche of the Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) fund with Rs 50,000 corpus in the upcoming union budget for FY 2024-2025, along other budgetary support and relaxations including allowing input tax credit under GST and incentives for rental housing in order to achieve the housing for all target.

Land Unlocking and Development

The industry also recommends the government to unlock Port Trust land, railways, and defence unused land parcels.

“We recommend unlocking these land parcels and partnering with credible private developers to develop affordable housing once the land and approvals are in place. These land parcels could also be leveraged for the development of industrial parks and related infrastructure,” said CBRE.

NAREDCO’s G Hari Babu said since the sale of land is exempt and the construction of an area is like a works contract, suitable amendments are to be carried out to set out the exemption and such treatment. Accordingly, since the sale of land is not subject to GST, taxing grant of development rights or long-term lease rights which are in the nature of benefits arising out of land in the manner provided under the Notifications based on the market value of flats / commercial offices, is not appropriate given the nature of the transaction.

Any development agreement granting development rights is no different from any transaction of sale of land for consideration in the form of the construction of an area. The same is the case with the transfer of TDR. It may be noted that in several Supreme court judgements benefits arising from land is held to be “land”, he added.

Boosting Rental Housing

While the passage of the Model Tenancy Act (MTA) is a positive move for the rental housing segment, India continues to be at the lower spectrum of gross rental yields, with most investors historically relying on property price escalation for financial returns.

“The government can consider providing certain exemptions to this segment through a 5-year property tax holiday, facilitating ease of capital for build-to-lease and rent-to-own residential projects by instituting a special fund for such developers, etc,” CBRE said.

Santosh Agarwal, CFO and Executive Director of Alphacorp said, “The budget presents a pivotal opportunity to bring forth a positive change in our urban landscape. A balanced approach that fosters both investment and affordability will not only lead to economic growth but also boost housing demand in the times to come.”",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/real-estate/real-estate-expectations-from-budget-2024-25-industry-status-tax-reliefs-and-affordable-housing-initiatives-8953949.html
news18.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: Will FM Reduce GST On Health Policies? Here’s What Insurers Want,"Union Budget 2024: The health insurance sector in India has high hopes for the upcoming Union Budget 2024. The industry hopes that by implementing some of the measures, the government could significantly boost health insurance penetration and promote financial security for citizens.

Among the key demands, the sector seeks to highlight the current deduction limit for health insurance premiums is seen as inadequate, especially considering rising healthcare costs.



The sector expects a significant increase in the deduction limit for individuals, dependents, and especially senior citizen parents. This would make health insurance more affordable and encourage wider adoption.

Here are some key expectations of the health insurance sector;

Prasun Sikdar, MD & CEO, ManipalCigna Health Insurance, underlines that the Right to Health is a part and parcel of the Right to Life under the Indian Constitution.

“Despite some progress over the years, India’s healthcare spending is still low compared to the global average, necessitating a substantial boost in healthcare spending,” Sikdar said.

“We expect the Finance Minister to announce higher allocation of funds for healthcare compared to what was proposed in the interim budget to meet the targets of the National Health Policy,” Sikdar added.

Reducing Out-of-pocket Expenses

Sikdar added that reducing out-of-pocket expenses is equally critical. Currently, these expenses are still high relative to global standards, indicating a considerable protection gap. Private health insurance is vital in bridging this gap.

Insurance for All by 2047

Sikdar highlighted that the insurance regulator, IRDAI has also set a vision of achieving Insurance for All by 2047, marking a century of India’s independence.

“Our sincere submission to the government is to reduce the current 18% GST rate on essential services like health insurance. Further, specific segment considerations are also required especially for middle-income and senior citizen segments who are struggling to meet the rising healthcare costs,” Sikdar urged.

Reducing GST burden

Sikdar also underlined lowering the GST burden on health insurance premiums will be a huge respite for missing middle and senior citizens to get access to the quality healthcare they need and help to significantly boost insurance penetration across India by driving affordability.

Tax Benefits

Krishnan Ramachandran, MD & CEO, Niva Bupa, said that India is a price-sensitive market where consumers seek maximum value, making tax benefits a significant nudge towards purchasing health insurance.

“The 80D tax exemption should be linked to inflation and revised periodically. Increasing the current limit of Rs 1 lakh for tax deductions would encourage more people to opt for health insurance,” Ramachandran said.

Currently, policyholders can claim deductions of up to Rs 25,000 for parents under 60 and Rs 50,000 for those over 60.

“Raising these limits to Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh, respectively, would further incentivise health insurance for elderly parents. Tax exemptions should also extend to dependent family members like siblings,” Ramachandran urged.

Universal Health Scheme

Dr. S Prakash, MS. FRCS (Glasg), FAIS – MD & CEO Designate, Galaxy Health Insurance Company, said that the Universal Health Scheme requires better implementation, greater participation of multi-specialty and corporate hospitals, and improved reach to the deserving BPL population.

Additionally, uniformity in its implementation across all states needs to be addressed, he said.

Expectations on Having a Health Regulator

Prakash demanded that a Health Regulator can better standardise operating procedures, create effective packages based on the location and expertise available in hospitals, and address unethical practices. This can boost public confidence and improve financial transactions between insurers and hospitals.

Currently, hospitals are somewhat self-regulated despite the existence of the Clinical Establishment Act. There is uncertainty about how uniformly this act is practiced across the country, he added.

Apart from the GST reduction, Prakash also urged to extend 80-D deductions under the New Tax Regime, similar to the Old Tax Regime and include personal accident cover under the 80-D limit ambit.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-expectations-health-insurance-gst-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-8951617.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024: From Interest Subsidy To Tax Relief, Housing Sector Expects Growth and Stability","Union Budget 2024: As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the first budget of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s third term, the real estate sector is teeming with anticipation. Industry players are hopeful for measures that will drive growth and stabilise the market. Key stakeholders have been vocal about their priorities, advocating for reforms and initiatives that address critical challenges and foster sustained development in this pivotal budget.

Tax Incentives for Homebuyers

Prashant Sharma, President, NAREDCO Maharashtra said enhancing tax benefits for homebuyers, especially under Section 80C and Section 24(b), would provide a much-needed boost to housing demand.

“Increasing the limit of deduction on home loan interest will make home ownership more attractive and affordable for the common man,” Sharma added

Sharma also suggested the following measures;

Single Window Clearance: Introducing a single window clearance system for all real estate projects would streamline approval, reducing delays and costs. This measure would accelerate project completion and enhance the ease of doing business in the sector.

Incentives for Affordable Housing: Continued focus on affordable housing is crucial.

“We urge the government to extend the benefits under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and provide additional incentives to developers engaged in affordable housing projects. Also, there’s a need to redefine the definition of affordable housing, proposing an increase in the cap from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 1 crore, particularly in metro cities. This will help bridge the housing gap and provide homes to the economically weaker sections of society, boosting both affordable and mid-segment housing,” Sharma said.

Addressing Liquidity Issues: The real estate sector continues to face liquidity challenges.

“We expect the budget to introduce measures that ensure easier access to financing for developers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. Enhancing the flow of funds through banking and non-banking financial institutions is essential for sustaining project momentum. Also, there’s a need for an increase in the SWAMIH stress fund and the creation of a second tranche with a corpus of Rs 50,000 crore, aimed at completing stalled realty projects and ensuring adequate liquidity.”

Reforms in Land Acquisition: Simplifying land acquisition processes and reducing the costs associated with it will be instrumental in boosting real estate development. Transparent and fair land acquisition policies will encourage more developers to undertake new projects.

Focus on Rental Housing: To cater to the urban population and the migrant workforce, policies promoting rental housing should be prioritised. Incentives for developers to build rental housing projects will help address the housing needs of a diverse population.

Digital Transformation: Encouraging the digital transformation of the real estate sector through technological advancements and digital infrastructure will lead to greater transparency and efficiency. Incentives for adopting PropTech solutions will further modernise the sector.

Infrastructure Status for Real Estate

Pritam Chivukula, Co-Founder & Director, Tridhaatu Realty and Vice President, CREDAI-MCHI,urged granting infrastructure status to the real estate sector.

“It will facilitate easier access to funding at lower interest rates. This move will not only reduce the cost of capital for developers but also accelerate the pace of infrastructure development, leading to overall economic growth,” Chivukula said.

Chivukula also suggested the introduction of policies and incentives to promote rental housing will help address the housing needs of a growing urban population. This includes tax benefits for rental income and schemes to encourage private participation in rental housing projects.

Revival of Stressed Projects

Chivukula highlighted the need for Special provisions and financial packages for the revival of stalled and stressed real estate projects will help protect the interests of homebuyers and ensure the completion of projects. This will also aid in clearing the unsold inventory and reviving the real estate market.

Relaunch of the CLSS Scheme

Mohit Jain, Managing Director, Krisumi Corporation, said, “Given the government’s ongoing push for housing for all, we also anticipate the relaunch of the CLSS scheme, which will boost housing demand across various segments.”

Jain also underlined that the Government should also look at implementing the single window clearance system for all project-related approvals, a long-pending demand of the industry. This will considerably reduce delays thereby benefitting all stakeholders including the government, developers as well as end users i.e. home buyers.

GST Reform in Real Estate

Vedanshu Kedia, Director, Prescon Group, felt the current Goods and Services Tax (GST) structure for the real estate industry needs to be rethought.

“Real estate is the most capital-intensive industry and we feel that allowing an input tax credit for expenses made by real estate companies can not only help real estate developers manage their cash flows better but also help rationalise prices for end users and make it more affordable. We also advocate for the rationalisation of GST rates to ensure they are more straightforward and affordable. A streamlined GST system will reduce the overall cost burden on homebuyers and developers, promoting greater activity in the sector,” Kedia added.

Kedia also urged the government to revise capital gains taxation to make it more favourable for real estate transactions.

NRIs and Real Estate

Kedia pointed out that Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) have always been significant contributors to the Indian real estate market.

“We recommend the introduction of policies that make it easier for NRIs to invest in Indian properties. Simplifying regulations, providing tax benefits, and ensuring a hassle-free repatriation process will attract more NRI investments, thereby boosting the sector,” Kedia added.

Focus on Millennial buyers

Samyak Jain, Director, Siddha Group highlighted that millennials represent a substantial portion of potential homebuyers today. However, increasing property prices and stringent financing options often make homeownership a distant dream for many.

“We urge the government to introduce targeted schemes that cater specifically to millennials and first-time homebuyers. Making homeownership more accessible to this demographic will not only fulfil their aspirations but also inject fresh demand into the housing market,” Samyak urged.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-from-interest-subsidy-to-tax-relief-housing-sector-expects-growth-and-stability-8949512.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024 & Gig Economy: Industry Suggests Safety Net, Skills For Workers","Skill sector firms have proposed that the government develop measures to offer a safety net for gig workers, create formal opportunities for construction laborers, and provide tax rebates for households contributing to social security deposits for their domestic workers.

During a pre-Budget meeting with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman focused on employment and skilling, the industry presented these suggestions to boost employment and enhance skill development.

Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO of CBRE, said that the meeting was on skilling and the government sought suggestions on what can be done on that front.

Industry body Indian Staffing Federation ED Sucheta Dutta said that domestic workers, who are mainly women, do not have future security and financial literacy.

“So, we suggested that if the household provides a social security deposit on behalf of the domestic worker and in return, the household will get a rebate of 12 per cent in income tax,” Dutta said.

Career-tech platform Internshala CEO Sarvesh Agarwal said that broadly the discussions were on how to make India the skill capital of the world.

“There were also several suggestions on the safety net for the gig workers, creating global opportunities for the college students and how to create formal opportunities for the construction workers,” he said.

Gayathri Vasudevan, Chief Impact Officer, Sambhav Foundation, said that the whole discussion happened on what is important for employment and skills.

“How to use NEP (national education policy) better, how can you give standard deductions to middle-class families, so that they can invest in the skill set,” Vasudevan said.

news18.com,Budget 2024: Will Govt Hike Rs 1.5 Lakh Limit Under Section 80C Of Income Tax Act?,"Section 80C Deduction Budget 2024: Each year, numerous taxpayers look forward to the finance minister increasing the Section 80C limit in the Union Budget 2024. The current 80C limit has not been adjusted to match rising incomes and expenses. Consequently, many taxpayers find themselves maxing out the entire 80C limit.



There has been no official announcement about an increase in the Section 80C deduction limit for Budget 2024. The current limit is Rs. 1.5 lakh, which hasn’t changed since 2014. Many taxpayers and financial experts are expecting an increase due to rising inflation.

What Is Section 80C?

Section 80C is a provision under the Income Tax Act of India that allows taxpayers to claim deductions on certain investments and expenses, reducing their taxable income. The maximum deduction limit under Section 80C is Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year.

By investing in or spending on qualifying items under Section 80C, you can lower your taxable income. This can bring you down to a lower tax bracket and save you money on taxes owed.

Section 80C covers many popular investment options like Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS), and Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs). This incentivizes saving and long-term financial planning.

Why Does Section 80C Limit Need to Increase?

There are a couple of main arguments for increasing the Section 80C deduction limit;

Rising cost of living and inflation: The current limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh has been in place since 2014. Inflation has eroded its purchasing power over time. An increase would allow people to invest or spend on necessary things like education and retirement planning without exceeding the deduction limit.

An increase would allow people to invest or spend on necessary things like education and retirement planning without exceeding the deduction limit. Increasing financial goals: The cost of necessities like education and healthcare has risen significantly. The current limit might not be enough to cover these expenses and still invest adequately for retirement. Raising the limit would give taxpayers more flexibility to plan for their future financial needs.

The cost of necessities like education and healthcare has risen significantly. The current limit might not be enough to cover these expenses and still invest adequately for retirement. Raising the limit would give taxpayers more flexibility to plan for their future financial needs. Encourages long-term savings: A higher limit could incentivise people to save more for the future, which would benefit the overall economy.

Supports the middle class: Many middle-class taxpayers rely heavily on Section 80C deductions to reduce their tax burden. An increase would provide them with some tax relief.

Standard Deduction To Be Increased?

The finance ministry is reportedly considering raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime without altering the tax exemption-heavy old regime, as reported by TOI.

In the Budget 2023, the finance minister implemented a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for salaried taxpayers and pensioners under the new tax regime. This standard deduction became the default unless taxpayers chose to opt-out.

Moreover, the rebate under Section 87A was increased for taxable incomes up to Rs 7 lakh under the new tax regime. As a result, individuals with taxable incomes within this threshold became exempt from paying taxes under the new regime.

Tax Limit Expected To Be Increased

The government is reportedly considering measures to potentially reduce personal income tax rates. This move aims to bolster GDP growth by stimulating consumption amid subdued spending levels among the middle class.

The government plans to raise the income threshold for tax liability from the current Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in the forthcoming budget.

This adjustment is intended exclusively for taxpayers under the new regime, aiming to increase disposable income, particularly among lower-income groups.

More Voices For Tax Rebate

India Inc. has also pitched for lowering the income tax burden on the common man.

President of industry body CII Sanjiv Puri put forth eight points for consideration for the finance minister. These include relief in income tax at the lower end of income slabs, streamlining of employment inked incentive schemes like Production Linked Incentive (PLI), and promoting ease of doing business. CII also made recommendations for agriculture and rural development.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/section-80c-deduction-budget-2024-income-tax-act-8945111.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: MSME, Exporters List Demands, Agriculture Pushes For Research Funding","Union Budget 2024 Expectations: Representatives of the MSME industry made many recommendations to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to provide a fillip to the sector. Their issues included constraints faced by the industry in obtaining institutional financing, the RBI’s norms related to NPA classification, and the 45-day payment rule.



Recommendations of the Federation of Indian Micro and Small & Medium Enterprises (FISME) centred on 10 points, including a mechanism for NPA classification, a disaster support mechanism for MSMEs engaged in international trade, and operationalising the use of insurance surety instead of bank guarantees.

General Secretary of Laghu Udyog Bharati Om Prakash Gupta said his association gave eight suggestions to Sitharaman for capacity building in the MSME sector.



Regarding the 45-day payment rule under Section 43 b(h) of the Income Tax Act, Gupta said, “We have always advocated for that” as small players suffer because of delayed payments.

Former vice-president of Bihar Industries Association Sanjay Goenka, who was also present in the meeting, said the discussion also focused on incentives for the MSMEs sector.

Subodh Jindal, President of All India Food Processors’ Association, said a suggestion was made that the depreciation rate in the Income Tax Act for plant and equipment be increased to 25 per cent from the existing 15 per cent.

Murali Krishna, president, Federation of Andhra Pradesh Small and Medium Industries Association, said they sought to exempt MSMEs from tax on certain projects like the Polavaram project and the Amaravati Capital projects.

Higher Investment In Agricultural Research

Farm organisations and experts pitched for higher investment in agricultural research, rationalisation of fertiliser subsidies and infrastructure development to boost the sector’s resilience against climate change.

Stakeholders advocated for a significant hike in the budget allocation for the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) from Rs 9,500 crore to Rs 20,000 crore.

Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture (ICFA) Chairman MJ Khan emphasised the need for “massive investment in agriculture R&D” to drive sector growth and increase farmers’ income.

Experts also called for consolidating all agriculture-related subsidies for transfer through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and increasing the retail price of urea, which has remained unchanged since 2018. The promotion of bio-fertilisers and foliar fertilisers through subsidies was another key demand.

Bharat Krishak Samaj Chairman Ajay Vir Jakhar suggested segregating agriculture funds between education and research.

He pointed out that despite the economic returns on agricultural research being ten times higher than other investments, budget increases in the past two decades have lagged behind inflation rates.

Other notable suggestions included disbanding the MSP committee, and commissioning a new agricultural policy for India and changing the funding ratio for human resource development in centrally sponsored schemes from 60:40 to 90:10, with the central government bearing 90 per cent of the cost for five years.

Experts also suggested increasing the budget allocation for APEDA from Rs 80 crore to Rs 800 crore to boost farm exports, creating district export hubs and launching a National Goat and Sheep Mission.

As the government prepares for the upcoming budget, these recommendations highlight the pressing need for reforms and increased investment in the agricultural sector, particularly in light of climate change challenges and the goal of doubling farmers’ income.

Exporters seek fiscal support measures in their pre-budget meeting with Sitharaman to increase the country’s exports to USD 2 trillion by 2030.

The country’s exports of goods and services have increased to USD 778 billion in 2023-24 from USD 478 billion in 2017-18.

The equalisation scheme will end on June 30 this year. It was started on April 1, 2015, and was initially valid for five years up to March 31, 2020.

On December 8, 2023, the Union Cabinet approved an additional allocation of Rs 2,500 crore for the continuation of the scheme up to June 30.

The scheme helps exporters from identified sectors and all MSME manufacturer exporters to avail of rupee export credit at competitive rates at a time when the global economy is facing headwinds.

Exporters get subsidies under the ‘Interest Equalisation Scheme for pre and post-shipment rupee export credit.

Currently, the scheme provides an interest equalisation benefit at the rate of 2 per cent on pre and post-shipment rupee export credit to merchant and manufacturer exporters of 410 identified tariff lines at 4 digit level and 3 per cent to all MSME manufacturer exporters.

These sectors include handicrafts, leather, certain fabrics, carpets and readymade garments.

During April-May 2024-25, merchandise exports rose by 5.1 per cent to USD 73.12 billion, and imports rose 8.89 per cent to USD 116 billion.

The full budget 2024-25 is expected to be presented in Parliament next month. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is likely to table the union budget for FY25 on July 23 or 24. This will be the full union budget of the Modi 3.0 government.

news18.com,"Budget 2024-25 Likely to Include IREDA, HUDCO Under Section 54EC of IT Act To Facilitate Cheaper Funds","The upcoming Union Budget 2024-25 is likely to introduce provisions that will help secure cheaper funds for two key state-owned companies, IREDA and HUDCO, in alignment with the Modi government’s goals of boosting renewable energy production and affordable housing, according to a moneycontrol report citing a government official.

“The government is mulling including the two PSUs – Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) and Housing and Urban Development Corp. Ltd. (HUDCO) – under Section 54EC of the Income Tax Act. Once these PSUs are included under the Section, the investors buying their bonds will be exempted from capital gains tax,” the MC report cited the official as saying. “The interest rates of such bonds are much lower than in the bond market.”

What is Section 54EC?

Section 54EC of the Income Tax Act provides an exemption from long-term capital gains (LTCG) arising from the sale of immovable assets, such as land and houses, if the proceeds are invested in the PSUs notified under this section. Currently, bonds of state-run companies like Rural Electrification Corp. Ltd (REC) and Power Finance Corp. (PFC) qualify for these exemptions.

LTCG on property sales are taxed at 20 per cent, leading to significant tax liabilities. However, the exemption under Section 54EC can offer considerable tax relief. Although the interest on these PSU bonds is lower, it remains a popular method for investors to save on taxes.

Potential Impact on IREDA and HUDCO

“The government is working on getting the same status for IREDA and HUDCO as is currently available to REC and PFC under this Section of the Income Tax Act. 54EC Bonds have an interest rate of 5.25 percent per annum currently while in the bond market, the interest on the PSU bonds is above 8 percent approximately,” the official said.

If IREDA and HUDCO are included under Section 54EC, it would make their bonds more attractive to investors due to the tax exemption on capital gains. This could lower the borrowing costs for these firms, enabling them to fund renewable energy projects and affordable housing initiatives more efficiently.

Benefits for Investors

Investors seeking to reduce their tax liabilities from long-term capital gains can benefit significantly from investing in bonds issued by IREDA and HUDCO if they are included under Section 54EC. The lower interest rates on these bonds, compared to the higher rates in the general bond market, are offset by the tax savings on capital gains, making them an appealing option for tax-savvy investors.

Under Section 54EC, investments in specified bonds must be made within six months of the sale of immovable property, and the invested amount cannot be redeemed before five years.

“The finance ministry has currently sought some additional information from IREDA and HUDCO on their inclusion in the Section. However, no amendment is needed in the Income Tax Act; it can be simply notified,” the official said, according to the MC report.

In April, the government granted IREDA and HUDCO Navratna status, giving the state-run companies operational autonomy.

This year’s budget holds particular significance as the nation grapples with economic recovery post-pandemic, aims to sustain growth by stabilising inflation, and strives for equitable development.

Budget 2024 Expectations For Salaried Employees

There might be adjustments to income tax slabs under the old regime or an increase in the tax exemption limit for the new regime. This could benefit various income groups. The government might focus on providing tax relief to specific groups, like those with higher spending, through new tax brackets.

Union Budget 2024 Date

The full budget 2024-25 is expected to be presented in Parliament next month on July 23 or 24.

Here’s What Is Expected From Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman;

Reducing Tax Burden

India Inc. pitched for lowering the income tax burden on common people, increasing capital expenditure, and firm steps to contain food inflation in their interaction with Sitharaman ahead of the union budget.

The industry leaders and associations also urged the government to focus more on infrastructure development to maintain the economic growth momentum.

President of industry body CII Sanjiv Puri put forth eight points for consideration for the finance minister.

These include relief in income tax at the lower end of income slabs, streamlining of employment inked incentive schemes like Production Linked Incentive (PLI), and promoting ease of doing business. CII also made recommendations for agriculture and rural development.

Recommendations of Ficci centred around capex drive, innovation and tax simplification.

Another leading industry body Assocham expressed confidence that the Narendra Modi 3.0 government would proceed with a strategic focus on capital expenditure, prioritising investment in infrastructure, education and healthcare in the union budget for 2024-25.

Industry body PHDCCI made recommendations on several matters, including the implementation of the four labour codes across the states to enhance competitiveness of the industry and strengthen university-industry linkages to enhance R&D activity in the country.

8th Pay Commission, OPS

Constitution of the 8th Pay Commission, increase in tax rebate for the salaried class and restoration of the old pension scheme are some of the key demands made by trade union leaders during a pre-budget meeting Sitharaman.

The unions also asked the government to stop the privatisation drive of PSUs, scrap the new pension scheme and restore the old pension scheme (OPS).

Besides, they have sought that all the existing vacancies in the central government departments and PSUs must be filled immediately and the practice of contract and outsourcing should be stopped.

They further said resource mobilisation has to be done by increasing the corporate tax and wealth tax and introducing inheritance tax instead of burdening the common masses with the GST on essential food items and medicine.

Representatives from 12 trade unions including INTUC, AITUC, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC and UTUC attended the meeting.

Some of the demands are that the scope of MGNREGA should be broadened with the provision for a guaranteed 200 days of work for each family. Besides, agriculture and allied sector works should be linked to MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act).

It also demanded providing health benefits to all persons above 60 years of age. It can be made contributory with a token amount of Rs 100 per month and coverage of Rs 5 lakh annually.

news18.com,Lottery-Like Taxation On F&O Trading: Why Is Govt Likely To Impose Higher Tax In Upcoming Budget 2024?,"As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2024-25 next month, reports are floating that the government is planning to impose higher taxes on futures and options (F&O) trading. According to a Financial Express report citing sources, the government is considering two significant steps — reclassifying F&O income from ‘business income’ to ‘speculative income’, and introducing a tax-deducted-at-source (TDS) mechanism.

According to the experts, shifting F&O trading from ‘business income’ to ‘speculative income’ will stop such investors from offsetting losses from other business losses, much like cryptocurrencies. This reclassification would categorise earnings from these derivatives similarly to lottery winnings or cryptocurrency investments, which are currently subject to a flat tax rate of 30 per cent.

TDS will, however, help the government keep track of investors in the F&O market. Such a provision was introduced in the Budget 2023-24 also for cryptocurrencies.

Here’s what is F&O trading and why the government might impose higher taxes on this in the upcoming Budget 2024-25:

What is F&O Trading?

Futures and options (F&O) are financial instruments that allow investors to trade contracts based on the future price of an underlying asset, such as stocks, indices, commodities, or currencies.

Futures Contracts: These are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date. Both parties are obligated to fulfill the contract at expiry unless they close their position beforehand.

Options Contracts: These give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a set price before or at the contract’s expiry.

F&O trading enables investors to hedge against potential market movements, speculate on price changes, and leverage their investments. However, the high leverage involved can lead to substantial losses, making it a high-risk activity for investors.

Why the Government Might Impose Higher Taxes on F&O Trading?

Even as the stock market investments have become popular with the online trading apps, retail investors are more and more falling into high-risk F&O trading. This is leading to huge losses for them, leading to overall dampening of sentiments.

In view of this, the government and regulators have been worried for quite some time about the increased participation of retail investors in the derivatives market.

According to a stock market analyst, “Retail investors usually participate in the futures and options market by getting information on social media platforms, instead of substantive expert advice or research. This leads to huge losses for them as has been witnessed recently.”

Rajarshi Dasgupta, executive director (tax) of AQUILAW, said, “Since the nature of F&O is to transact on a ‘future price of a stock’ at a pre-determined price, this involves more of a speculation like any other speculative transaction i.e., lottery etc. with a pre-determined price set to trade in the future, therefore it would be a bold move to categorise F&O transactions as ‘speculative income’ rather than ‘business income’.”

He added that the government aims to deter excessive speculative activity and promote more cautious trading practices and the retail investors might be encouraged to shift towards more stable investment options like mutual funds, stocks, and bonds, fostering financial stability and wealth creation.

“There will be a hit in the tax perspective as the rate of Income Tax under speculative income will be straight 30% (plus 4% cess) instead of applicable slabs of 5%, 20% or 30% on different slabs of income plus applicability of TDS and profit out of F&O transactions can be offsetted against loss of F&O transactions only resulting in lesser margins in the hands of the dealers,” Dasgupta added.

An investment expert also said the government favors long-term investments over short-term speculation.

“By reclassifying F&O income and introducing TDS, retail investors might be encouraged to shift towards more stable investment options like mutual funds, stocks, and bonds, fostering financial stability and wealth creation,” he added.

He added that the move might also rein in market volatility as leveraged F&O trading often results in high market volatility. Also, excessive speculative trading poses systemic risks to the financial system.

The expert also said the move will also align India’s F&O trading with global F&O trading rules. “In many developed countries, F&O trading income is treated differently from regular business income. For example, the US IRS Section 1256 categorises certain futures and options with distinct tax rules.”",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-25-why-is-govt-likely-to-impose-higher-tax-on-fo-trading-8942801.html

India Inc has pitched for lowering the income tax burden on the common man, increasing capital expenditure, and firm steps to contain food inflation in their nearly two-hour long interaction with finance minister Nirmala Shitharaman ahead of the union budget.

During pre-budget consultation with Sitharaman, the industry leaders and associations also urged the government to focus more on infrastructure development to maintain the economic growth momentum.

The meeting is being attended by the union minister of state for finance, and chief ministers of Goa, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Sikkim.

Deputy chief ministers of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Telangana also attended the consultation meeting.

State finance ministers and other ministers and senior officers from the states and union territories (with legislature) and the union government were also part of the meeting.

In her remarks, FM Sitharaman underlined the government’s support to states through timely tax devolution, Finance Commission grants, and arrears of GST Compensation being provided for providing stimulus to growth.

Regarding the ‘Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment’, Sitharaman mentioned that while most of the loans are untied, a part of it is conditional-linked to citizen-centric reforms by states and sector-specific capital projects and requested the states to avail these loans by fulfilling requisite criteria.

Nirmala Sitharaman is set to become the first finance minister to present seven consecutive Union Budgets, surpassing the record of Morarji Desai, who had presented six budgets in a row.

Earlier, the ministry had invited suggestions on direct and indirect taxes and changes in laws to reduce compliances for the 2024-25 budget from trade and industry associations.

The suggestions could include changes in the duty structure, rates and ideas on broadening of tax base on both direct and indirect taxes giving economic justification for the same, as per the ministry.

For changes in customs and excise duties, the trade and industry would have to supplement and justify their demand with relevant statistical information about the production, prices, and revenue implications of the changes suggested.

The request for correction of inverted duty structure would have to be supported by value addition at each stage of manufacturing of the commodity.

About direct taxes, the ministry said the suggestions could be also on reducing compliances, providing tax certainty and reducing litigations.

It said the government policy in the medium term is to phase out tax incentives, deductions and exemptions while simultaneously rationalising rates of tax.

news18.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Will Housing Sector Get Tax Relief, Industry Status To Real Estate?","The real estate sector in India is a major player for several reasons. As the demand for housing grows, there’s a need for more homes, office spaces, and commercial areas. Real estate development fulfils this need and shapes the physical landscape of our cities.

Given this importance, it’s no wonder the real estate sector keenly awaits the Union Budget every year. With the Union Budget 2024-25 set to be tabled in July, the real estate sector pins renewed hope on the Modi 3.0 regime.



The budget might propose changes in taxation rules for property purchases, deductions for home loans, or infrastructure projects that could impact real estate development.

Union Budget 2024 Expectations: Real Estate

Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Group, said that expectations are high for tax reliefs and other sentiment boosters.

Puri added that the future of the overall industry also depends on unfettered infrastructure deployment to support and improve urban living standards as well as to develop and promote newer areas.

Industry Status

Puri also underlined the long-standing demand of the sector, the ‘industry status’ for the entire housing sector.

Other hopes also revolve around the budget. “Will it take ‘real’ measures to revive the affordable housing segment, which has been on a steady decline after the pandemic?” Puri hoped.

The Indian housing sector remained upbeat in 2024 till date, with housing sales and new launches creating new peaks in the top 7 cities. Sales reached an all-time high at about 4.93 lakh units in FY23-24, while 4.47 lakh units were launched.

However, this momentum must continue in the future too – and the current growth trajectory is skewed towards mid-range and premium housing.

Considering the specific housing needs of India’s lower-income groups, this momentum cannot ride solely on higher-priced homes while affordable housing continues to languish.

As per Anarock Research, the sales share of affordable housing reduced significantly after COVID-19 – from over 26% in 2022 and over 38% in 2019 to approx. 20% in Q1 2024. Due to low demand, this segment’s share of the overall housing supply in the top 7 cities also fell to 18% in Q1 2024, from nearly 40% in 2019.

Many interest stimulants previously extended to buyers and developers of affordable housing have expired in the last two years. This important segment must be revived with high-impact measures like tax breaks – for developers so that they will focus more on affordable housing, and for buyers to improve affordability.

According to Anarock, other measures to reignite affordable housing would be:

Credit-linked subsidy scheme under PMAY

This scheme for EWS/LIG, which expired in 2022, should be revived to incentivise first-time buyers of affordable homes across cities. This will once again invigorate demand in this segment. Subject to criteria specified under government guidelines, CLSS was previously available for housing loans to EWS/LIG buyers in new constructions, and for the addition of rooms, kitchens, toilets etc. to existing dwellings.

Also, under PMAY (Rural), one could avail of this subsidy for all ‘kaccha’ homes being converted into ‘pucca’ ones, provided they fulfil the eligibility criteria.

Re-introduce a 100% Tax Holiday for affordable housing developers

To boost supply and incentivise developers to build more affordable housing, the government can re-introduce the ‘100% Tax Holiday’ benefit they previously enjoyed under section 80-IBA in the Finance Act, 2016. This section provided for major tax relief on the profits earned from developing and building affordable housing projects.

Tweak the definition of affordable housing criteria to widen additional deductions benefits to more buyers

According to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, affordable housing is defined based on property size, price, and buyers’ income. For instance, affordable housing is a house or flat with a carpet area up to 90 sq. m. in non-metropolitan cities and towns, and 60 sq. m. in major cities and valued up to Rs 45 lakh for both. The central bank’s definition, on the other hand, is based on the loans given by banks to people for building a house or buying apartments.

Puri urged that the government must seriously reconsider revising the pricing of homes within the affordable housing budget, taking into consideration city-specific market dynamics. As per the current definition, the size of units at 60 sq. m. carpet area is appropriate. However, prices of units (up to Rs 45 lakh) are not viable across most cities.

For instance, for a city like Mumbai, a Rs 45 lakh budget is meaningless. It would need to be increased to at least Rs 85 lakh.

In other top cities, the budget should be increased to at least Rs 60-65 lakh. With such price revisions, more homes would qualify for the affordable price tag, so more buyers can avail of benefits such as lower GST rates at 1% without ITC, government subsidies, etc.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/union-budget-2024-expectations-housing-sector-tax-relief-real-estate-8939557.html

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Budget, which will be her 7th annual financial statement in a row. It will also be the full budget for the year 2024-25.

However, a final official decision on the date is yet to be taken by the government.

The government will present the Economic Survey on July 3 which is the last day of the special session of parliament, according to the sources.

This will be the first full budget of the Modi Govt 3.0. The monsoon session will take place between July 22 and August 9.

Nirmala Sitharaman on June 12 took office for her second consecutive term as the minister of finance and corporate affairs. On Thursday, the work relating to the preparation of the regular union budget 2024-25 commenced.

After taking charge as the finance minister in the Modi 3.0 government, Sitharaman highlighted the objectives and outlined how the 2024 full budget will include various aspects of the Indian economy.

As Modi 3.0 government gets down to prepare its final Budget for FY 24-25, North Block, which houses the finance ministry, will be in ‘quarantine’ from Thursday until the presentation of the Budget in July.

The finance minister had presented an interim budget on February 1.

Nirmala Sitharaman’s Journey As India’s Finance Minister

Sitharaman, who is credited with carrying forward second-generation reforms in her last term, would be creating a record by presenting the seventh budget in a row and the sixth full budget consecutively.

She has many records to her credit in her political career. She created a record when she was appointed as the first female Raksha Mantri, or Defence Minister, in 2017. Before that, she was an industry and commerce minister.

When her mentor Arun Jaitley (finance minister 2014-19) took ill, Sitharaman was given the charge of the finance portfolio in the newly re-elected Modi government after the 2019 general elections.

She became the first full-time woman finance minister in independent India.

Earlier, Indira Gandhi had held finance as an additional portfolio for a short duration when she was the prime minister of India.

Soon after taking over, the first major reform was a cut in base corporate tax to 22 per cent from 30 per cent to prop up the economy hit by demonetisation and GST implementation.

The following year, India weathered the Covid-19 pandemic with an array of policy measures announced for the poor and continued its tag as the fastest-growing major economy and a ‘bright spot’ in the world economy.

To overcome the hardship during the pandemic, the government announced a special economic package worth Rs 20 lakh crore equivalent to roughly 10 per cent of India’s GDP.

She steered the economy from nearly 24 per cent contraction in the first quarter of FY21, to the fastest-growing world economy.

Despite the fiscal expansion, she continued to follow the path of fiscal consolidation and was successful in bringing down the fiscal deficit to 5.6 per cent of GDP, from the earlier estimate of 5.8 per cent in FY24.

She also set a record by presenting the sixth budget in a row — five annual budgets and one interim — a feat achieved so far only by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai.

After the Modi government came to power in 2014, Arun Jaitley took charge of the finance ministry and presented five budgets in a row from 2014-15 to 2018-19.

In 2017, Jaitley departed from the colonial-era tradition of presenting the budget on the last working day of February to the 1st of the month.

Following the footsteps of her mentor, Sitharaman also did away with the traditional budget briefcase and instead went for a bahi-khata with the National Emblem to carry the speech and other documents.

Born in Madurai on August 18, 1959 to Narayan Sitharaman (who worked in the Railways) and Savitri (a homemaker), Nirmala Sitharaman studied economics at Tiruchirapalli’s Seethalakshmi Ramaswami College.

She then moved to the capital to pursue her Master’s and M.Phil in the subject from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).

But before Sitharaman forayed into politics, she was part of the corporate world in the UK, where she was living with her husband Parakala Prabhakar.

The two had met while studying at JNU, and tied the knot in 1986.

They have a daughter, Parakala Vangmayi.

Sitharaman’s political career began in 2008 when she joined the BJP (she returned to India in the early 1990s), and in two years became the party’s second woman spokesperson after Sushma Swaraj, fielding questions from journalists at the party headquarters and also became a familiar face on television debates.

Before taking the political plunge, she served as a deputy director of the Centre for Public Policy Studies in Hyderabad and also started a school in the city.

From 2003 to 2005, she was also a member of the National Commission for Women.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/union-budget-2024-to-be-presented-on-july-22-economic-survey-on-july-3-8932095.html

Check Details","Nirmala Sitharaman, on Wednesday, took office for her second consecutive term as the minister of finance and corporate affairs. She is set to present the final budget for FY 2025 soon, which will outline the priorities and direction for the Modi 3.0 government’s vision of a Viksit Bharat.

FinMin in ‘Quarantine’ Period

On Thursday, the work relating to the preparation of the regular union budget 2024-25 commenced.

As Modi 3.0 government gets down to prepare its final Budget for FY 24-25, North Block, which houses the finance ministry, will be in ‘quarantine’ from Thursday until the presentation of the Budget in July.



The finance minister had presented an interim budget on February 1.

After taking charge as the finance minister in the Modi 3.0 government, Sitharaman highlighted the objectives and outlined how the 2024 full budget will include various aspects of the Indian economy.

Here’s What Nirmala Sitharaman Said After Taking Charge As The Finance Minister

Sitharaman noted that the government is fully committed to ensuring ‘Ease of Living’ for its citizens and will continue to take further steps in this regard.

Sitharaman stated that the reforms undertaken since 2014 will continue, which will further provide macroeconomic stability and growth for India.

She also highlighted India’s commendable growth story in recent years amidst global challenges and noted that there is an optimistic economic outlook for the coming years.

She urged the departments to advance the NDA government’s development agenda with renewed vigour and ensure responsive policymaking to achieve the Prime Minister’s vision of a ‘Viksit Bharat’.

She also said that the government believes in ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas’ and called for the continued support and cooperation of all stakeholders, including industry leaders, regulators, and the citizens, to ensure a strong and vibrant economy.

Budget 2024 Date

The full and final budget for FY ’25 is likely to be presented to the newly formed 18th Lok Sabha next month.

The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha will begin on June 24 during which new members of the Lower House will take oath and the Speaker will be elected.

President Droupadi Murmu will address a joint sitting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on June 27 and is likely to outline the new government’s roadmap for the next five years. The session will conclude on July 3.

The first three days of the first session will see the newly elected leaders taking oath and electing the Speaker of the House.

Both Houses of Parliament are expected to reconvene in the third week of July for the presentation of the union budget.

Nirmala Sitharaman’s Journey As India’s Finance Minister

Sitharaman, who is credited with carrying forward second-generation reforms in her last term, would be creating a record by presenting the seventh budget in a row and the sixth full budget consecutively.

She has many records to her credit in her political career. She created a record when she was appointed as the first female Raksha Mantri, or Defence Minister, in 2017. Before that, she was an industry and commerce minister.

When her mentor Arun Jaitley (finance minister 2014-19) took ill, Sitharaman was given the charge of the finance portfolio in the newly re-elected Modi government after the 2019 general elections.

She became the first full-time woman finance minister in independent India.

Earlier, Indira Gandhi had held finance as an additional portfolio for a short duration when she was the prime minister of India.

Soon after taking over, the first major reform was a cut in base corporate tax to 22 per cent from 30 per cent to prop up the economy hit by demonetisation and GST implementation.

The following year, India weathered the Covid-19 pandemic with an array of policy measures announced for the poor and continued its tag as the fastest-growing major economy and a ‘bright spot’ in the world economy.

To overcome the hardship during the pandemic, the government announced a special economic package worth Rs 20 lakh crore equivalent to roughly 10 per cent of India’s GDP.

She steered the economy from nearly 24 per cent contraction in the first quarter of FY21, to the fastest-growing world economy.

Despite the fiscal expansion, she continued to follow the path of fiscal consolidation and was successful in bringing down the fiscal deficit to 5.6 per cent of GDP, from the earlier estimate of 5.8 per cent in FY24.

She also set a record by presenting the sixth budget in a row — five annual budgets and one interim — a feat achieved so far only by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai.

After the Modi government came to power in 2014, Arun Jaitley took charge of the finance ministry and presented five budgets in a row from 2014-15 to 2018-19.

In 2017, Jaitley departed from the colonial-era tradition of presenting the budget on the last working day of February to the 1st of the month.

Following the footsteps of her mentor, Sitharaman also did away with the traditional budget briefcase and instead went for a bahi-khata with the National Emblem to carry the speech and other documents.

Born in Madurai on August 18, 1959 to Narayan Sitharaman (who worked in the Railways) and Savitri (a homemaker), Nirmala Sitharaman studied economics at Tiruchirapalli’s Seethalakshmi Ramaswami College.

She then moved to the capital to pursue her Master’s and M.Phil in the subject from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).

But before Sitharaman forayed into politics, she was part of the corporate world in the UK, where she was living with her husband Parakala Prabhakar.

The two had met while studying at JNU, and tied the knot in 1986.

They have a daughter, Parakala Vangmayi.

Sitharaman’s political career began in 2008 when she joined the BJP (she returned to India in the early 1990s), and in two years became the party’s second woman spokesperson after Sushma Swaraj, fielding questions from journalists at the party headquarters and also became a familiar face on television debates.

Before taking the political plunge, she served as a deputy director of the Centre for Public Policy Studies in Hyderabad and also started a school in the city.

From 2003 to 2005, she was also a member of the National Commission for Women.

news18.com,"Budget 2024: FM Nirmala Sitharaman To Present Budget Twice This Year, Here's Why","Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday assumed the charge of union finance minister for her second consecutive term and is set to present the full union budget in July 2024.

All eyes are now on the full budget, where she is expected to outline the vision for the next five years along with key policy announcements. Additionally, she will focus on addressing unemployment by implementing measures to boost manufacturing.

Sitharaman, the first full-time woman finance minister of India, has presented six budgets, including one interim budget. In the interim budget for FY25, she adhered to tradition by sticking to vote-on-account measures only.

Here’s a detailed explanation:

Interim Budget: Early in the year, the finance minister presented an interim budget on February 1. This interim budget is a temporary financial statement meant to keep the government running until the new government takes office.

The interim budget includes expenditures and necessary allocations but usually avoids major policy announcements or changes. This practice ensures continuity of government functions and funding until a new government is formed post-election.

Full Budget: After the general elections, the newly elected government presents a full budget for the financial year. This year, it is expected that the government will present its budget in July. This full budget will detail the new government’s economic policies, expenditures, and revenue plans for the entire fiscal year. It reflects the new administration’s priorities and policy changes.

Why Two Budgets?

This dual-budget practice ensures that the outgoing government does not make long-term commitments or major policy changes right before an election, allowing the incoming government to implement its financial strategies and policies. This approach is standard practice in India during election years to accommodate the transition between the old and new administrations.

A union budget is valid till the end of the financial year on March 31, hence the government has speeding rights only till that date. For the government expenditure occurring between March 1, and a new government being formed, the incumbent government needs permission from the Parliament to incur costs in the interim period. Hence, the interim budget is released.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-to-present-budget-twice-this-year-heres-why-8930019.html
news18.com,Personal Taxation Announcements in Interim Budget 2024: All You Need To Know,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has presented her sixth Union Budget in a row. In this pre-election Budget, though the government refrained from announcing any major populist measure, the finance minister provided some relief to individuals on personal taxation as well as startups. Here are the personal taxation announcements in the Interim Budget 2024-25:

No Changes in Personal Tax Rates

Suresh Surana, founder of RSM India, said, “In line with the past parliamentary practice, the interim budget does not propose any major structural change in the tax rates and continues the same as per last year. Under the new regime, a person having gross income up to Rs 7 lakh shall have NIL tax liability.”

Health & education cess @ 4 per cent is levied on aggregate of tax amount and surcharge amount.

A rebate of Rs 12,500 is available in the case of the old tax regime for a total income up to Rs 5,00,000 and of Rs 25,000 in the case of the new tax regime up to a total income of Rs 7,00,000. Marginal tax relief is available in the case of the new tax regime for income exceeding Rs 7,00,000.

Surcharge on capital gains and dividend taxation unchanged at 15 per cent.

Waiver of Old Trivial Tax Demands

“In the Interim Budget 2024, the Proposal of waiver of old unreconciled trivial tax outstanding is in line with the Government’s vision to improve ease of living and ease of doing business. There are a large number of petty, non-verified, non-reconciled or disputed direct tax demands, many of them dating as far back as the year 1962, which continue to remain on the books, causing undue hardship, administrative difficulties and hindering refunds of subsequent years,” Surana said.

The proposal is to withdraw such outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to financial year 2009-10 and up to Rs. 10,000 for financial years 2010-11 to 2014-15. No specific mention has been made about whether this tax proposal would be applicable for individual or corporate taxpayers. it is expected to overall benefit about 1 crore taxpayers and is extremely welcome. There are no specific proposals in the Finance Bill 2024 in this respect and it is likely that a separate circular will be issued by the CBDT to provide the aforesaid relief.

No Changes in Basic Exemption Limit

“As per the current tax laws, the Basic Exemption Limit (BEL) under old tax regime is Rs 2,50,000, which has remained the same since its last revision in Budget 2014. Even under the new tax regime, the basic exemption limit is Rs 3,00,000,” Surana said.

Considering that the cost of living has increased multi-fold times in the past decade, it was expected that the said basic exemption limit be increased to Rs 3,50,000 under both regimes. Enhancing the said basic exemption limit may benefit a large number of taxpayers and tax filers out of the about 7 crore taxpayers, he added.

Due Date Extension for Filing Belated Tax Return to End of Assessment Year

The existing due date for filing a belated return is December 31 of the relevant assessment year. For instance, the belated return for the financial year 2023-24 can be filed by December 31, 2023. Such filing of a belated return would attract late fees of Rs 5,000 (restricted to Rs 1,000 wherein the total income of the taxpayer does not exceed Rs 5 lakh).

“There are a large number of tax filers who miss the deadline of the belated return due to personal exigencies, delay in getting or collating data. It was expected that belated returns should be permitted up to March 31 but can require a higher fee of Rs 10,000. This would have ensured that while the tax filer is penalised, he does not become a delinquent tax filer,” Suresh Surana said.

“We can still hope that the increase in basic exemption limit and the belated return-related relaxations will be introduced in the Final Budget,” Surana said.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/personal-taxation-announcements-in-interim-budget-2024-all-you-need-to-know-8763054.html

What is an Interim Budget?

Interim Budget, also known as Vote on Account, is a budget presented by the central government for a short period of time ahead of general elections. During an election year, the incumbent government cannot present a full budget, therefore, the Union Finance Minister present an Interim Budget on behalf of the government that covers the Centre’s expenses and revenues for a short period. This budget stands valid till a new government is elected and takes charge.

When Will Full Budget Be Released?

The full Budget will be released after the newly formed government takes over following the Lok Sabha election results. The government will then present a Union Budget which will be its comprehensive financial plan presented annually, outlining the government’s revenue, expenditure, and policy initiatives for the upcoming fiscal year.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/union-budget-2024-nirmala-sitharaman-what-gets-cheaper-and-costlier-interim-budget-check-full-list-here-latest-updates-8761439.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024: Income Tax Slabs, New vs Old Regime Compared For You","A tax slab essentially dictates the amount of tax that an individual or business is required to pay according to their income. In the Interim Budget 2024-25, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed no changes in the tax structure, direct or indirect. This means income tax slabs under the new regime as well as the old regime remain the same as were announced in Union Budget 2023-24. Catch LIVE updates on Interim Budget 2024 here.

Key highlights of the new system include an elevation in the basic exemption threshold and enhanced tax rebates. Taxpayers have the option to choose between the previous tax regime and the updated one.

The modifications were specific to the new tax regime, leaving the old tax regime unchanged. Despite the new tax regime becoming the default option starting from 2023-24, taxpayers retain the flexibility to select the old one if they prefer.

Choosing between the new and old tax regimes can be tricky, especially with the differences in tax slabs. Let’s break down the key points to help you understand:

Old Tax Regime

Slab structure:

5%: From Rs 2.5 lakhs to Rs 5 lakhs

20%: From Rs 5 lakhs to Rs 10 lakhs

30%: Above Rs 10 lakhs

In the old tax regime, there are seven tax slabs, with the liability going from NIL to 30 per cent of the income.

People with an annual income of up to Rs 2.5 lakh are exempt from paying income tax.

Those earning between Rs 2.5 and 5 lakh have to adhere to a tax rate of 5 percent.

For people whose yearly income falls from Rs 5 lakh to 7.5 lakh, the income tax rate is at 10 percent of the total earnings.

Individuals in this bracket have an annual income of Rs 7.5 to 10 lakh. The tax rate for them is 15 percent.

For income ranging from Rs 10 to 12.5 lakh per year, the tax rate is 20 percent.

Those earning between Rs 12.5 and 15 lakh have to follow a tax rate of 25 percent.

For annual income exceeding Rs 15 lakh, the tax rate is 30 percent.

Under the new income tax regime, the number of slabs has been reduced.

Slab structure:

0%: No tax on income up to Rs 3 lakhs

5%: From Rs 3 lakhs to Rs 6 lakhs

10%: From Rs 6 lakhs to Rs 9 lakhs

15%: From Rs 9 lakhs to Rs 12 lakhs

20%: From Rs 12 lakhs to Rs 15 lakhs

30%: Above Rs 15 lakhs

Surcharge: Applies to certain income brackets:

10%: Above Rs 50 lakhs

15%: Above Rs 1 crore

25%: Above Rs 2 crore (reduced from 37% in 2023)

Those who earn up to Rs 3 lakh a month have to pay no income tax.

Annual income ranging from Rs 3 to 6 lakh will invite a tax rate is 5 percent.

However, a tax rebate is applicable for income earned upto Rs 7 lakh, making it tax-exempt as well.

Those earning between Rs 6 lakh and Rs 9 lakh a year have to follow a tax rate of 10 percent.

The tax rate for a yearly income of Rs 9 lakh to Rs 12 lakh has been set at 15 percent.

For the next tax bracket, which covers annual income of Rs 12 lakh to 15 lakh, the tax rate is 20 percent.

The last tax slab covers all those whose yearly income exceeds Rs 15 lakh. They have a tax liability of 30 percent.

New vs Old Tax Regime: Which Tax Regime Is Better?

The best regime for you depends on your income, investments, and deductions. If you have a simple income structure and limited deductions, the new regime might be more beneficial. However, if you have significant investments or claim many deductions, the old regime might save you more tax.

It’s recommended to consult a tax advisor to determine the most suitable regime for your circumstances.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/income-tax-slabs-new-vs-old-tax-regime-budget-2024-8760819.html

news18.com,Budget 2024: What Is Sin Tax? Know How It’s Linked With GST,"Ahead of the presentation of the Union Budget, speculations are high about the government’s move on taxation and the allocation for various sectors. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present Budget 2024 in the Parliament on February 1.

This time the Finance Minister will present an Interim Budget as the Lok Sabha elections are scheduled to be held in April-May. Though major changes to taxation policies are not expected, there are demands from various groups to increase the tax on certain goods to discourage their consumption.

As the past Budgets suggest, the government has been increasing taxes on certain goods like tobacco products, which are considered harmful. The high tax imposed on such products is called ‘Sin Tax’. This year also, the Finance Minister is expected to increase the Sin Tax on harmful goods.

According to a PTI report, a body of medical professionals, economists and public health experts has requested the government to increase excise duty on tobacco products to curb the consumption.

What is Sin Tax?

A sin tax is imposed on products deemed detrimental to public health and society at large. As the name suggests, sin tax is usually a high tax rate imposed on goods and services that are considered harmful for the society. Such taxes are imposed on tobacco, alcohol, cigarettes and gambling, which are considered harmful for society.

A high tax on such products is aimed at discouraging their consumption.

This serves a dual purpose of social welfare and revenue generation.

Elevating market prices of such products due to higher tax rates helps the government to dissuade individuals from indulging in what is perceived as socially undesirable behaviour. Secondly, these taxes place a substantial financial burden on corporations manufacturing such products, contributing to government revenue.

The concept of sin taxes in India was introduced as part of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) in 2017. Known for having some of the highest taxes globally on commodities like cigarettes, whiskey, and pan masala ingredients, India strategically employs sin taxes.

Before the implementation of GST, in 2015 a committee headed by then Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian had recommended a 40 per cent ‘sin tax’ on harmful goods.

Sin taxes, endorsed by renowned economists like Adam Smith, have a historical precedence dating back to 1776. Smith argued that taxes on items such as cigarettes, alcohol, and sugar were justified.

Countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, Sweden and Canada, have embraced sin taxes on a broad spectrum of products and services. These include tobacco and alcohol, as well as lotteries and gambling, generating substantial revenue for governments. In India, currently the sin taxes encompass 52.7 per cent tax on cigarettes, 22.2 per cent for beedis and 63.6 per cent for smokeless tobacco.

Sin taxes, designed to make health-harmful items prohibitively expensive, aim to prompt more responsible consumer choices. As the Finance Minister unveils the interim budget, the nation waits to see how sin taxes will be calibrated to align with public health goals while contributing to the economic landscape.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-what-is-sin-tax-know-how-its-linked-with-gst-8759758.html
news18.com,Budget 2024: What Is 'Bahi Khata'? A Look At How Budget Briefcase Has Evolved,"Over the years, Indian finance ministers have been captured in photographs as they entered parliament carrying a briefcase for the yearly Budget presentation. However, this tradition underwent a significant transformation in 2019, when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman opted for a ‘Bahi Khata,’ bidding farewell to the conventional Budget briefcase.



What Is ‘Bahi Khata’?

In 2019, Finance Minister Sitharaman ushered in a departure from the iconic budget briefcase, opting instead for a “Bahi Khata” or cloth ledger. This decision aimed to break away from the colonial tradition where British finance ministers used to carry a “Gladstone Box” to Parliament, a practice subsequently replaced by bags and briefcases. India embraced a similar transition.

In the lead-up to the 2019 budget presentation, Nirmala Sitharaman was observed with a red Bahi Khata, a traditional ledger of accounts, instead of the customary briefcase. This departure was interpreted as a symbolic renunciation of the colonial legacy, as the briefcase itself was a vestige of British rule in India, modelled after the ‘Gladstone box’ utilised in British budget presentations.

Break away from a colonial practice: The briefcase was seen as a remnant of British rule in India. Using the Bahi Khata, a traditional Indian accounting tool, was seen as a way to embrace the country’s heritage and symbolism.

The briefcase was seen as a remnant of British rule in India. Using the Bahi Khata, a traditional Indian accounting tool, was seen as a way to embrace the country’s heritage and symbolism. Connect with the common people: The Bahi Khata is a familiar symbol for many Indians, particularly those in rural areas and small businesses. Using it was seen as a way to make the budget presentation more relatable and accessible to the average citizen.

The Bahi Khata is a familiar symbol for many Indians, particularly those in rural areas and small businesses. Using it was seen as a way to make the budget presentation more relatable and accessible to the average citizen. Signal a focus on financial inclusion: The Bahi Khata is often used by small businesses and entrepreneurs to track their finances. Using it was seen as a way to signal the government’s commitment to supporting these sectors.

The inaugural union budget of independent India saw its first finance minister, RK Shankmukham Chetty, adhering to the British tradition by transporting documents in a leather portfolio bag. Subsequently, in the following years, various finance ministers opted for distinct briefcases to present the budget.

In contrast, Sitharaman’s choice to utilise the Bahi Khata added an indigenous flair to the budgetary process.

“I thought it was better we move out from the British handhold. And I thought it was good enough to do something on our own. It was easier for me to carry also and very Indian,” Sitharaman said of her decision to use the red silk Bahi Khata.

The customary vessel for budget documents made its second and final appearance in 2020. However, the subsequent year witnessed a departure from this traditional book of accounts in favour of a more contemporary device. In 2021, Nirmala Sitharaman presented the budget in a paperless format, employing a domestically manufactured tablet.

In 2021, 2022, and once more in 2023, she brought the tablet to parliament enclosed in a red pouch reminiscent of the Bahi Khata style. The choice to adopt a tablet was perceived as a stride in support of the government’s Digital India initiative.

Interim Budget 2024

Like the previous three full union budgets, the interim union budget 2024 will also be delivered in paperless form. The interim union budget 2024 is to be presented on February 01, 2024.

Union Budget Mobile App For Budget Documents

All the union budget documents, including the Annual Financial Statement (commonly known as Budget), Demand for Grants (DG), Finance Bill, etc., will be available on the “Union Budget Mobile App” for hassle-free access to budget documents by Members of Parliament and the general public using the simplest form of digital convenience.

news18.com,"Budget 2024: Govt May Set Higher Dividend Target at Rs 70,000 Crore from RBI, Banks and FIs","Having reaped rich dividends from the Reserve Bank in the current financial year, the government will be looking forward to receiving about Rs 70,000 crore from the central bank and the financial institutions (FIs) in the next financial year. In the interim Budget to be unveiled in the Lok Sabha on February 1 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, sources said, the government would peg receipts from dividends from financial institutions at much higher level than Rs 48,000 crore estimated for the current fiscal.

The current financial year estimate has already exceeded the Budget target as RBI paid a dividend of Rs 87,416 crore. With public sector banks and financial institutions posting good quarterly numbers during the current financial year, the dividend payout by them in the coming year would be higher compared to this year.

So, it would be feasible to expect about Rs 70,000 crore as dividend payout from RBI and financial institutions in FY’25, sources said. The government had pegged a 17 per cent higher dividend at Rs 48,000 crore from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), public sector banks and financial institutions in 2023-24.

However, this target was very much surpassed with the transfer of Rs 87,416 crore as surplus to the central government for 2022-23 by the Reserve Bank. During 2023-24, the Reserve Bank transferred a surplus of Rs 87,416.22 crore to the central government which is higher than both the amount transferred last year (Rs 30,307.45 crore) and the budgeted amount under Dividend/Surplus transfer of Reserve Bank of India, Nationalised Banks and Financial Institutions in the Union Budget 2023-24 (Rs 48,000 crore).

In the previous financial year, the government mobilised Rs 40,953 crore from RBI and public sector financial institutions. The higher dividend from banks and financial institutions, apart from higher tax mobilisation, would help achieve a fiscal deficit glide path.

As per the fiscal consolidation roadmap, the government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 4.5 per cent by 2025-26 from an estimated 5.9 per cent of GDP in 2023-24. The government, as per the roadmap, is required to bring down the fiscal deficit to 5.4 per cent in the next financial year beginning April 1, 2024.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-govt-may-set-higher-dividend-target-at-rs-70000-crore-from-rbi-banks-and-fis-8758754.html

The e-commerce sector expects the Budget to focus on digital infrastructure, simplified regulatory framework, skill development for the e-commerce workforce, and support for MSMEs in e-commerce.

Chirag Taneja, founder & CEO of e-commerce enabler Gokwik, urges the government to introduce policies to support digital-first brands aiming to go the omnichannel way. “With technological advancements shaping the e-commerce industry, and the rising role of enablers, the budget should also provide support for the growth of the enablers who are now forming the core backend in the growth of these brands. Overall, I believe budget 2024 will have a holistic approach centered around the growth of the e-commerce industry and take #MakeInIndia on a global scale,” he said.

Vineet Agarwal, managing director of logistics firm Transport Corporation of India Ltd, “As we await the release of Interim Union Budget, the logistics sector stands poised for transformative measures that will fuel our journey to a $5-trillion economy. The forthcoming budget presents a significant opportunity to reinforce our commitment to enhance the ease of doing business.”

He added that in the Budget, continued focus on advocating for a long-term perspective to build physical & digital infrastructure, incentivize multimodal logistics for carbon reduction, and robust skilling initiatives for the 22 million employed in the sector should be the key priorities. “To boost EXIM trade and improve competitiveness, we need to maintain the momentum in investments and digitalization. With this approach, we’ll be able to move fast towards a more resilient and sustainable transport and logistics ecosystem for India.”

Balasubramanian A, vice-president of TeamLease Services, also enlists budget expectations for e-commerce:

Focus on digital infrastructure: Development of a robust national digital infrastructure with affordable internet access in rural areas can increase e-commerce penetration and create up to 5 lakh jobs in digital service delivery and rural e-commerce businesses.

Simplified regulatory framework: Streamlining regulations and promoting transparency in e-commerce platforms can boost investor confidence and attract Rs. 5,000-10,000 crores in investments, potentially creating 2-3 lakh jobs across the e-commerce ecosystem.

Skill development for the e-commerce workforce: Training programs for skills like digital marketing, logistics management, and data analytics can improve efficiency and attract a skilled workforce, potentially creating up to 1 lakh jobs in e-commerce-specific roles.

Government initiatives to help MSMEs promote their products and brands on e-commerce platforms are highly anticipated.

Among other key demands, developing a skilled workforce equipped with cybersecurity knowledge will be essential for safe and secure e-commerce transactions.

These are just some of the key expectations the e-commerce sector has from budget 2024. The upcoming budget will be closely watched to see how the government addresses these areas and shapes the future of e-commerce in India.

Here are some key areas it’s focusing on:

Dr. Somdutta Singh, serial entrepreneur, founder and CEO Assiduus Global Inc, LP Angel Investor, Advisor Govt of India (Core Committee Member of WEP- Niti Aayog) in the e-commerce sector, underlined that embracing technology is crucial for the success of the retail industry. A well-structured budget that aims to enhance business and foster innovation, allocating funds for research and development, along with the integration of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and data analysis, will enable businesses to stay attuned to consumer demands, he said.

Additionally, collaborative efforts involving government bodies, business leaders, and educational institutions can establish a shared working network that supports the inception of new businesses.

Focus On Small Retailers

Singh urged that policymakers should prioritise attention to small retailers in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. These cities have stores with the potential to thrive and compete with more established businesses.

The budget should earmark funds for enhancing skills and adopting technology. By investing in education and skills development, the government can uplift local businesses, enabling them not only to withstand market challenges but also to excel in the demanding retail landscape.

Singh also highlighted the role of Open Network for Digital Commerce.

“I am anticipating that this budget might endorse the implementation of the ‘Open Network for ONDC initiative. This initiative can empower MSMEs to access various e-commerce platforms without encountering entry barriers, benefiting from standardised data and processes,” Singh said.

MSME & E-commerce

Singh also elaborated on how the adoption of e-commerce by MSMEs would facilitate their entry into both domestic and international markets, contributing to economic growth.

“Allocating budgetary resources to enable MSMEs to integrate e-commerce platforms into their business strategies will foster sustainable development. Additionally, ONDC will play a pivotal role in shaping the MSME ecosystem, aiding suppliers in reaching a broader customer base and leveraging diverse logistics for accelerated growth,” Singh urged.

ONDC Expectations From Budget 2024

ONDC in a statement said that this year’s budget will be crucial for the ONDC ecosystem of small startups, MSMEs, and large businesses across the country.

“In the budget, we hope for more simplified operations and compliance in sectors like financial services, facilitating consumers and businesses to derive the maximum possible benefits from an open network like ONDC Network. We are confident that the Government will continue to improve regulatory compliance requirements for emerging business models that depend on DPIs,” ONDC said.

ONDC added that it looks forward to further schemes to accelerate digitisation across the nation including smaller cities, towns and villages.

Technology For Ease

Unicommerce, an e-commerce enablement SaaS platform, said that India’s vibrant retail sector, supported by the expanding e-commerce ecosystem, continues to evolve to meet the needs of its users. Over the years, the government has integrated technology tools to simplify taxation, streamline logistics and promote the use of e-commerce to boost exports.

“We anticipate continued support of the government in facilitating the use of technology to make India’s retail sector future-ready and aligned with growth opportunities,” the statement added.

Startup Ecosystem & E-commerce

Nitya Sharma, founder and CEO, checkout network, Simpl, added that the Indian startup sector has the potential to significantly accelerate commerce in the country, elevate people’s lives and fastrack the journey of India’s internet economy to $1 trillion by 2030.

“This year’s Vote on Account followed by the full year’s union budget should view startups as the sunrise sector, provide easy financing for sellers akin to MSMEs and open up more avenues in the era of unbundling of e-commerce which has started with ONDC. We would expect a greater collaboration between the government and industry in further simplifying the ease of doing business in India and resolving bottlenecks swiftly.”

The Union government is all set to present the interim budget 2024 on February 1.

“We expect capex on infrastructural projects to continue, aiding the automotive sector. The policy push for green mobility should remain a key focus for the government, encouraging faster adoption of electric vehicles,” Mercedes-Benz India MD and CEO Santosh Iyer said.

The luxury car industry has a significant value contribution to the GDP and the segment aspires for a rationalised duty structure and GST on priority, he added.

“Overall, we expect consistency in various policies and no surprises in the upcoming budget,” Iyer stated.

Luxury vehicles currently attract the top GST slab of 28 per cent with an additional cess of 20 per cent on sedans and 22 per cent on SUVs, taking the total tax incidence to up to 50 per cent.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor Deputy Managing Director (Corporate Planning, Finance & Administration and Manufacturing) Swapnesh R Maru said the automaker remains confident that the Government will continue its push towards shifting the economy and transportation sector to a greener future that is less dependent on fossil fuels.

news18.com,Interim Budget 2024 Wishlist: Insurance Industry Expects Higher Deductions for Medical Insurance Premiums,"Written By Ramkumar S & Bijal Khara:

The Union Budget 2023 was a bitter pill to swallow in many ways for the insurance sector, stemming from the fact that increased limit under Sections 80C and 80D, separate deduction for home insurance, relook at GST rates, and tax-free status for pension/annuity were not considered in the Budget. Instead, the Budget saw the introduction of a tax on the maturity amount of life insurance plans when the total early premium surpasses Rs 5 lakh.

It also saw annuity income received from pension plans to be taxed at the marginal tax rate in accordance with the new tax regulation. Further, the googly came in the form of a new personal tax regime, devoid of any deductions under Section 80C, with no tax for taxpayers earning income up to Rs 7,00,000, with the finance minister proposing to make the new regime a default regime. This impacted life insurance companies’ ability to sell policies as many taxpayers bought insurance policies with a view to claiming tax benefits but with no deductions on offer in the new regime making investment insurance a less attractive proposition. This was a surprise. However, the move from the finance ministry could have been owing to the uptake of insurance policies post Covid-19 where the masses felt having life and health insurance was not a choice but a necessity.

Predicting what will happen in the Insurance sector’s budget is like putting money on the ‘Indian Derby’. If you were to ask market participants, they want the finance minister to look at the GST rates, especially term insurance and health insurance plans which attract 18 per cent, while the endowment plans attract 4.5 per cent in the first year and 2.25 per cent from 2nd year onwards. While term insurance plans and health insurance are the leading products, their penetration to rural India is yet minimal. This will probably help the government achieve its ambition for ‘Insurance for all by 2047’.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) is actively working towards the development and implementation of the Indian Risk-Based Capital (Ind-RBC) Framework for the Indian Insurance Industry as part of its developmental agenda. The finance ministry may bring in measures such as new capital requirement, which may be in line with what the RBI has within terms of AT1 Bonds. With the announcement in last year’s budget of the new regime being a default regime with no deductions under Section 80C taking force, the finance minister will look at it again after the loss of lives from various natural calamities and state and central government paying compensation.

Talking about natural calamities, India is also facing challenges owing to earthquakes, floods, tropical cyclones, drought, and wildfires however, the insurance protection against natural catastrophes is meagre.

The year 2023 saw many climate-related catastrophes with widespread damage to lives and property and an anticipation from general insurers for the government to bring in a new slew of measures such as tax sops on the premium paid by the insured, especially with the advent of new infrastructure projects which are being built across the country.

On the health insurance sector, there is an anticipation of increasing deductions for medical insurance premiums with the threat of a new variant of Covid. Also, to make the National Pension Scheme an attractive investment option, the probability of allowing tax exemption over the current 25 per cent limit and also not to tax income from the annuity, which is currently taxable. While the insurance sector will have a wish list, the finance minister will have to strike an equilibrium for the economy’s health and not just one sector.

It serves as a roadmap for the nation’s economic and social well-being, influencing a diverse range of aspects. Amid the mammoth process of creating the Budget, there is a tradition, that is widely acknowledged by the Budget-makers and observed as a sweet gesture and appreciation.



There is an occasion observed by the Ministry of Finance, called the ‘Halwa ceremony’, which marks the commencement of the Budget printing process. It is held in North Block in the national capital in the presence of the Finance Minister and all those who are part of the process.

Budget 2024 Halwa Ceremony

The Halwa ceremony for the interim Union Budget 2024, was held in North Block, on January 25, in the presence of Union Finance & Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Union Minister of State for Finance Bhagwat Kisanrao Karad.

Halwa Ceremony: What It Is And Its Significance?

For Indians, celebration has some form of association with eating something ‘mitha’ (sweet) and this goes true for our annual account statement process as well and the people associated with that crucial task. The Halwa ceremony is a unique pre-budget tradition observed in India, marking the final stage of the Union Budget preparation process.

The Halwa Ceremony is an annual event held a few days before the presentation of the Union Budget. The Finance Minister presides over the ceremony, stirring a large pot of Halwa (a sweet semolina pudding) in the Finance Ministry’s basement.

The sweet is then distributed to Ministry officials and staff involved in the Budget preparation.

Significance of the Halwa Ceremony:

The gesture of appreciation: It’s a sweet thank-you to everyone who contributed tirelessly to the long and meticulous Budget-making process.

Halwa Ceremony Process

Every year, the government follows this annual tradition of organising a Halwa ceremony, days before the Budget is presented in the Parliament. As part of the ritual, Halwa is prepared in a traditional ‘kadhai’ (large cauldron) and served to the entire staff involved in the Budget making exercise for the country.

The Finance Minister stirs the dessert and serves it to colleagues. The dish is distributed to every staff member and the ceremony recognises and lauds the efforts of those who have been a part of the process.

Budget 2024: What is ‘lock-in’ in the Budget making process?

To maintain the secrecy of the Budget, there is a “lock-in” of the officials involved in making the Budget. Budget Press, situated inside North Block, houses all officials in the period leading up to the presentation of the Union Budget. These officers and staff come in contact with their near and dear ones only after the Budget is presented by the Union Finance Minister in Parliament.

The Halwa Ceremony is more than just a sweet treat; it’s a significant ritual marking the culmination of months of hard work and ushering in a crucial phase of Budget preparation, all while upholding the utmost secrecy.

news18.com,Budget 2024: Will the New Central KYC be the Game-Changer for India’s Financial Landscape?,"Ahead of the Union Budget 2024, the government is deliberating upon a single Know Your Customer (KYC) for all financial services across the board. The aim is to reduce duplication of paperwork and the burden of costs on financial institutions and other businesses and boost ease of doing business as a result.

Business activity is often subject to regulatory frameworks which are meant to safeguard economies, and investors on an individual level. If regulations are essential to overall safety, the streamlining of procedures and records aligned with the technological advancement of the day is crucial for the purpose of achieving a robust investment and credit-friendly environment. This is where CKYC comes in.

A centralised, fool-proof KYC could propel India’s investment climate to higher levels, building trust, enabling lenders and unleashing the impact of the growing class of investors in India.

All Set for Revamped CKYC?

The finance ministry led by minister Nirmala Sitharaman has called for a crucial high-level meeting on January 24 including top officials from the ministry, regulatory bodies and heads of private and public sector banks.

The meeting will be attended by officials from various regulatory bodies, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). Additionally, representatives from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) will also be present at the high-stakes meeting.

The discussions will reportedly revolve around Central KYC of CKYC, particularly the efficient utilisation of the Central Know Your Customer Registry (CKYCR) which has been termed as crucial to facilitate ease-of-doing business and ensure complete compliance with customer due diligence requirements.

What is CKYC?

CKYC enables customers and investors to complete KYC only once before interacting with different entities in the financial services sector. It aims to achieve greater ease of doing business by allowing investors greater agility across a host of financial institutions, and streamlining of databases and to avoid duplication of KYC done through multiple organisations.

This will significantly reduce the burden of compliance and the added cost of repeating KYC procedures on financial institutions. Further, it will create a streamlined database which will provide a clearer picture for regulatory bodies and law and order agencies.

Under CKYC, individuals can submit their KYC documents, such as identity and address proof, just once and get a unique 14-digit KYC number allocated by Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction & Security Interest of India (CERSAI), a statutory body that operates under the aegis of the RBI.

While the traditional KYC process includes the requirement of physical presence and physical documents and the subsequent eKYC implementation, seeking an easier electronic alternative of KYC, entails an online process seeking only digital documents— the CKYC is conceptually a one-time KYC seeking digital documents and biometric verification.

‘High-Risk’ Hiccup

By March 31, 2023, the CKYC Record Registry hosted more than 70 crore KYC records, and the growing number of KYC records downloaded by reporting entities from CKYCRR signifies the benefit and ease this repository has provided to the reporting entities and their customers.

Central KYC was enacted in 2016, but in 2023, the RBI deemed these registrations as “High Risk,” sending shockwaves across the industry and slowing down the pace at which customers were onboarded through this process.

The high-risk tag stemmed from doubts about the quality of the data and its vulnerability to fraud. While CKYC was a noble idea aimed at reducing the hassle and costs for financial institutions and other businesses that must verify the KYC status of their customers, the high risk tag indicates that it was short of being fool-proof and may require a greater component of face match and biometric verification.

However, the government has not given up on its agenda to streamline KYC norms to boost business prospects for India’s fast-growing financial market. The government anticipates that upon complete implementation, CKYC will offer investors advantages such as cost optimisation, inter-usability of KYC records across the financial sector, and the convenience of uploading documents in a centralised location.

If CKYC is implemented with a foolproof mechanism, the government will unleash its full potential, granting enviable conditions for both businesses and customers and enhancing the country’s ease of doing business rankings, specifically in the parameters of ‘getting credit,’ ‘protecting investors’ and ‘trading across borders’.

Since, there are other KYC norms in use whose registries may become redundant in the case of CKYC implementation, the government may seek to reconcile these issues ahead of the Budget 2024.

Here’s how KYC works

Introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2002, KYC has managed to curb money laundering and fraud by ensuring that banks have enough information about their customers to understand their financial activities and assess potential risks. Back then however, the process entailed in-person verification which is time and resource-consuming and not accessible to all.

Subsequently, the introduction of Aadhaar helped build better conditions for KYC. According to the Finance Minister Sitharaman, the cost of customer acquisition through KYC has fallen from Rs 500 to 700 to only Rs 3 per person owing to the leveraging of the Aadhaar database.

KYC allows organisations to gather vital customer information, including identity, address, occupation, and income source, helping financial institutions assess risk profiles and offer suitable services.

All financial institutions in India must adhere to KYC procedures outlined by the RBI, ensuring a standardized approach for industry-wide integrity.

KYC is essential for both new customer accounts and maintaining existing ones, ensuring regular verification and updating of customer details.

Financial institutions are responsible for periodically updating KYC records to keep information current and accurate, aiding in the identification of changes in customer behavior or suspicious activities.

Why KYC is Essential

KYC compliance is vital for building trust, transparency, and collaboration, while minimising risks. KYC helps establish confidence in real-time cross border payments, and large transactions in general.

In the ever-expanding global economy and the emergence of new technologies, financial institutions face increased susceptibility to illicit activities. Hence, in this day and age of increased use of financial services, KYC is essential.

KYC procedures play a crucial role in detecting fraudulent activities within customer accounts, allowing financial institutions to identify unusual patterns or transactions indicating fraud or identity theft. Another key goal of KYC is to prevent money laundering by verifying customer identity and understanding their financial activities, aiding in the detection and deterrence of illegal activities.

The implementation of Know Your Customer (KYC) standards acts as a protective measure, involving steps like confirming customer identity, understanding their activities, validating the legitimacy of funds, and assessing associated money laundering risks.

The cornerstone of a successful compliance and risk management program lies in robust Know Your Customer (KYC) processes.

news18.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations Real Estate: Rise Of Home Loan Cap, Interest Subsidy & ITC","Budget 2024 Expectations: With Budget 2024 coming up soon, the Indian real estate sector is buzzing with expectations. It’s important to note that February’s budget will likely be an interim budget due to upcoming elections. While major policy changes might be limited, they can still set the tone for the full budget presented by the next government.



Remember, these are just some of the expectations. The actual measures announced in the budget could be different. Regardless, the real estate sector remains hopeful for favourable policies that stimulate growth and benefit both developers and homebuyers.

Here’s a breakdown of some key expectations:

Home Loan Cap From Rs 2 lakhs To Rs 5 lakhs

Venkatesh Gopalakrishnan, director group promoter’s office, MD & CEO, Shapoorji Pallonji Real Estate (SPRE) said as we approach 2024, the real estate sector is at a crucial point, anticipating opportunities beyond conventional boundaries. With signs of pre-pandemic stability, the industry is poised for sustained growth.

“While acknowledging the government’s efforts, we propose targeted measures in the upcoming Union Budget to unlock the sector’s full potential. We urge the government to consider our primary request, which is a significant increase in the home loan cap from Rs 2 lakhs to Rs 5 lakhs annually. This would not only incentivise homebuyers but also boost industry revenue,” Gopalakrishnan added.

Capital Gains Tax

Gopalakrishnan also advocated for a reduction in long-term capital gains tax, waiving notional rent on second properties, and aligning the income tax rate with corporate rates at around 25 per cent.

“To revive the sector, the government should focus on affordable housing. We propose to reduce GST rates and interest subventions for affordable housing. Single window clearance for the sector has been pending for a long time. We hope to see it granted in this year’s budget,” Gopalakrishnan urged.

Industry Status

Gopalakrishnan also demanded the industry-wide call for granting “industry status” to the residential sector, aligning with the government’s vision of “housing for all.”

Section 80C Limit

Gopalakrishnan also highlighted supportive measures, including NAREDCO’s appeal for a Rs 50,000 crore fund, which will also align with the government’s vision of “housing for all” and could significantly fortify the sector’s trajectory.

“The budget is a chance to redefine affordability as the diverse locations demand different price caps instead of uniformity. Recognising changing investment dynamics, we suggest expanding Section 80C limits for millennials and Gen-Z homebuyers,” Gopalakrishnan said.

GST, ITC & CLSS Scheme

Pradeep Aggarwal, founder and chairman, Signature Global (India), also emphasised the long-overdue grant of industry status to the real estate sector.

“Urging the extension of Infrastructure status to affordable housing, we advocate for a solution where the sector receives input tax credit benefits and reduced GST rates on construction materials reduced to single digits,” Aggarwal urged.

Aggarwal also underlined the need for the government to institute a Single Window Clearance system for expeditious project execution. Furthermore,he added that the government should relaunch the CLSS scheme, expanding affordable housing criteria to Rs 75 lakhs and increasing the carpet area to 90 square metres.

“These strategic measures are envisioned to fortify the real estate sector and contribute significantly to the nation’s economic resurgence.”

Artificial Intelligence Adoption

Sanjeev Bhandari, founder & CEO, AirBrick Infra, said, “We look forward to policies that propel digital transformation and artificial intelligence adoption. Anticipating increased budgetary allocations for skilling programs, the industry expects a focus on developing a robust talent pool. Additionally, incentives for businesses investing in AI research and development, coupled with measures to ensure ethical AI practices, are eagerly awaited. A balanced approach to regulation, fostering innovation while addressing potential risks, is paramount.”

“The industry hopes the budget will reflect a commitment to positioning the nation as a global leader in the responsible and beneficial application of transformative technologies.”

Energy Efficient Sector

Sourabh Bansal, co-founder & MD, Magicrete, said, “Our expectations align with the urgent need for sustainability and energy efficiency. The construction sector’s impact on global carbon emissions underscores the necessity for transformative measures. We advocate for the introduction of financial incentives and subsidies, such as reduced GST rates, tax credits, or grants, to encourage the production and utilisation of green building materials. The government’s commitment to reducing emissions intensity aligns with our plea for substantial investments in research and development for sustainable technologies in construction.”

news18.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations Healthcare: 'GST Relief, More Allocation & Infrastructure In Small Towns'","Budget 2024 Expectations: The Indian healthcare sector has high hopes for the upcoming Union Budget 2024-25, with stakeholders eager to see increased investment and policy changes that can address critical challenges and improve accessibility and affordability of care.



Here are some key areas where budget expectations are focused:

Healthcare Beyond Metros

Jasdeep Singh, Group CEO, Care Hospitals Group, said “In the upcoming 2024 budget, the government could consider enhancing the budget for the healthcare industry. The increased budget allocations can improve accessibility and affordability to people not just in tier I cities, but also in tier II and tier III cities.”

Singh highlighted that simplifying and making fairer taxes, specifically reforming GST, can contribute to this goal. The government could also consider a framework to focus on healthcare insurance, medical supplies and equipment, telemedicine, and medical tourism sectors of the healthcare industry, he added.

Healthcare Infrastructure

Singh said there is a critical need for focused attention on hospital infrastructure. While hospitals delivered essential and high-quality treatment during the pandemic, the prevailing circumstances underscored the inadequacies in facilities, particularly a glaring shortage of beds and treatment options, especially in non-metro cities.

“Consequently, the government must prioritise enhancing infrastructure, especially in non-metro areas, ensuring that individuals can readily access healthcare when required. This initiative will not only benefit local communities but also contribute to the overall improvement of healthcare services on a global scale,” Singh urged.

Training Healthcare Workers

Singh urged for allocation of funds for training and development programs for healthcare providers, such as doctors and nurses, is essential. This will enhance their skills and contribute to better healthcare outcomes.

“2024 could be a promising year for the healthcare sector. We are hoping the government is going to consider the healthcare industry as a focus in this year’s union budget,” Singh added.

Pritika Singh, CEO, Prayag Hospitals Group, also highlighted the focus on enhancing healthcare infrastructure, along with allocating resources for advanced medical technologies and fostering research and development.

She added that the government’s support in the form of tax incentives for healthcare investments, streamlined policies to encourage public-private partnerships, and increased budgetary allocation for medical education and training would greatly contribute to elevating the overall healthcare ecosystem.

Reforms In Health Insurance

Pritika Singh also pointed out the need to prioritise health insurance reforms and incentivising preventive healthcare measures, which can lead to a healthier nation and reduce the burden on the healthcare system.

“In these unprecedented times, a collaborative effort between the government and private healthcare entities is essential. We hope the budget reflects a forward-looking approach, aligning with the industry’s expectations, and ultimately resulting in a robust healthcare framework for the nation,” she urged.

Patient Education & Awareness

Naresh Ahuja, founder and CEO at SMS Scientific, felt that patient education

remains a significantly overlooked domain, yet it holds pivotal importance in ensuring accurate information dissemination, especially in the current era dominated by the internet and social media.

“The prevalence of misinformation circulating online poses a serious challenge,

misleading both patients and caregivers,” Ahuja added.

Ahuja highlighted that there is a pressing need to promote patient education and awareness, supported by the development and implementation of tools and resources facilitating seamless and precise communication between healthcare providers and patients during consultations.

“Recognising the gravity of this issue, we express our hope that the finance minister considers allocating special attention to this critical aspect,” Ahuja urged.

Demand Of GST Relief

Ahuja also advocated for GST relief on products and tools designed to enhance doctor-patient communication, and proposed providing incentives to pharmaceutical companies utilising these products and tools as part of their services to the medical industry.

“Such measures will not only foster improved patient understanding but also contribute to the overall efficiency of the healthcare system,” Ahuja added.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-expectations-healthcare-gst-relief-more-allocation-infrastructure-in-small-towns-8750231.html
news18.com,"Budget 2024 Wishlist: Gem & Jewellery Sector Urges For Duty Cuts On Gold, Cut & Polished Diamonds","Budget 2024 Expectations: In anticipation of the Union Budget, the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) is urging the government to decrease the import duty on gold and cut and polished diamonds. This move is aimed at enhancing the global competitiveness of the sector.

The gem and jewellery sector in India relies on imported raw materials such as gold, diamonds, silver, and coloured gemstones.

According to a report by news agency PTI, the GJEPC is advocating for a decrease in import duty on precious metals to 4 percent, down from the existing 15 percent. Additionally, it is urging a reduction in customs duty on cut and polished diamonds to 2.5 percent from the current 5 percent.



The leading industry association indicated that the imposition of elevated import duties on cut and polished gemstones could result in decreased exports and fewer job opportunities within the jewellery sector. This, in turn, would make survival challenging, as it would compromise the competitive edge against other countries such as China and Thailand.

It called on the government to reinstate the Diamond Imprest Licence and reduce import duties.

This will provide a level playing field for Indian MSME diamond exporters with that of their larger peers, stop the flight of investment of Indian diamantaires to diamond mining destinations and give more employment in terms of diamond assorters and processing of semi-finished diamonds in the factories, the exporter’s body added.

The Council has appealed to the government to address its longstanding request for allowing the sale of rough diamonds in Special Notified Zones (SNZs) through the Safe Harbour Rule. Additionally, it has recommended expanding the scope of entities authorized to operate within SNZs. Presently, SNZs only facilitate viewing sessions conducted by mining countries.

The council further advocated for granting permission for Special Notified Zones (SNZs) to operate as Free Trade Warehousing Zones (FTWZs) during periods of inactivity by Foreign Mining Companies and entities. This proposal aims to ensure the optimal utilisation of the facilities established and maintain the financial viability of the centers.

To further extend and expand the scope of SNZs, the GJEPC requested the government to also allow globally recognised diamond broking and trading houses to operate from such SNZs.

Such trading houses are the focal point for the sale of diamonds by smaller miners, which cumulatively comprise close to 35 per cent of the global mining produce, the apex industry body added.

Further, to maximise benefits from the India-UAE CEPA, the Council also recommended the introduction of a mechanism like “Rates and Taxes Refund” through EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) system similar to GST refund and the rate of refund should be aligned with the rates and taxes (that is Import Duty and GST) prevailing as on the day of export.

“Gem and jewellery exports have been facing a challenging time on account of the economic downturn in key export markets, geo-political concerns, supply and demand side constraints in the global diamond industry, and unavailability of precious metal in the country among others. Our pre-budget proposals will facilitate easy access to raw materials for the industry, especially for MSMEs,” GJEPC chairman Vipul Shah told PTI.

He said, by introducing a ‘safe harbour rule’ for the sale of rough diamonds in SNZs, India can become a trading hub like Dubai and Belgium and diamond manufacturers will not have to travel abroad to get access to these trading hubs.

He said the introduction of a Diamond Imprest License to 2.5 per cent will help cope with the impact of beneficiation policies undertaken in several natural diamond mining countries.

“This will give India a level playing field with competing countries like China, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. We are hopeful that with the additional support of the government in terms of reduction in import duty of precious metals and MOOWAR scheme for the gem and jewellery industry, the exports of gold jewellery will increase substantially in these challenging times,” Shah added.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-wishlist-gem-jewellery-sector-urges-for-duty-cuts-on-gold-cut-polished-diamonds-8748651.html
news18.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: Will EV Sector Get More FAME On February 1? Know What Industry Wants,"Budget 2024 Expectations: The Indian EV sector is eagerly awaiting the upcoming Union Budget 2024, hoping for a slew of measures that will accelerate its growth. India has the potential to become a global hub for EV manufacturing. The industry is expecting tax breaks, subsidies, and other incentives to attract investments in EV manufacturing facilities.



The government has been supportive of the EV sector in recent years, and it is expected that the upcoming budget will continue to provide a positive impetus for its growth. Here are some of the key expectations from the industry:

Pratik Kamdar, co-founder & CEO, Neuron Energy, said as the Union Budget 2024 approaches, the industry anticipates pivotal measures to propel it forward.

“We strongly support a positive change in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rules, especially urging a lower tax rate for EVs and their parts. This adjustment won’t just make EVs more affordable but will also encourage more people to embrace electric transportation, aligning with our country’s goal of sustainable and eco-friendly travel,” Kamdar urged.

FAME

Kamdar is hoping that the government extends and strengthens the support for the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME II) scheme. Keeping this scheme going is crucial for the continued growth of the EV ecosystem.

“In addition, we look forward to insights on the much-anticipated FAME III scheme. A well-defined roadmap in this regard would provide manufacturers with clarity, enabling strategic planning and fostering investor confidence. The seamless transition from FAME II to FAME III is essential for the industry’s progressive trajectory, and we hope the budget will provide a comprehensive vision for the future of electric mobility. With the rising pollution levels among the major cities in India, we need faster adoption and promotion of EVs as a sustainable alternative,” Kamdar added.

PLI

Hari Kiran, co-founder and COO, eBikeGo, felt that as the 2024 Budgеt approaches, the automotivе industry еagеrly awaits insights into thе GST landscapе, particularly for еntry-lеvеl two-whееlеrs.

Kiran highlighted that anticipation surrounds updatеs on thе potential FAME 3 scheme, PLI sops, and rеvisions to GST for two-whееlеrs.

“We hope for a continuation of green mobility emphasis, building on the government’s understanding of thе symbiotic relationship bеtwееn environmental sustainability and economic growth,” Kiran said.

Customs Duty On EV Parts

Thе rеduction in customs duty on EV parts in thе previous budgеt spurrеd local manufacturing, and similar amendments are еxpеctеd in thе 2024 budgеt. Calls for a uniform 5% GST on all EV sparе parts, alignеd with thе 5% GST on vеhiclеs, rеsonatе within thе industry, as we aim for a morе еquitablе tax structurе, Kiran noted.

Looking beyond financial allocations, we hope thе budgеt unveils a comprеhеnsivе policy framework for EVs, addressing licеnsing, safety standards, and insurancе norms tailorеd for еlеctric vеhiclеs. To foster cost rеduction, a focus on localising battеry manufacturing is crucial, with incеntivеs for battеry manufacturing units and a robust supply chain for EV componеnts.

EV Infrastructure & Clean Energy

Akshit Bansal, founder & CEO, Statiq, the EV Charging Station Network, said the pre-budget expectations for 2024 are grounded in the urgent need for transformative reforms in the auto sector, specifically geared towards nurturing a green and clean energy segment.

“With a staunch commitment to combat pollution and address climate change, we anticipate the government to align its policies with the net-zero goal and sustainable development. In particular, the implementation of PLI schemes tailored for EV charging companies is of utmost importance,” Bansal highlighted.

The growth of EV infrastructure plays a pivotal role in driving widespread EV adoption in India, and financial incentives will undoubtedly accelerate the expansion of the charging network.

“Looking forward to tax reformation that not only supports our industry but also encourages consumers to embrace electric vehicles. Circular economy measures should also find a prominent place in the budget, promoting recycling, waste reduction, and the use of eco-friendly materials in manufacturing,” Bansal added.",Left,,https://www.news18.com/business/budget-2024-expectations-will-ev-sector-get-more-fame-on-february-1-know-what-industry-wants-8744939.html
news18.com,Budget 2024: Meet Nirmala Sitharaman's Key Team in Shaping Interim Budget This Year,"Interim Budget 2024: Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting the Interim Budget 2024-25 ahead of the Lok Sabha elections scheduled later this year. The Union Budget is prepared annually by the Department of Economic Affairs, which operates under the Union Ministry of Finance.

Drafting The Union Budget

The exercise of drafting the Union Budget is spearheaded by the top bureaucrats in the PMO and the Finance Ministry. The exercise is a robust and complicated one. To begin with, North Block, the structure on New Delhi’s Raisina Hill that houses the Finance Ministry, goes into lockdown mode marked by the ceremonial ‘halwa’ ceremony. In a longstanding tradition, this ceremony marks the commencement of the Union Budget’s compilation and printing. It signifies the final stages of preparation of the Union Budget.

During the printing of the Union Budget, officials park themselves in the office with limited communication even with their families, given that it is one of India’s most guarded documents. In fact, the Finance Ministry has a floor for the nights that are spent in the North Block by the key members of the team involved in the printing the financial document. Actually, the budget-making exercise typically begins six months before the document is presented, preceded by meetings with industry leads, social sector analysts, economists and so on.

The annual Budget statement serves as a fundamental financial blueprint established by the governing administration, outlining projected government earnings and expenses for the forthcoming fiscal year.

But this year, an Interim Budget will be presented by the ruling government in Parliament. The current ruling government tables the Interim Budget when there is insufficient time to present a complete budget or when elections are due in the same year. Typically, it is the incoming government that is responsible for formulating the full budget.

Key Members

The key members involved in budget making are Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra, Ajay Seth, Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, Vivek Joshi, Secretary of the Department of Financial Services, TV Somanathan, Finance Secretary, V Anantha Nageswaran, Chief Economic Advisor, and FM Nirmala Sitharaman.

Besides them, P K Mishra, Principal Secretary to the PM and four additional secretaries to the PM including Arvind Shrivastava, Punya Salila Srivastava, Hari Ranjan Rao and Atish Chandra are also closely involved in the Budget preparations, a report in Moneycontrol said.

FM Sitharaman will be presenting her sixth straight Budget for fiscal year 2024–25, but as mentioned above the full Budget will be tabled after the Lok Sabha Elections scheduled for May 2024.

Finance Secretary Somanathan oversees the expenditure department and provides guidance to the Finance Minister on financial allocation. He has played a crucial role in implementing significant government initiatives, such as Atmanirbhar Bharat.

Finance Secretary TV Somanathan, a Tamil Nadu cadre officer, is the point-person for the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) in the Finance Ministry and has played a key role in crafting the schemes to contain the fallout of the pandemic. He is also instrumental in driving the capital expenditure spend across ministries, which is to the tune of Rs 10 lakh crore for FY24. Somanathan served as an Additional Secretary at the PMO before joining the Finance Ministry.

PK Mishra oversees all important policy matters of the government. A cabinet-ranking bureaucrat, he is the PM’s eyes and ears across ministries.

Arvind Shrivastava, the Finance and Economy officer in the PMO, is a 1994-batch IAS officer from the Karnataka cadre. The ministries of finance and corporate affairs and NITI Aayog come under his purview. He joined the PMO from the Finance Ministry where he was Joint Secretary.

Punya Salila Srivastava was appointed as Additional Secretary in the Home Ministry from November 2020 to October 2021, after which she moved to the PMO. A 1993-batch IAS officer of the AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory) cadre, she was part of the team which briefed the media daily during the Covid pandemic. She handles the social and welfare verticals.

Hari Ranjan Rao is a 1994-batch IAS officer of the MP cadre and looks at technology and governance verticals at the PMO. Rao is the Former Secretary to the former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj Singh Chouhan and worked as Managing Director of the MP Tourism Board. Before joining the PMO, Rao was posted in the Department of Telecommunications.

Atish Chandra is a 1994-batch Bihar-cadre IAS officer and oversees the rural development vertical. Before joining the PMO, Chandra was posted as Food Corporation of India CMD.

news18.com,"Budget 2024: Hike Tax On Tobacco Products, Urges Doctors & Public Health Groups","Public health groups along with doctors and economists have urged the government to increase excise duty on all tobacco products in the Union Budget 2024-25 to generate additional revenue. In their appeals to the Finance Ministry, they asked for an increase in health taxes on cigarettes, bidis and smokeless tobacco.



Health taxes are excise taxes imposed on products such as tobacco that have a clear negative public health impact. According to these experts, among the several public policy tools to regulate the consumption of tobacco, increasing the excise tax is considered to be one of the most cost-effective, based on a substantial body of research from around the world.

Health taxes, also known as sin tax, are often used by many countries to achieve this. According to a recent study, cigarettes, bidis and smokeless tobacco have become increasingly affordable over the past 10 years.

Recently, there has been a minor increase in National Calamity Contingent Duties (NCCD) on cigarettes, but apart from that, there has not been any major increase in tobacco taxes since the introduction of GST in July 2017, said Dr Rijo John, health economist and adjunct professor, Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kochi.

Adding the current GST rate, compensation cess, NCCD, and Central Excise, the total tax burden (taxes as a percentage of final tax inclusive retail price) is only about 49.3 per cent for cigarettes, 22 per cent for bidis and 63 per cent for smokeless tobacco, he said.

WHO recommends a tax burden of at least 75 per cent of retail price for all tobacco products. The existing tax burden on all tobacco products is far lower than this.

“Given that more than six years have passed since the implementation of the GST, and there has been no substantial tax hike on tobacco products during this period, it is crucial for the Union government to consider increasing taxes on tobacco beyond minor increments in NCCD, which make up less than 10 per cent of the overall taxes imposed on tobacco.

“When the government refrains from raising taxes on tobacco, the tobacco companies independently elevate prices, thereby boosting their profits. Consequently, the augmented revenue that the government could have collected is redirected toward industry profits,” Dr John said.

According to the experts, increasing excise on all tobacco products can be a very effective policy measure to address the immediate need to raise revenue by the central government. It will be a winning proposition for generating revenue and reducing tobacco use and related diseases.

“Tobacco use which is a slow-moving pandemic itself claims the lives of 13 lakh Indians each year. It is critical than ever before to keep tobacco products out of the hands of vulnerable populations like youth and the underprivileged sections of society. Nearly 50 per cent of all cancers in India are due to tobacco. It is in the interest of the users as well as for the country to increase taxes on all tobacco products. This will reduce their affordability and consumption,” said Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, Head Neck Cancer Surgeon, Tata Memorial Hospital.

The Parliament Standing Committee on Health recently submitted a pertinent and comprehensive report on Cancer Care Plan and Management in which it undertook a detailed study of the causes of Cancer in India and noted with concern that in India, “the highest number of lives lost is due to oral cancer caused by tobacco, followed by cancer of the lungs, oesophagus and stomach.”

It also noted that tobacco use is one of the most prominent risk factors associated with cancer. In view of these alarming observations, the Committee has noted that India has one of the lowest prices for tobacco products and there is a need to increase taxes on tobacco products. The Committee recommended the government to raise taxes on tobacco and utilize the additional revenue gained for cancer prevention and awareness.

India has the second largest number (268 million) of tobacco users in the world and of these 13 lakhs die every year from tobacco-related diseases, experts said.
