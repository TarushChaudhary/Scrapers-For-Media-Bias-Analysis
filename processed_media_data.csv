financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Impact of proposals and tax changes on propensity to save,"By Dr Sarika Rachuri and Dr Badri Narayanan

Every year, the finance minister presents a Union budget, which is not only a fiscal arithmetic but also a powerful and potent tool to allocate scarce resources to different sectors. It influences the different vectors of aggregate demand: Consumption, Investment, Government Expenditure, and Net Exports. The implicit and underpinning outcome of the union budget which is often not articulated is a default choice architecture of these public policies, that it creates for the public. All public policies provide a nudge in banning undesirable outcomes, (huge tax incidence on cigarettes) while promoting desirable ones (incentivising savings), channelising investments for underdeveloped regions, or even to promote balanced growth. One of the central themes of public finance and union budget is its ability to save and invest. Taxation plays a defining role in people’s ability and inclination to save and invest.

Tax Provisions

From time to time various tax provisions first enunciated in the budget, have provided tax rebates and exemption to the public. Section 88 allowed individuals to claim tax under PPF, NSC, life insurance premiums, Infrastructure bonds, and the like. This was supplemented by Section 80C, which expanded more options for the public to invest. Section 80C was the proverbial nudge to consumers to increase propensity to save and invest.

A tax prayer could claim exemption until Rs. 1.5 lakhs. There has been a steady rise in the number of tax payers from 2.69 crores in 2005-06 to 3.36 crores in 2013 to 6.77 crores on 31 July 2023, and many of these tax payers have enjoyed exemptions. Further, Income Tax provisions also helped tax payers to avail deductions for interest on home loans. Section 80EEA of theIncome Tax Act, 1961, came into effect from April 1, 2020. It allows a deduction for interest on a loan taken for specific house property. The Indian government provides tax benefits on home loans, primarily through deductions on the principal repayment and interest payment components. These tax incentives reduce the overall cost of homeownership, making it more affordable to borrowers.

According to Reserve Bank’s data, credit outstanding to the housing sector, primarily comprising home loans, has increased significantly by Rs 10 lakh crore during the last two years to a staggering Rs 27.22 lakh crore as of March 2024, marking a noteworthy rise from Rs 17.26 lakh crore recorded at the end of March 2022.

Fig 2: Household private savings as percentage of GDP

The July 2024 budget has changed all that. It has removed the indexation benefit available to asset classes like real estate and brought down the capital gains tax to 12.5% from the 20% with indexation available earlier.

Fig 3: New Tax treatment

This has ignited a debate on the purpose behind the government’s move, and its impact.

Impact of LTCG

A BankBazaar study used RBI’s House Price Index data for 10 major cities and found out that LTCG taxes on an average, increases 2.9 times without the indexation benefit. This study is based on RBI’s House Price Index (2011-2024) and the Cost Inflation Index. This report showed that without indexation, the long-term capital gains taxes rise significantly for all holding periods. The simulated holding periods for LTCG calculations in the study, range from 2 years to 13 years ending in March 2024. The report also shows that longer holding periods correlate with higher taxes with or without indexation. With indexation, the taxes are comparatively higher.

Another finding of the report is that the average indexed tax on LTCG in these 13 years (2010-2023) is 3.90. The report also shows that this average non-indexed tax rises 2.90 times to 11.34, implying additional taxes of 7.44. The report suggests that all taxes with indexation were 0 from 2016-17 whereas without indexation, the taxes rose considerably with values of 3.02 to 8.70. The report shows that because of indexation, there is no long-term capital gains from 2016-17. These seven years show long-term capital losses. Therefore, despite the 20 percent tax rate, the investor’s tax liability would be zero in these years. However, without indexation, there are huge leaps in the LTCG for all years including from 2016-17.

Impact on Savings

An NIPFP study estimates the effect of being in a taxable income bracket on the probability of having investments in specific financial products. They do this by examining portfolio formation using the CMIE Consumer Pyramids Household Survey Data for 2016–173. They find that the probability of investments in tax-favoured financial products is higher for households that are taxed. A disaggregated analysis of salaried households suggests that the tax-incentivised impact on saving is highest for salaried households in the income bracket of Rs 350,000 to Rs 500,000.

For households not subject to tax liability, household characteristics drive the probability of investments in insurance products. Thus, while aggregate financial saving has remained stable, tax breaks have been influential in driving savings into specific products, such as insurance and pensions. Till recently, physical savings of households were increasing. Now, with this new change in Long Term Capital Gains, there will be an impact.

Fig 4: Savings in physical assets

An appraisal of a capital gains tax includes particularly its effect on investment. Investment is one of the most important variables in economic development, and capital gains taxation is directly related to the supply of savings, the composition of investments, and the mobility of capital.

Conclusion

The union budget in the last few decades has played a defining role in providing through its provisions a discernible nudge to build public savings, the tax incentives due to savings have been provided across all asset classes, the PPF savings which are tax exempt indirectly support the bond markets, since a great chunk goes in investment in government securities. Other tax provisions have given tax exemptions in Equity-linked schemes. ULIPs are a dual instrument to help to insure and save. In few years reality sector got a boost, where money from the sale of property was incentivised to be invested back in the realty sector. Exempting interest on housing loans from taxation, and provision of tax treatment of repaying principal amount to be included for tax exemption. All this has helped real estate as an asset class to grow.

The history of incentivising savings, has since decades inculcated the habit of thrift among middle-class and lower-middle-class Indians. This has been the anchor and nest egg for the working-class population of India. Unlike the developed world, there exists no social security mechanism to buffer the middle class and poor. At best by incentivising savings the government nudged and encouraged the propensity to save. However, the new tax provision provides no such incentives. A demographic dividend where a large population is entering the workforce, will be left with no nudge to save is a failing indeed.

financialexpress.com,Explaining Budget 2024 announcements on GST and custom duty,"– By Manish Mishra and Tanay Vyas

The tax proposals contained in the Union Budget recently tabled before the parliament largely aim at bolstering domestic manufacturing, improving ease of doing business, reducing litigation and providing certainty in tax administration.

On the Import duty front, the emphasis is to boost domestic manufacturing, in line with the ‘Make in India’ and ‘Aatmnirbhar Bharat’ initiatives through rationalization of the Customs duty rates. Keeping in line with these objectives, certain exemptions are extended till March 2026 and 2029 respectively, whereas certain others are allowed to lapse on September 30, 2024. The rationalization of import tariffs is expected to continue further with a comprehensive review of the tariff structure announced to be undertaken in the next six months.

On the specific proposals, reduction in duty rates on mobile phones including their parts and accessories are aimed at incentivizing domestic manufacture as well as reducing prices for the end-customers. Exemptions extended to precious metals (gold, silver, platinum) along with ores and concentrates of copper, cobalt, tin and tungsten etc. as well as silicon to boost investment and manufacturing in the related sectors. In the healthcare sector, exemptions have been extended to certain life-saving drugs used for cancer treatment and polyethylene used in orthopaedic implants.

For the renewable sector, basic customs duty is increased on solar glass for manufacture of solar cells from Nil to 10%. This is neutralized by providing exemption on certain capital goods and their parts and extending the exemptions on import of certain critical goods used in manufacture of solar cells and modules. This is expected to incentivize manufacturing of solar cells and modules in India.

Benefits under the MOOWR scheme, which allows manufacturing operations to be carried out in bonded warehouses with duty-free imports of raw material and capital goods, are proposed to be restricted for specific sectors. While this step seems to be undertaken due to certain court pronouncements for the solar power sector, the same appears to be retrograde and does not send out positive signals to the investors. This should have been avoided, given the scheme has provided a significant boost to investment in the manufacturing sector.

There are certain other steps announced to facilitate trade and resolve disputes, such as providing retrospective exemption from levy of GST Compensation Cess on imports by SEZ units, extension of time limits for duty free re-imports and relaxed documentation in support of establishing country of origin in respect of imports under the free/ preferential trade agreements. However, one wonders if a dispute resolution scheme should have been announced to resolve pending customs duty litigation.

From a GST perspective, the focus seems to create more certainty in the tax administration and dispute resolution, considering the massive surge in the GST litigation. The tone was set through various clarifications issued by the Government post the 53rd GST Council meeting and the same is furthered in the proposals.

Rationalization in the adjudication processes in relation to Notices issued for FY 2024-25 onwards, waiver in interest and penalties subject to voluntary payment of taxes for initial years of GST, consideration of industry practices for resolution of disputes, retrospective extension in the dates for availment of ITC and announcement of a sunset clause for anti-profiteering provisions are steps in the right direction which should be welcomed by the Industry.

While infrastructure was stated to be one of the focus sectors, surprisingly there is not much of a change in the rate structure for the sector and status-quo is maintained. It was widely speculated that steps may be taken to address the issue of duty inversion faced by the sector, given that the output from the sector generally enjoys exemption or lower rate of GST whereas procurements suffer tax at median rate of eighteen percent leading to credit accumulation. A ‘deemed export’ status for the sector could be considered, whereby supplies by the sector may be eligible for refund or rebate of such accumulated credits.

To sum up, while the indirect tax proposals contained in the Budget aim at creating a taxpayer friendly environment by focussing on ease of compliances and dispute resolution, it appears that Government has stopped short on taking affirmative measures which could have provided impetus to investments in key sectors and eased the burden of GST on the end consumers. However, given that this was the first budget for the newly elected Government, it certainly sets out the tone for future steps that may be undertaken in this regard in the times to come.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024 rekindles hope for reforms in real estate,"The Union Budget 2024 was being called the ‘Budget of Hope’ not without reason. Amidst economic fluctuations and pricing challenges, this budget marks a significant step forward, introducing key reforms and increased funding that promise to reshape the real estate industry’s landscape.

The budget has introduced a number of key reforms, addressing the sector’s long-standing issues while simultaneously pushing for growth and development. However, real estate developers and investors find themselves cautiously optimistic and would be closely observing on how these reforms are implemented.

One of the most notable changes is the reduction in long-term Capital Gains Tax. This move, aimed at simplifying the tax structure, comes with a trade-off: the removal of indexation benefits. While this may cause some initial concern among investors, the overall impact is expected to stimulate market activity. The ambitious plan to construct 3 crore additional houses in urban and rural areas stands as a testament to the government’s commitment to affordable housing. This initiative, coupled with the Urban 2.0 program investing Rs 10 lakh crore for 1 crore urban families, presents a ray of hope for both the working class and developers. However, the industry would have some scepticism with regards to the intensity of these impact of these measures on the developers.

Urban development takes center stage in this budget, with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) seeing a substantial increase in allocation from Rs 69,270.72 crore in FY2023-24 to Rs 82,576.57 crore for FY2024-25. This boost underscores the government’s vision of cities as growth hubs and urban development as a key priority. In a move towards inclusivity, the budget announces reductions in stamp duties and special considerations for women homeowners. This progressive step is expected to open up new market segments and encourage wider participation in property ownership. Digitization emerges as a crucial theme, with the implementation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) set to revolutionize transactions between buyers and builders. The allocation of Rs 1150.02 crore for the National Urban Digital Mission further emphasizes the Government’s commitment to modernizing the sector.

Despite these positive developments, the real estate industry’s long-standing demand for ‘Industry Status’ remains unaddressed. The absence of this recognition, along with the lack of GST rationalization, continues to create challenges in offering competitive pricing to buyers. Many industry experts argue that granting industry status could be the key to unlocking the sector’s full potential.

As we look to the future, the 2024 Union Budget sets a hopeful tone for real estate in India. While it may not have delivered on all fronts, it has certainly laid the groundwork for significant growth and development. The ambitious housing initiatives and focus on urban development paint a promising picture, but there’s still room for further dialogue on policy reforms.

The coming months will be crucial as the industry adapts to these changes and continues to push for additional reforms. For now, stakeholders in the real estate sector can take heart in the government’s clear signal of support and commitment to progress. The journey towards a fully reformed and vibrant real estate market continues, one budget at a time.

financialexpress.com,Critical Minerals in the Union Budget 2024-2025: Steering through the Headwinds,"By Araudra Singh

The growing significance of critical minerals across the international community, including for developing economies like India cannot be overstated. Imperatives of India’s industrialization and Sustainable Development Goals have amplified the nation’s reliance on these minerals. With their applicability in sectors ranging from high tech and telecommunications to renewables and defence, the Economic Survey of 2022-23 deemed the critical minerals as an upcoming “geopolitical battleground”, signs of which are already apparent. The salience of these indispensable reserves is not only evident by New Delhi’s international engagement in the recent past but also by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s recent Union Budget speech in Lok Sabha.

Plans Charted in the Union Budget

The Finance Minister stated the government’s intentions to set up a Critical Mineral Mission for domestic production, recycling, and overseas acquisition of critical minerals. Its mandate would also include technology development, a skilled workforce, an extended producer responsibility framework, and a financing mechanism. Furthermore, the Minister during her speech, proposed to fully exempt customs duties on 25 critical minerals and reduce basic custom duties on two of the minerals. Both announcements entail significant implications.

Firstly, establishing a Critical Mineral Mission reflects national objectives of not only securing resilient domestic supply chains to mitigate strategic vulnerabilities presented by geopolitical uncertainties, supply chain disruptions, and import dependence on China, but also leveraging foreign reserves, technology, and capital through trusted bilateral and multilateral partnerships. Secondly, the statement is also emblematic of the official desire to foster technological advancement across the critical mineral value chains. Thirdly, the plan to exempt custom duties, besides securing the resources to strategic sectors in a cost-effective manner, is also likely to nudge India’s pace towards a clean energy transition, including the manufacturing of electric vehicles (EV). Lastly, exemption on duties would also enhance global competitiveness across a range of sectors in which the critical minerals are used for manufacturing vital components.

Addressing the Infirmities in the Supply Chains

India’s objective to develop entire value chains for the resources faces multipronged challenges. While the last four fiscal years have seen Union allocations to the Ministry of Mines, overseeing these critical assets rise, the disbursement for capital expenditure has been on a declining trend. Limited fiscal room for capital expenditure is worrying and antithetical to the budget and Critical Mineral Strategy’s focus on boosting domestic production, recycling, and innovation financing. Increasing industrial demands for resources, and the lack of extraction, processing and recycling technology and facilities warrant a significant increase in the Centre’s allocation for capital expenditure. Given the ever-increasing long-term criticality of the minerals, it does not seem to be ideal to be primarily dependent on private or foreign direct investment.

While critical minerals are found in large volumes across the globe, extracting and refining them is not only technologically intensive but also costly. Failing to receive the required number of minimum bidders, the Ministry of Mines recently scrapped the auction of lithium blocks for the second time in five months. The lacklustre response from the investors draws from India’s outdated resource classification rules, lacking adequate information regarding the economic viability of mining a block. Information on economically viable reserves with high geological confidence remains an imperative for mining firms, given the expensive extraction process.

Unlike exploration and manufacturing, the midstream activities i.e., processing and refining, which is the most important part of critical mineral value chains have not attracted requisite attention from the government, including through recent amendment to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. Consequently, the metal refining infrastructure such as vapor metallurgy needs to be amongst the official priorities to sustainably refine these minerals, without which an indigenous reliable ecosystem for minerals would remain elusive. Attaining capabilities to sustainably transform primary and secondary sources to intermediate materials calls for investment, especially in R&D to support research beyond the current laboratory-scale studies.

Subsequent to processing and refining, manufacturing and recycling part of the value chains also merit serious discussions among the policymakers. As technology evolves, India’s economy in future will be further underpinned by technologies that depend on minerals such as lithium, graphite, cobalt, titanium, and rare earth elements. For instance, the critical minerals input required in the manufacturing of an EV is six times that of a traditional car. Already, seven of the total thirteen sectors in the Production-Linked Incentives (PLI) scheme involve these critical assets in manufacturing vital components, such as solar PV modules and auto components. Besides, there are only seven recycling plants in India that can extract reusable materials from used batteries, which is particularly concerning given very limited domestic reserves. India’s burgeoning industrial needs, abundant e-waste and restricted mineral reserves signal the need for investment in cost-effective manufacturing and recycling plants. Amidst price volatility, surging global demand for clean energy technologies, and acute supply and geopolitical risks for minerals, including those considered critical by India, boosting recycling capabilities remains not only an environment-friendly option but also key to secure and cost-effective supply. India’s trajectory towards clean energy goals is expected to generate EV market growth at a CAGR of 49% till 2030. Thus, investing in recycling facilities that can extract and refurbish lithium-ion batteries also necessitates the government’s imminent consideration.

Recycling of critical minerals is expected to upscale going forward since one of the mandates of the Critical Mineral Mission as prescribed by the Union budget is the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework. The rules based on the concept of EPR and relevant to critical minerals are E-Waste Management Rules, 2022 and Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022. While these rules are expected to bring new technologies and investment in the recycling and refurbishment industry, both are riddled with inherent flaws.

In May 2023, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) made representation to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) asking for a one-year deferral of EPR obligations to private telecom operators. The telecom body wrote to the Ministry as the industry was not consulted regarding the average life-cycle of telecom and broadcasting equipment. The end-of-life disposal timeframe imposed under the EPR rules could increase compliance costs and capital expenditure, potentially affecting the network, since the obligations enforced are not in sync with real-world life cycles of products. Also, the weighty targets imposed which make it difficult to absorb the compliance costs as often argued by smaller businesses, merits a reappraisal. The e-waste rules also involve a stark omission. The provision for levying “environmental compensation” to producers, manufacturers, refurbishers, and recyclers for violating norms, does not contain a specified quantum of penalty. Similarly, Battery Waste Management Regulations are also not clear on the penalty imposed for violation of EPR targets and obligations. The rules for battery management also lack a directive on the funds that producers should pay to recyclers for obtaining EPR certificates or fulfilling obligations. This ambiguity can potentially affect the sum paid for waste collection and refurbishing to recyclers. It’s clear that both the rules have their respective loopholes and discrepancies which need to be resolved first, for streamlined implementation of the EPR framework.

Another line of decree entrusted in the Critical Mineral Mission is the skilling of the workforce. Having a skilled workforce and expertise across the value chains is equally salient, which would primarily require leveraging the technical expertise of Western partners like the US, and Australia through knowledge sharing and joint research arrangements. Considering India is the only developing nation in the US-led Mineral Security Partnership (MSP), it would do well to play its cards right and actualise objectives of becoming self-reliant in supply chains by collaborating in capacity-building initiatives in both upstream and midstream activities. While joint ventures in mining, processing, and R&D efforts in sustainable mining technology and extraction practices remain significant, it would serve India well to give partnership with Global South equal weightage. Collaborating with developing countries rich in mineral reserves like Argentina, Brazil and Chile is equally important in avoiding supply chain disruptions. The partnership with Latin American states cannot be merely mineral acquisition or joint exploration but also involve quid pro quo entailing Indian investments in sustainable extraction and processing infrastructure, which they lack.

Therefore, it’s clear that while the Union Budget 2024-25 strikes the right chord vis-à-vis critical minerals, the real challenge lies in implementation. India’s quest for reliable, diversified, and sustainable supply chains for critical minerals is set to be of paramount importance whilst it continues to balance environmental sustainability and developmental growth. Consequently, in the short term, the relevant waste management rules and official reporting standards need to be amended to shun ambiguities and make them attuned to the ground realities of the industry. Whereas, in the longer run, besides collaborating with like-minded and technologically advanced countries, India’s pursuit to become self-reliant across the value chains needs a significant upscale in capital expenditure, including in R&D.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024 – Buy-back tax: The debate continues,"– By Prashant Kapoor and Milan Khanna

Ms. Nirmala Sitaraman, Honorable Finance Minister of India, tabled the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024. The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes to overhaul buy-back taxation regime by bringing in significant amendments to the buy-back tax provisions.

What is Buy-back? – Buy-back of shares means purchase of its own shares by the company from the existing shareholders at a price decided by the Board thereby reducing the number of outstanding shares.

Recently, the corporate world has witnessed a surge in buy-back of shares by cash rich companies including multiple large cap companies that preferred buy-back of shares over conventional distribution of dividend to incentivize shareholders. FY2023-24 recorded the highest spent on buy-back in last 5 years, recording a staggering aggregate distribution of ~INR 51 billion by 41 companies (source: Buy-back offers yearly database by Prime Database, a database focusing on capital market offerings).

At present, buy-back tax @ 23.3% is to be paid by the company on the distributed income. Distributed income means the consideration paid by the company on buy-back of shares as reduced by the amount which was received on issue of such shares (determined in the manner prescribed). Further, the income arising to the shareholders in respect of such buy-back is exempt and not subject to additional tax.

In order to bring parity between tax implications on distribution of dividend (that shifts the burden of tax on the recipient shareholders) and the buy-back, the Finance Bill proposes to tax:

The entire amount received on buy-back of shares as dividend in the hands of shareholders as per their respective tax slabs. The Finance Bill has amended the definition of ‘dividend’ to provide that the amount received from the company towards buy-back will obtain the characteristics of dividend since the expression used is ‘any payment’ vis-à-vis ‘any distribution’ as stated in the other clause for dividend definition. Accordingly, the gross amount would be taxable for shareholders and withholding obligations would be casted on the company undertaking buy-back of shares as similar in the case of dividend.

The cost of acquisition of shares tendered in the buy-back will be considered as a capital loss in the hands of shareholders, which will be eligible for set-off against other capital gains or carry forward for a period of 8 years.

The new tax provisions will be effective from October 1, 2024. The amendment in buy-back taxation proposed in the Union Budget 2024 mark a significant shift in the regulatory landscape governing corporate share buy-backs and is poised to reshape the dynamics of capital distribution and investment strategies for companies as well as investors.

With the applicability of dividend taxation on buy-back, investors may witness a reduced overall return on investment as they would end up paying higher taxes on the entire buy-back amount and not on the real gains (i.e., amount received on buy-back less the amount invested). The increased tax liability will make the investments less attractive for investors.

Also Read SEBI developing AI tool to check IPO documents filed by companies for faster approvals: Madhabi Buch

The cost of acquisition for the bought-back shares shall be available as capital losses to the investors which shall be adjusted against capital gains.

While the investors would be able to carry forward this capital loss for a period of 8 years, they would not derive any benefit until sufficient capital gains are generated to utilize such losses.

The Union Budget, 2024 should have provided for an upfront cost base deduction to the shareholders rather than shifting this to a future capital gains event.

Interestingly, the proposed amendment expands the scope of deemed dividend. Under all exiting clauses, deemed dividend applies only if the company has accumulated profits (whether capitalized or not ). However, the proposed amendment contradicts from the very genesis of these provisions i.e., the deemed dividend under these provisions will apply irrespective of whether the company undertaking a buyback has profits or not.

In nutshell, the Government has plugged the loophole, narrowing down the tax arbitrage between distributing accumulated reserves through dividend and through buy-back of shares. The proposed buy-back taxation framework necessitates companies to comply with the updated tax provisions and reporting requirements and may have a negative impact on capital markets. Companies engaging in buy-back will need to carefully assess the tax implications and ensure accurate tax withholdings at the time of buy-back.

financialexpress.com,Assessing the Union Budget 2024-25 implications for real estate,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget for FY2024-25 outlines an ambitious plan to transform India into a developed nation under the vision of “Viksit Bharat.” This budget places a strong emphasis on urban and infrastructure development, human capital enhancement, manufacturing growth, MSMEs, and driving consumption, identifying nine priority areas for sustained efforts: agriculture productivity and resilience, employment and skilling, inclusive human resource development and social justice, manufacturing and services, urban development, energy security, infrastructure, innovation and R&D, and next-generation reforms.

Not dissimilar in approach to her first budget, which was also presented after the previous Lok Sabha win, this budget largely aims for longer term goals, with a sprinkling of near-term objectives. The focus this time, however, is on a wider range of items, including agriculture, MSMEs, manufacturing, urban and infrastructure development, the start-up economy, and much more.

Urban and infrastructure development take center stage in this budget, with manufacturing and housing positioned as primary beneficiaries. The ‘Cities as Growth Hubs’ initiative aims to rejuvenate urban areas under strain. Key measures include Transit Oriented Development for 14 large cities and a framework for creative brownfield redevelopment.

A significant allocation of INR 15,000 crore for the development of Andhra Pradesh’s capital city underscores the government’s commitment to urban infrastructure. This financial support is expected to catalyze significant real estate development in the region, enhancing market confidence and encouraging investment. Additionally, the budget’s emphasis on manufacturing, through the extension of the Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs, the establishment of industrial parks and corridors, and e-commerce export hubs, is poised to boost the country’s economic performance, with the warehousing real estate segment standing to benefit significantly from these initiatives.

The budget also addresses urban and rural development through measures such as interest subsidies for rental housing, PPP models for rental housing for industrial workers, and the addition of 3 crore housing units under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). These initiatives are designed to tackle the housing shortage and improve living standards in both urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the government’s decision to increase the standard deduction and lower tax slabs in the new tax regime for personal income tax is likely to increase disposable incomes among the middle-income group, thereby boosting demand in the affordable and mid-income housing segments.

The single most spoken of point from real estate perspective is that of long-term capital gains (LTGC) tax, coupled with the removal of indexation benefits. While this sounds like an onerous burden at first, deeper analysis reveals a different picture. A full-scale analysis is out of scope for this essay here; but it is clear that properties held over long time frames that have benefitted from strong price upswings of 7-8 times attract lesser LTCG under the new LTGC of 12.5% (14.95% effective tax) without indexation, than the previous 20% LTGC with indexation. This could have far-reaching implications, especially in curbing over-zealous investor activity, as against end-use purchases.

Moreover, the budget’s capex-led growth strategy, with an outlay of 3.4% of GDP amounting to INR 11.1 lakh crore, demonstrates fiscal prudence with a planned reduction in the fiscal deficit to 4.9% of GDP. This robust financial planning, along with strategic urban development policies, is set to create new urban clusters and spur real estate development across the country.

While the direct-tax part perhaps left a bit to be desired, it needs to be remembered that the finance minister has to present another full budget in about 6-7 months. The present budget lays a solid foundation for sustained economic growth, with urbanisation, manufacturing, infrastructure, and of course real estate sector being beneficiaries at this point. Agriculture and MSMEs were big focus areas too, and as elections loom in several states, it was just about a reasonable attempt to cover various crucial sectors for an effective 6-7 month period.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: New capital gains taxation rules offer fresh opportunities for HNI investors – Here’s how,"The recent Union Budget 2024 has introduced significant reforms in capital gains taxation, reshaping the investment landscape for High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs). I believe these changes warrant a thoughtful reassessment of investment strategies, although not necessarily a drastic overhaul. So, the question isn’t whether you should act – it’s how Thoughtfully portfolio allocations are made going forward to capitalize on these changes.

The new tax regime, already in force, has leveled the playing field across various asset classes. While this shift doesn’t call for knee-jerk reactions, it does present an opportune moment for HNIs to review their portfolios. The key is to evaluate how recent market rallies have impacted asset allocations and whether adjustments are needed to align with individual risk appetites and financial goals.

The revised long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax now provides a more favorable environment for overseas investments, subject to RBI limits for mutual funds. International funds, previously subject to debt taxation, now enjoy parity with Indian equities, albeit with a 24-month holding period for LTCG classification, down from 36 months earlier. This change opens new avenues for global diversification, a strategy that HNIs should seriously consider.

In the real estate sector, the tax reforms have brought about a positive shift, aligning it with equity for taxation purposes. This simplification is particularly beneficial for new real estate buyers. However, the impact of losing indexation benefits will be felt by those holding historical properties, especially those acquired before 2001 or properties where appreciation hasn’t outpaced inflation. These owners might face slightly higher capital gains taxes. While housing demand remains strong, we might see a reduction in speculative investments in urban areas, with investors potentially exiting properties that don’t appreciate rapidly enough. This segment could potentially redirect their allocations to financial markets. Overall, we’re observing a growing trend among investors towards understanding and appreciating the unique advantages of equity investing.

When it comes to unlisted shares, the tax harmonisation strategy now aligns rates with those of listed shares. This creates an intriguing opportunity for HNIs to explore the unlisted equity market. Other investment options that have become more attractive include overseas funds, gold funds, REITs/INVITs, and Equity Fund of Funds, all now taxed at 12.5% for LTCG. Foreign equity/debt, unlisted equity, and physical gold, if held for 24 months, also fall under this tax bracket. This clarity in tax structure allows investors to choose instruments that best suit their risk appetite and holding horizon.

It’s also worth noting that the marginal increase in capital gains tax on listed equities is unlikely to dampen investor sentiment significantly. The domestic inflow story remains strong, underpinned by the robust growth prospects of the Indian economy and equity markets.

While the Budget 2024 tax reforms have indeed reshaped the investment terrain, they also present new opportunities for astute investors. HNIs should view this as a chance to optimise their portfolios, diversifying across both domestic and international markets, and exploring asset classes that now offer more favorable tax treatment. The key lies in making informed decisions based on an understanding of these changes, aligning investments with long-term financial goals, and maintaining a balanced approach to risk and return.

financialexpress.com,How Budget 2024 proposals will ease the cashflow for salaried taxpayers,"By Divya Baweja

July 23 marked a significant milestone as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, the first Budget of the government’s third term. Amidst expectations of economic revival and relief for various sectors, the Budget outlined a comprehensive strategy aimed at fostering inclusive growth and boosting the economy.

One of the highlights of this year’s Budget is the proposed modification of the tax slabs under the new regime, which has been a focus area of the government. In the new tax regime, the income tax rates are set to undergo the following changes:

Moreover, the standard deduction for salaried employees is proposed to increase from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000, providing further relief to taxpayers. These revisions are expected to provide tax savings up to Rs 17,500 for a salaried taxpayer under the new regime.

The Budget further proposes an increase in deduction related to family pension for pensioners opting for the New Tax Regime, raising it from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000. This is aimed at improving the financial well-being of pensioners and providing them with greater disposable incomes.

Further, in a bid to enhance social security benefits, the Budget proposes an increase in the deduction of employer’s contribution towards the National Pension System (NPS) from 10% to 14% of the employee’s salary for those opting for the new tax regime. This move is expected to encourage more taxpayers to opt for the new tax regime.

The Budget also aims to rationalize the taxation of capital gains, proposing a simplified structure. The holding period has been limited to two periods only – 12 months and 24 months – to determine if an asset is a long-term or a short-term capital asset.

Further, long-term gains on all financial and non-financial assets will now attract a uniform tax rate of 12.5%. Hence, the tax rate for long-term capital gains on STT paid listed securities and units of equity-oriented funds has increased from 10% to 12.5%, above Rs 125,000 (as against Rs 100,000 under the current provisions); however, the tax rate for long term capital gains on all other assets has been reduced from 20% to 12.5%. Moreover, the benefit of indexation, which was earlier available on long term capital assets, has been proposed to be abolished.

While for listed bonds and debentures, the rate shall be reduced to 12.5%, capital gains on unlisted debentures and unlisted bonds shall still be taxed at applicable slab rates, irrespective of whether it is a short-term or long-term gain.

Concurrently, short-term capital gains (STCG) on listed equity shares and units of equity-oriented mutual funds will see an increase in the tax rate from the existing 15% to 20%.

To ease the cashflow for salaried taxpayers, it has been proposed that the tax collected at source, or any other deduction of tax, be allowed while arriving at the remaining tax liability by employers. This is a welcome move which shall result in reducing the claims for refund while filing the tax return.

Similarly, positive changes have been proposed in the Budget to provide relief to taxpayers under the Black Money Law and in reducing the time for issuing notices for reassessment.

The above changes made by the Hon’ble FM aim to make the new tax regime more attractive, which is in line with the thinking of the government. On the contrary, the increase in the capital gains rate for STT paid listed securities and units of equity-oriented funds may dampen the spirit of investors.

Overall, the Budget seems to be moving in the direction of simplifying the tax laws, to make life easer for the taxpayers.

thehindu.com,"FM Nirmala Sitharaman on Budget 2024: Union Budget strikes a fine balance between growth, employment, capital investment, and fiscal consolidation","Replying to the debate on the Union Budget in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday where more than 80 elders participated, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the transfer of resources to the States is going unhindered and the inferences that she mentioned just two States in the budget was a propaganda created by the INDIA bloc to mislead the people.

Comparing the allocation to various social sectors and the devolution of taxes to the States under the UPA and NDA regimes, she said the Narendra Modi-led government implemented the concept of cooperative federalism by giving due share to all States.

Countering the allegation that the Budget mentions just two States, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, Ms. Sitharaman said the Opposition created a propaganda to mislead people. “The Budget is for all States,” she said adding that the practice of mentioning the names of all States was not there during the UPA regime too. “If a State has not been mentioned in the speech, it does not mean there is no allocation for it,” she said.

She said it was wrong to calculate devolution based on gross tax receipts, and then allege that the Centre is devolving less than what is suggested by the Finance Commission. “I would like to underline our unflinching commitment to cooperative federalism. The total resources proposed to be transferred to the States in 2024-25 are estimated at ₹22.91 lakh crore. This actually entails an increase of ₹2.49 lakh crore over 2023-24,” she said.

Ms. Sitharaman said the capital expenditure too increased manifold during the last 10 years. The capital expenditure, she said, is estimated at ₹11.11 lakh crore. “This is the biggest ever allocation for capital expenditure and it shows increase of about 17% over the revised estimates and provisional actuals of 2023-24,” she said and added that during the 10 years of the UPA, it was ₹13.19 lakh crore. “Whereas during our tenure from 2014 to 2024, the allocation for capex has been ₹43.82 lakh crore from 2014-15 to 2023-24,” she said.

Replying to the discussion on the Budget of Jammu and Kashmir, she said the financial condition of the Union Territory has improved in the last two years. Earlier practices of running ‘hundis’ and overdrafts from J&K Bank have been discontinued and the day-to-day cash management is much healthier than the past, she said. “During the last four years, J&K Bank has made a remarkable turnaround. From a loss of ₹ 1,139 crore in 2019-20, the bank had a profit of ₹1,700 crore in the year 2023-24,” she added.

On the conduct of NEET medical entrance tests, she said the entrance examination has ensured cost-effective medical education for families. “Certainly, it has hurt some vested interests, particularly those in the medical education field because no longer selling medical seats is possible. Therefore, it has hurt a lot of people. That is why a particular lobby was actively against NEET even before this NEET leak issue has come up,” she said.

On the Agnipath military recruitment scheme, the Minister said the scheme will ensure that India has younger soldiers who are on the frontline. “One of the expected outcome of the scheme is that armed forces will have a much younger force by recruiting those in the age group of 17.5-21 years,” she said. “And I don’t think there is a need for us to unnecessarily worry that this is causing some kind of distortion. Not at all. It is with the acceptance of the armed forces that it has been brought in,” Ms. Sitharaman added.",Left,Center-Right,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-strikes-a-fine-balance-between-growth-employment-capital-investment-and-fiscal-consolidation-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-tells-rajya-sabha/article68468428.ece
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Pathway to a Viksit Bharat,"– By Suman Chowdhury

The Union Budget of July 2024 outlines not just short term fiscal measures but also a strategic roadmap for economic and fiscal policies over the next five years. With a focus on fiscal consolidation, rationalization of taxation structure and a reboot of the manufacturing sector, the budget also prioritizes long-term goals like employment generation through incentives and skilling initiatives, crucial steps towards the goal of Viksit Bharat.

Simply use facial recognition to complete transactions — no cash, cards, or mobile phones needed Road EPC companies to report slower revenue growth of 5-7% next fiscal, says CRISIL

Fiscal Consolidation

The budget reaffirms the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation, aiming for a fiscal deficit below 4.5% by FY26 after targeting a 4.9% figure in FY25 based on a realistic growth in tax revenues. From FY27, the focus will shift to a gradual reduction of the Central Government debt as a proportion of GDP. From a low of 3.4% in FY19, the fiscal deficit spiked to 9.2% in FY21 due to COVID-19, followed by a steady decline to 5.6% in FY24. The government improved on the last fiscal’s deficit target by 30 bps and now revised the current year target by 20 bps over the interim budget.

Employment Generation

Three new schemes will incentivize job creation for both new employees and employers, targeting the creation of over 2 Crore new jobs, which will positively impact private consumption over the medium term.

Manufacturing Ecosystem

The budget emphasizes the developing of a robust manufacturing sector, especially through MSMEs, to generate employment. Measures include:

– A separate guarantee fund for MSME loans up to Rs 100 Cr.

– Additional loans for stressed MSMEs.

– An expanded TReDS platform for better working capital funding.

Policies were announced to improve the manufacturing infrastructure through new industrial parks, rental housing for industrial workers, and the ship leasing industry, further supported by large outlays for skilling programs.

Infrastructure Development

With a capital expenditure allocation of Rs 11.1 tn, a 16% growth over the previous year, the government aims to accelerate infrastructure development, particularly boosting the order book of construction companies post general elections. Special focus is on infrastructural development in Bihar and AP, and tourism infrastructure in several states.

Agricultural Transformation

Policy measures to enhance crop diversity, mitigate climate risks, and moderate food inflation include initiatives for self-reliance in pulses and oilseeds and developing urban-centred vegetable production clusters. Establishing a digital land registry backbone is a pivotal reform for the agricultural sector.

Sustainability and Energy

While the budget falls short on some sustainability fronts such as EVs, it includes measures to support indigenous manufacture of batteries and solar cells by reducing customs duties on essential components. Policies to diversify alternative energy sources, such as pumped hydro projects and small modular nuclear reactors, aim to enhance the renewable energy mix in the grid, essential for achieving the 2030 SDGs.

Tax Reforms

Adjustments in tax slabs under the new regime and a moderate increase in the standard deduction will reduce tax payouts for mid-income salaried employees, potentially boosting consumption and encouraging transition to the simpler tax regime. However, higher tax payouts on capital gains will impact those with significant equity market incomes.

Overall, the 2024 budget is structured to support long-term economic growth through strategic thrust on infrastructure, manufacturing, and employment generation, aligning with the broader vision of a Viksit Bharat.

Mainpuri MP Dimple Yadav proposes formative changes required in the country

Speaking at the discussion of the Union Budget, Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav argued that reformative changes and evolution can come in the country even after eleven years, however, it would require “dedication and concentration”. Ms Yadav proposed that instead of focussing on the past, it was imperative that government acts responsibly and responds adequately to evolving situations.

During her address, the Mainpuri MP touched upon various issues relevant to agriculture and employment.

About agriculture, Ms Yadav sought what the treasury had allocated for building necessary agricultural infrastructure, building mandis in Uttar Pradesh and towards cattle management. She also sought the government to put forth how much allocation has been curtailed for crop insurance.

About unemployment, the Mainpuri MP sought that the government must ensure 100 days of wages under MNREGA. She put forth that employment was as high as 9.2% with unemployment among women being further high at 18.5%.

With respect to education, Ms Yadav accused the treasury of having curtailed funds to the UGC. According to her, the intent of the treasury in this regard was “questionable”.

In her address, Ms Yadav also sought the intervention of both the central and state govts to make operational the Cancer Institute in Lucknow. “Cancer cases are on the rise in the country. I am sure that making operational the institute would be a step towards according affordable treatment,” she told the house.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-session-live-updates-july-29/article68459144.ece
financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: A blueprint for sustainable growth and development,"By Pooja Misra

“Tripartite compact” a term given in the Economic Survey has resonated pretty strongly with many of us. The survey states that for the country to be a Viksit Bharat by 2047, a tripartite compact is needed between the Centre, State and Private industry be it in terms of land and labour reforms and/or between the Government, Private Sector and Academia for skill development and job creation.

The Indian economy has remained robust, demonstrated resilience in the face of geopolitical challenges and achieved a GDP growth of 8.2% in the previous financial year, but for India to be a Viksit Bharat by 2047 and move towards equitable growth and away from a K-shaped growth there are certain key challenges that the country needs to address. While we have suitably grown from a low-income economy to a low-middle-income nation with our GDP per capita being in the range of $2730.77 approx. as against that of China being $13,136.48 and US and UK being 85,372.69 and $51,074.79 respectively, to be a Viksit Bharat by 2047 we need to focus on addressing these challenges and not get caught in ‘the middle-income trap’.

What does the Employment Data show:

To begin with, the one challenge that has been on the forefront for quite some time now is unemployment. The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) – Quarterly Bulletin for January – March 2024 showed that the unemployment rate in urban areas in India stood at 6.7% as against a global unemployment rate of 5.1% (World Bank, 2023). As per RBI KLEMS data, all-India unemployment rate (UR) had declined to a 20-month low of 7% (May 2024), however, the Economic survey itself acknowledges that, to cater to the rising workforce the Indian economy needs to generate an average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs annually until 2030 in the non-farm sector.

The numbers for Labour Force Participation rate (LFPR) and Female Labour Force Participation (FLFPR) in urban areas in India show that it has increased to 50.2% and 25.6% respectively in January – March 2024, yet when we compare the LFPR to World Bank data it shows that at a global level the LFPR was at 66.3% in 2022 and FLFPR stood at 49% in 2023, thus highlighting the fact that the country still has some way to go. Yes, the Government has done well in designing of the three Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) schemes which should give the much-needed boost to increased LFPR, employment and private investment. Interestingly, this would also lead to the formalisation of labour and to a certain extent address the issue of private investment not taking off and work favorably for the economy.

Increased Private Capex – need of the hour

As stated in the Economic Survey it is high time that private investment cycle takes off and does the heavy lifting. An increase in private capital expenditure, will lead to companies expanding operations, investing in new technologies and creation of jobs. With the Government focusing on and calling for ‘all hands on deck’, laying stress on a ‘tripartite compact’, an investment-led growth should create jobs, enhance productivity, build long-term economic capacity and lay the foundation for sustainable long-term growth for the nation. With capacity utilization numbers of India Inc. being in the region of 74%-80%, the logical next step is increased private capital expenditure.

Also read: Union Budget 2024: Strategic Investments Propel Growth in Space, Defence, and Innovation

While sectors such as steel, cement, construction, real estate have been showing increased private capex, however we know that it is not broad based and as given in the Economic Survey private gross fixed capital formation in machinery & equipment and intellectual property is yet to take off. The ELI for manufacturing could give the much-needed push. The silver lining on the wall being that in addition to incentivising for private investment to increase in the Union Budget 2024-25, there is continuity being maintained in the govt. capex with an allocation of 11.11 lakh crore. Increased government capex results in boosting growth, gives rise to employment opportunities for the skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled persons and has a multiplier impact on the core sectors of the economy.

Time and cost overruns for Government Projects need to be monitored:

However, in reference to the government capital expenditure what is much needed is that there should be close monitoring of projects in relation to time and cost overrun. Just to quote latest data, the Indian government’s cost overruns in central government projects reached a 12-month high of 20.09% in April 2024, with 1,838 projects with a value of Rs 150 crore and above costing Rs 33.2 lakh crore, while the time overrun has dipped from 36.04 months in March to 35.4 months in April with 48% of projects delayed for over two years.

MSMEs: A Key Integral Constituent of the Economy

The plus point in the budget being that the Government has done well by providing the boost to the MSME sector through credit guarantee scheme etc. The highlight being e-commerce export hubs to be set-up to enable MSMEs and traditional artisans to market their produce in international markets which should logically give a boost to the One District, One Product scheme and help in balanced regional development.

Another positive from the budget is that with a reduction in the fiscal deficit target to 4.9% of GDP for this FY (moving fast on the glide path), the crowding out effect due to government borrowings will be lowered and leave ample space in the financial flow and availability of funds for the private sector and will also give added advantage to the small and medium sector.

Land and Labour reforms needed for Viksit Bharat 2047:

Also to add, while the Government has been moving in the right direction with its China + 1 policy, PLI schemes etc, however, for the same to fructify, with ease of doing business as its central focus, next-generation structural and economic reforms are much needed not only to be devised, but also implemented and executed especially in the context of land and labour policies. Reforms in the land acquisition policy is a key area that the government needs to address and address fast. Agreeably, digitisation of land records, creating digitised cadastral maps are key steps which can ensure effective implementation of land acquisition policy but we need to move faster on the land acquisition reform so that it becomes an enabler and does not remain a deterrent for industry. Similar is the case with the labor reforms. Here is where the tripartite compact between the Centre, States and private sector needs to move into action.

Effective implementation of Training and Skill Development Programmes:

Training and skill development programs aligning with industry needs have been the call of the day for quite some time now. While, 1,000 Industrial Training Institutes to be upgraded in hub and spoke arrangements with outcome orientation, 20 lakh youth to be skilled over a 5-year period and course content & design aligned as per skill needs of industry are all steps in the right direction and has good intent behind it but, what needs to be seen and closely monitored is its execution on the ground. Skills that make individuals more employable and adaptable to changing job requirements and consequently bring down structural unemployment need to be identified and worked upon by the academia hand in hand with the industry. Equal onus for re-designing of course curriculum lies with the academia and industry. Yes, the announcement that one crore youth would receive internship opportunities in the top 500 companies will prove to be a significant investment in skill development programs and provide a solid foundation for a workforce prepared for the future, but if we want to be a Viksit Bharat by 2047, this is an area in which the Government, academicians and industry need to come together and work.

Quality Employment will build a Viksit Bharat

To be a Viksit Bharat by 2047, not only job creation but, quality employment is what we would need and the same can be an outcome of research and development, increased domestic manufacturing wherein skilled labour is employed, expansion of exports especially in areas catering to labour-intensive manufacturing and signing of more free trade agreements. Rather, it might be a good idea that that when FTAs are signed the details of the same should be percolated down to the MSMEs especially the ones engaged in exports as that would help them strategise their production plan accordingly and reap higher returns.

Urban Development a key focal point

Not to miss, with 68% of the world population projected to live in urban areas by 2050 (United Nations, 2018) and with India, China and Nigeria expected to be accounting for as high as 35% of the projected growth of the global population between 2018 and 2050, investing in building of sustainable urban infrastructure is a head that cannot be ignored and the Government has done well by stating that ‘Cities are the growth hubs’ and ‘Creative redevelopment of cities’ and ‘Transit Oriented Development plans for 14 large cities with a population above 30 lakh is much needed’. Strategically designed sustainable infrastructure facilitates long term sustainable urban expansion, while minimising resource depletion and mitigating environmental damage.

All growth engines needed to fire

Last but most importantly, it has been a much-discussed fact time and again, that the nation needs to fire on all its growth engines especially Private Final Consumption expenditure. While increased employment should give the much-needed boost to private consumption this will bear fruits only in the medium term. Increasing money in the hands of people to spend especially the middle and lower income strata of society could be a solution worth exploring. Yes, while some comfort has been provided to individuals who opt for the new tax scheme, however, a more innovative approach, such as bringing petrol and diesel under the GST ambit, may give a significant boost to the economy in the short term too.

thehindu.com,What are the political implications? - The Hindu,"In a Budget speech sans poetry but filled with political pragmatism, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman kept her focus on addressing youth unemployment, while also offering special packages to keep crucial allies — the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) governing Andhra Pradesh, and the Janata Dal (U) in power in Bihar — on her side.

Rising unemployment, the lack of avenues to government jobs, and the leakage of question papers for recruitment exams even when vacancies were announced were all issues that weighed heavily on the BJP in the recent Lok Sabha election. In the Union Budget for this year, therefore, this sector has been addressed via a series of incentive schemes that will, it is hoped, help young, first-time job seekers with finding employment.

thehindu.com,"Budget 2024: New job schemes to kick off this year, says Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan","The government is confident of launching the schemes in the Prime Minister’s package for employment and skilling announced in last week’s Budget within this financial year. That includes the internship program for one crore youth in 500 top companies, whose design details will be worked out in consultation with the industry, Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan said.

“We expect all of these schemes to start off within this financial year… We have tried to make sure the coverage of the employment-linked incentive schemes is, as far as possible, widespread, and not tried to make technological, sectoral choices. While Scheme A and C are for all industries, Scheme B is for manufacturing jobs,” Mr. Somanathan told The Hindu.

High salary cut-off

The top Finance Ministry official also said that the decision to incentivise hiring for first-timers with a salary limit of ₹1 lakh per month was aimed at keeping the schemes sector-neutral. “I agree ₹1 lakh is high, but it’s not so if you’re trying to cover the hiring of people with sophisticated skills, or knowledge of AI [Artificial Intelligence],” he said, adding that the schemes could spur new jobs in areas under threat from the advent of technologies like AI.

Also read | ‘Capital gains is the fastest growing income class, can be taxed higher’

Referring to the recent tendency of large tech firms to defer joining dates for fresh recruits, the Secretary said that it was precisely for this reason that the government did not want to exclude such people. “We don’t want to leave out the services or any sector from possible incentivisation if it will create jobs. We don’t want to focus only on employees who draw up to ₹25,000 a month. You can pay the employee even one lakh, but our fiscal outgo is limited to the ₹25,000 level, but even 24% of that works out to 12% of a ₹50,000 salary, which is still a substantial subsidy,” he emphasised

“We don’t know where these salary figures stop. In some of these industries, even fresh hires get more than ₹50,000 to ₹60,000. But we have capped our outgo so the incentive is strongest for those earning ₹25,000,” the official noted.

‘Nothing to lose’

The new scheme to facilitate internships for youth in the age bracket of 21 to 24 years has no connection with the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0 announced in the Union Budget for 2023-24, and will be administered by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, not the Ministry of Skill Development, Mr. Somanathan underlined.

“While the Skill Development Ministry will be involved, this is very different,” he said, stressing that the scheme is voluntary and will not require firms to invest funds from their own pockets, but rather through their mandated corporate social responsibility (CSR) spends, combined with government resources.

“This particular scheme has not been discussed with industry chambers, but they have repeatedly said they are willing to collaborate on skilling because they see it as a national problem. We think many companies will respond positively. They have nothing to lose and everything to gain,” he averred, adding that firms are not expected to hire these interns.

Bridging the gap

“We are also open to the company doing the skilling through companies in the backward or forward supply chains, if they can’t do it themselves. We will work out the details. It’s an innovative approach and there will be design challenges. But I think we have to do something innovative to bridge the gap [between skill sets of the young and industry needs] and break this barrier,” Mr. Somanathan underlined.

The employment prospects of these interns will improve after their resumes, which previously said ‘no experience’, can add a year-long internship with a big company, Mr. Somanathan pointed out.

“This is a space where frankly, while everybody agrees that something is to be done, very few people have concrete ideas on what can the government do to promote employment. We are relying on basic micro economics, that a subsidy triggers additional expenditure in the item which is subsidised,” he summed up.

thehindu.com,Union Budget 2024: Real estate sees marginal benefits,"Covering a wide spectrum of Indian sectors, the first Union Budget of Modi 3.0 focused on MSMEs, employment, skilling, youth, and the middle class. Yet, the Budget as such has failed to address several concerns of the real estate sector, including direct incentives to boost the affordable housing sector. It was widely anticipated that affordable housing will get a major boost in the current Budget because its performance has been on a decline.

With an eye on the housing needs of the urban poor and the middle class, the government has announced that it intends to construct an additional one crore homes under PMAY Urban 2.0 with an outlay of ₹10 lakh crore. It remains to be seen how effectively this would work for the benefit of those in the affordable housing segment.

Mega allocation for the Hyderabad-Bengaluru industrial corridor and Vizag-Chennai corridor will boost growth along these corridors and consequently boost real estate growth there. The Finance Minister also tried to rejuvenate the MSME (Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) sector, which does have a multiplier effect on overall economic growth — with the implied positives for real estate being a collateral beneficiary of such growth.

The credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs will help provide impetus to overall industrial development, and this can have a rub-off effect on the real estate sector. The pandemic had a catastrophic impact on the MSME sector, which slowed down the demand for affordable housing from 2020. Affordable housing demand may gain momentum once the economic impact of the pandemic subsides for this target audience.

This is certainly pertinent — the affordable homes category (less than ₹40 lakh) has been seeing a decline in overall sales since the pandemic, to approximately 19% in H1 2024 from over 38% in the period before the pandemic in 2019. Consequently, this segment’s percentage share of the total housing supply in the top 7 cities also fell to 18% in H1 2024 from nearly 40% in 2019. Any boost to this vital segment is therefore welcome.

For individual taxpayers under the new tax regime, the increased standard deduction limit to ₹75,000 from the previous ₹50,000 along with the new income tax slabs implies savings, but hardly enough to boost housing demand.

With regards to the withdrawal of indexation benefits announced in the Budget, factors such as the amount of appreciation will determine whether the new tax (minus indexation) will be advantageous or disadvantageous for sellers. It is best to consult a tax expert for this, but as it seems now, when the difference between the purchase price and the sale price (in a 10-year period) is higher (say, more than 2-2.5 times), then the new tax regime without indexation is more lucrative for the buyers.

However, when the difference between the purchase price and sale price is lower, then the old tax regime with indexation is more lucrative for the buyers.

Selvaperunthagai on Friday, July 26, 2024 announced his party will stage a demonstration on Saturday condemning the Union government for allegedly ignoring Tamil Nadu in the Union Budget 2024.

In a statement, Mr. Selvaperunthagai alleged that the BJP was not able to tolerate rejections by people of Tamil Nadu in 2019, 2021 and 2024 elections. “Instead of serving the whole country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been showing discrimination in allocation of funds to States ruled by the INDIA bloc, including Tamil Nadu. Mr. Modi had allocated more funds to a few States, only to save his government.”

The Congress leader, in his statement, listed several projects proposed in Tamil Nadu including All India Institute of Medical Science at Madurai, Metro rail projects in Coimbatore and Madurai, and said the progress of these projects were halted for political reasons. He also alleged that the Centre had released only ₹276 crore for flood relief against ₹37,000 crore demanded by the State government.

thehindu.com,"‘Budget 2024-25 transformative, forward looking’","Industry leaders and representatives have termed the Union Budget presented by Finance Nirmala Sitharaman “transformative and forward looking due to its emphasis on capacity building and boosting agricultural production.”

Neeraj Akhoury, President, Cement Manufacturers’ Association (CMA) and Managing Director, Shree Cement Ltd. said, “Against the backdrop of global uncertainties and inflation, the Union Budget 2024-25 is transformative and forward looking with an eye on fiscal consolidation.”

“The announcement of ₹11 lakh crore capital expenditure signifies the Government’s commitment to modernising India’s infrastructure through various significant projects and allocations, which will undoubtedly drive demand for cement and other building materials,” he added.

Abhinandan Lodha, Chairman, The House of Abhinandan Lodha said, “The 2024-2025 Budget is a growth-centric blueprint with profound implications on employment and employability through real estate, infrastructure, and tourism.”

“This Budget marks a significant shift towards holistic growth, focusing on affordable housing. The allocation of ₹2.2 lakh crore for constructing one crore houses in urban areas and two crore houses in non-urban areas demonstrates the government’s commitment to improving living standards,” he added.

Arun Alagappan, Executive Chairman, Coromandel International Ltd., said, “With agriculture remaining the backbone of the Indian economy, we welcome the Union Budget’s emphasis on ensuring food security, strengthening rural economy, as well as building resilience and productivity in agriculture.”

“The proposed comprehensive review of the agricultural research setup to focus on improving productivity and developing climate resilient crops will lend an impetus to ensuring that Indian agriculture can withstand climate impact. The initiative to bring together experts from both the government and the private sector will lend a much-needed fillip to the R&D in the agri sector,” he added.

N. Venu, MD & CEO, India and South Asia, Hitachi Energy said, “The Union Budget presented by the Finance Minister took a strategic middle path and democratised growth for the people through modernising agriculture, jobs in manufacturing, urban development, energy access and energy security.”

“The proposed bill did not single out any specific industry, instead the thrust was on job creation. It focused on the employee-employer experience from incentivising integration of new, young and diverse people into the workforce to using private sector as partners for skilling of future talent,” he added.

N.D. Mali, Founder, KDM in a statement said, “Tax reduction of up to 15% on mobile phones, mobile PCBs, and chargers is expected to boost domestic manufacturing and benefit customers. The Budget focus on employment, skilling and middle class will spur consumer spending, which, in turn, would stimulate economic growth.”

“The fiscal prudence of 4.9% and increased outlay of capex will put more money in the hands of people and general consumer sentiment will increase. The Budget will further charge the economy of Bharat,” he added.

Sanjay Salunkhe, CMD, Jaro Education said “The Budget has struck the right balance to enhance the education and employment sector. The Finance Minister’s financial support for loans up to ₹10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions is a commendable initiative.”

“This will provide ample opportunities for upskilling the youth and budget emphasis on education, skilling, and job creation will foster long-term growth for corporates like us who have been striving to make youth of the country employable,” he added.",Left,Center Right,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget-2024-25-transformative-forward-looking/article68446846.ece
thehindu.com,Budget 2024 Analysis: A look at the sector-wise allocations in ten charts,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Tuesday, presented the first Union Budget of the third term of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. The Hindu Data team has compiled a series of graphs to analyse the impact of the Budget on select sectors and schemes.

Data shows that expenditure as a share of the total budget on infrastructure has increased. In contrast, expenditure on major schemes in the social sectors, which includes education, pension and health, have either stagnated or declined. Spending on agriculture too, when considered as a share of the total budget, has stagnated.

Before delving into individual sectors and schemes, the graph below provides an overview.

The graph below depicts the budgeted expenditure (Rs crore) for FY25BE and the change from FY24RE in percentage points. The bigger the rectangle, the higher the allocation for a sector. The deeper the blue, the higher the increase compared with FY24RE. The deeper the red, the higher the decrease compared with FY24RE.

As usual, interest payments garnered a lion’s share of the budget this year. In absolute figures, Rs 11,62,940 crore was allocated for interest payments. If expressed as a share of FY25BE’s total Budget, it comes to 24.12%, which is 0.62 percentage points more than its share in FY24RE. Apart from interest payments, the transport sector formed the bulk of the expenditure in FY25BE at 11.29%. However, transport’s share in the total Budget came down by 0.4% points from last year.

The allocation to agriculture remained stagnant at around 3.1% of the total budget. Allocation to flagship schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PMKSN), as a share of total budget, declined in FY25BE.

Defence expenditure as a share of the total Budget declined to 9.43%, the lowest in at least nine years. In fact, defence expenditure in absolute terms has also declined. Allocations to the departments of Space have stagnated, while the Science and Technology ministry’s share in total Budget has improved slightly to 0.17%.

Allocations to all the schemes under the Space sector, as a share of total budget, have stagnated.

Allocations for various social sectors such as health, rural development and education as a share of the total budget have stagnated or declined, with the social welfare sector being the only exception – whose share improved to 1.17% of the total budget in FY25BE.

Outlays to schemes under social sectors such as MGNREGA, Samagra Shiksha, Ayushman Bharat, old age pension, widow pension, Swasthya Suraksha, have all declined in the recent years. Allocation to Ayushman Bharat has remained more or less the same in recent years after a sharp increase seen in FY23.

The Transport sector on the other hand has formed a bulk of this year’s expenditure. Allocation to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) and the telecom department has remained consistently high. Allocations to the power sector too have improved marginally from last year.

While the outlays to implement housing in urban & rural areas, and other basic amenities in urban areas improved marginally in FY25BE, allocations to smart city missions, as a share of the total Budget, has plunged.

In FY25BE, the Railway Ministry outlay in the overall budget continued to be over the 5% mark. Allocations for the signalling and telecom works, under which KAVACH (automatic train collision system for trains) is included, increased compared with FY24RE

However, allocations for the Aviation Ministry which has remained consistently low in recent years declined marginally. The outlay for the Shipping Ministry has also stagnated.

ndtv.com,"""No State Has Been Denied Anything"": Nirmala Sitharaman Defends Budget 2024","No state has been denied anything in the 2024 Union Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told NDTV Friday evening, responding to opposition criticism that her speech this week mentioned only two states - Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, both ruled by key BJP allies.

Ms Sitharaman, who presented a record-setting seventh consecutive budget on Tuesday, said the centre had been required by law to support Andhra Pradesh after its bifurcation in 2014.

""States are receiving allocations as they have in the past... no state has been denied anything. The Act (Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act) requires the centre to support (the state) in building its capital city and developing backward regions,"" she explained.

""Several steps have been taken in the last 10 years (and) many other steps, as per the Act, which had to be done have been done. Yes, we will support (the building of the new capital, Amaravati, and the Polavaram irrigation project) ... Polavaram should have been completed but there are some technical issues. The state government is seized of the matter,"" Ms Sitharaman told said.

The Congress-led INDIA bloc had criticised the Modi 3.0 government for failing to provide schemes or even mention states not ruled by the BJP or its allies. The chief ministers of three Congress-ruled states - Siddaramaiah (Karnataka), Revanth Reddy (Telangana), and Sukhvinder Sukhu (Himachal Pradesh) - said they would boycott a Niti Aayog meeting Saturday in protest.

The meeting is being chaired by Mr Modi.

Apart from the Congress, Tamil Nadu's ruling DMK, also an INDIA bloc member, said no provision has been made for infrastructure projects like the second phase of the Chennai Metro Rail and similar developments in Coimbatore.

On Wednesday Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin, also expected to boycott the meeting, offered a warning to Mr Modi. ""The election is over... now we have to think about the country. Budget 2024 will save your rule... but will not save the nation. Run the government objectively... otherwise you will be isolated,"" he said on X.

The Finance Minister hit back on Wednesday, telling the opposition no budget could name every state in the union and that not mentioning them did not mean no funds would be given.

Responding particularly to criticism by Congress boss Mallikarjun Kharge, she said, ""To the point he raised - that I have not named many states and spoke only about two. The Congress was in power for a long time. They presented many budgets and should know that in every budget, you don't get an opportunity to name every state of this country.""

Ms Sitharaman also said the budget reflected Prime Minister Narendra Modi's wish to keep things simple, so everyone, and not just subject experts, could understand India's finances.

""We present everything upfront. There is no fine print... we ensure that any changes made are communicated openly, based on feedback and transparent processes,"" she said.",Left,Center-Right,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/no-state-has-been-denied-anything-nirmala-sitharaman-defends-budget-2024-6194796

Let’s have a look at why these states have been given special flood relief aid in Budget 2024:

Bihar

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her speech said that Rs 11,500 crore would be allocated for flood control efforts in Bihar. Floods have often befallen the state, with many of them coming from outside the nation. She further added that there are currently no plans in place to construct flood control structures in Nepal.

In addition to this, she said that a survey and inquiry into flood control and irrigation projects relating to Kosi will be conducted.

Assam

Due to the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries originating outside of India, Assam experiences floods every year. During the budget speech, Sitharaman stated that assistance to Assam for flood management and related projects will be provided.

Sikkim

In her Budget 2024 announcement, FM Sitharaman expressed her desire to aid in the state’s reconstruction following the catastrophic Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). Devastating landslides and flash floods have struck Sikkim, causing havoc throughout the state.

Uttarakhand

Funds to support the state will be provided as announced during the presentation of the Union Budget speech due to massive landslides and cloudbursts causing losses in the state.

Himachal Pradesh

Floods last year caused significant damages in Himachal Pradesh.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024-25: A roadmap for inclusive growth,"By Pawan Munjal

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi embarks on his third consecutive term, he reaffirms his commitment to continuity and stability. The inaugural Union Budget of the Modi 3.0 government, presented by our finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, epitomises this promise. This Budget reinforces India’s ambitious journey towards becoming Viksit Bharat—a developed nation.

In this Amrit Kaal, India stands on a strong and robust economic growth trajectory, with a projected GDP growth of ~6.5-7% for the current fiscal year. Despite global economic adversities, India has successfully shielded itself from adverse impacts. Budget 2024 is meticulously designed to address key areas crucial for propelling India to the next echelon of growth.

To advance India’s growth, Budget 2024 focuses on crucial areas: women-led development, advanced skilling, job creation, rural empowerment, energy sector transformation, and ease of doing business. This Budget not only addresses these pivotal areas but also establishes a solid foundation to sustain the government’s growth trajectory for the next five years. Such strategic alignment ensures a comprehensive and inclusive framework, positioning India for continued ascendancy on the global stage.

India’s youthful demographic provides a significant advantage in addressing the global skill gap. The employment-linked incentive scheme, initiated by the finance minister, is a decisive step in this direction, aiming to benefit 20 lakh youth over the next five years. Additionally, upgrading 1,000 industrial training institutes will catalyse the creation of skilled workforce, aligning with the industry demands.

Prime Minister Modi’s unwavering belief in the power of nari shakti (women power) is evident in Budget 2024’s emphasis on enhancing women’s participation in the workforce. The announcement of establishing hostels and forming partnerships to conduct women-specific skilling programmes is not only praiseworthy, but also underscores the government’s commitment to all-encompassing, inclusive development.

India’s commitment to green energy has reached a pivotal juncture. The Budget extends its energy security initiatives by introducing a policy document on energy transition pathways that harmonises employment, growth, and environmental sustainability imperatives.

The government’s commitment to bolstering rural development is evident in the substantial budget allocation for capital expenditure, aimed at strengthening infrastructure and enhancing connectivity in rural areas. These connectivity projects will facilitate greater accessibility and mobility within rural communities, fostering inclusive growth.

The announcement of releasing 109 high-yielding, resilient, and climate-adaptive varieties of 32 field and horticultural crops coupled with the plan to initiate one crore farmers into natural farming holds the potential to boost agricultural sector growth, advancing India’s journey towards becoming aatmanirbhar (self-reliant).

Recognising micro, small and medium Enterprises (MSMEs) as the backbone of our nation, it is encouraging to see an increase in the Mudra loan limit from `10 lakh to `20 lakh. This move will ensure enhanced capital availability, drive innovation, and spur employment generation opportunities.

Budget 2024 reflects India’s steadfast commitment to inclusive and sustainable growth. By prioritising advanced skilling, robust employment initiatives, green energy transformation, and comprehensive support to MSMEs, this Budget lays the foundation for a resilient and innovative future. These decisive measures will not only address current challenges, but also create employment opportunities, driving the nation towards unparalleled prosperity. With this visionary blueprint, India is set to emerge stronger, more self-reliant, and ready to lead on the global stage.

Chadha remarked that the BJP’s failure to secure a majority in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, with only 240 seats, was a result of the public imposing an “18% GST” on the government.

Participating in the budget debate, Chadha said, “In 2019, the BJP had 303 seats in Lok Sabha, but in 2024, the public imposed 18% GST and gave them only 240 seats. The main reasons for their plight are economic failures.” He illustrated this by explaining the tax burden on a common man: “If a person earns Rs 10, they pay Rs 3 in income tax, Rs 2-2.50 in GST, Rs 2 in capital gains tax, and Rs 1-1.50 in other charges, leaving them with only Rs 2-3. Despite this heavy taxation, what does the common man gain? We pay taxes like England but get services like Somalia.”

In his speech, Chadha offered an analysis of why the BJP lost seats in the elections and provided suggestions to the government. He emphasised that economic issues, particularly rural income and inflation, food inflation and unemployment, were the primary reasons for the BJP’s defeat.

He highlighted that rural income growth is at a decadal low, food inflation is around 9% and unemployment rates are alarmingly high in both organised and unorganised sectors.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: How removal of indexation benefits impacts property tax – Comparison of pre-2001 and post-2001 purchases,"In the Union Budget 2024, the removal of the indexation benefit on property transactions has led to significant changes in the calculation of long-term capital gains (LTCG). However, the government has clarified that the indexation benefit will remain available for properties bought or inherited before 2001, even though the LTCG tax rate has been reduced from 20% to 12.5%.

As the government has clarified that properties bought before 2001 will still get indexation benefits on sale, here is an illustration taking two scenarios – pre-2001 purchase and post-2001 property purchase.

Scenario 1: Property Bought in 1999

For property bought before 2001, the indexation benefit is available, as per new changes in the LTCG structure.

Calculation of Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) with Indexation

Let’s assume the Cost Inflation Index (CII) for the year of sale (2024) is 348 and for the year 1999 is 100.

Indexed cost of acquisition = Purchase value * (CII for 2024 / CII for 1999)

Indexed cost of acquisition = ₹10,00,000 * (348 / 100) = ₹34,80,000

LTCG Calculation:

LTCG = Current property value – Indexed cost of acquisition

LTCG = ₹1,00,00,000 – ₹34,80,000 = ₹65,20,000

Tax Calculation:

Tax rate = 12.5%

Tax = 12.5% of ₹65,20,000 = ₹8,15,000

Long-Term Capital Gains Tax payable: ₹8,15,000

Scenario 2: Property Bought in 2003

Calculation of Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) without Indexation

For property bought after 2001, the indexation benefit is not available.

Cost of acquisition = ₹10,00,000

LTCG Calculation:

LTCG = Current property value – Cost of acquisition

LTCG = ₹1,00,00,000 – ₹10,00,000 = ₹90,00,000

Tax Calculation:

Tax rate = 12.5%

Tax = 12.5% of ₹90,00,000 = ₹11,25,000

Long-Term Capital Gains payable: ₹11,25,500

To summarise the both scenarios, the tax payable on the sale of a property bought in 1999, benefiting from indexation, is ₹8,15,000. The tax payable on the sale of a property bought in 2003, without indexation, is ₹11,25,000.

Justifying the indexation removal move, meanwhile, the Income Tax Department in one of the posts on social media handle ‘X’ said, “Nominal real estate returns are generally in the region of 12-16 per cent per annum, much higher than inflation. The indexation for inflation is in the region of 4-5 per cent, depending on the period of holding. Therefore, substantial tax savings are expected to a vast majority of such tax payers.”",Center,Center,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/budget-2024-how-removal-of-indexation-benefits-impacts-property-tax-comparison-of-pre-2001-and-post-2001-purchases-3564909/

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Hemant Soren accuses Centre of neglecting Jharkhand,"The Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren slammed the Centre for neglecting the State in the Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party leaders are silent over the dues from the Centre. He also claimed that the Centre owes ₹1.36 lakh crore to the State and demanded that its dues be paid by the Union government.

Reacting on the 2024 Budget, Mr. Soren said on X (formerly Twitter) account, “Is Hemant Soren guilty of this discrimination, Babulal Marandi ji? Centre owes us ₹1.36 thousand crore but every BJP leader including Babulal ji is silent on this issue. Give a special package to the political parties that support you and pay our dues. Raghubar Das had left behind DVC’s dues of ₹5,000 crore - which the Centre had deducted from our account without informing us and BJP leaders were clapping. Why are we being neglected despite giving 12 out of 14 MPs in 2014 -2019 and today 9 MP.”

In charts: Key takeaways from Union Budget 2024-25

He also made an indirect attack on the Narendra Modi government for giving special packages to Bihar and Andhra Pradesh because Nitish Kumar led Janata Dal-(United) and Chandrababu Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party (TDP) are the key alliance partners supporting the government at Centre.

Mr. Soren further said, “Jharkhand BJP has maintained silence on the friendly Budget presented yesterday. No leader is ready to say anything and secretly admitting that nothing could be worse than this. They are also angry that Jharkhand did not get anything but not ready to say anything due to fear. The people of Jharkhand have neither any expectation nor any hope of getting their rights from such cowardly/sycophantic leaders. Jharkhand always gave the maximum number of MPs to BJP but in return we got only disrespect. Note - After this tweet, maybe their self-esteem will rise and they will show the strength to say something, but the whole expectation is of flattery only.”

Announcing a host of developmental projects in the Union Budget, Ms. Sitharaman proposed a total outlay of ₹58,900 crore for various projects in Bihar, where Assembly elections are due next year, and ₹15,000 crore for the 2024-25 fiscal for the development of Andhra Pradesh’s capital city, a dream project of Mr. Naidu.

Asked about the allegation levelled by Mr. Soren, Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Pratul Sahdev described the budget as inclusive and taking care of all sections.

He said that Jharkhand will directly benefit from the road map for the development of the Purvodaya Yojana and eastern India will also catch the pace of development like the rest of the country.

“With the continuation of funding of the Aspirational District Scheme, 19 districts of Jharkhand will continue to receive central funds directly. The development of tribal-dominated Jharkhand will accelerate with the start of the Tribal Advanced Village Scheme. Apart from this, Jharkhand will definitely get a share of all the schemes of the Centre. Mudra loan has so far helped in providing self-employment to more than 30 crore people. By increasing its limit to ₹20 lakh, small businessmen and those starting a new business will get a big benefit,” Mr. Sahdev told The Hindu.",Left,Left,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-cm-hemant-soren-slams-bjp-led-centre-for-neglecting-jharkhand/article68440268.ece
financialexpress.com,What is indexation in property sale and how is it calculated? What has changed after Budget 2024?,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in Budget 2024, announced the scrapping of indexation benefits on property sales, prompting real estate experts to call the move “negative” for the sector from an investment perspective. However, the government has attempted to offset this by lowering the long-term capital gains tax to 12.5% on the sale of property and other financial and non-financial assets. Before moving further, let’s understand what indexation is and how it is calculated on the sale of various assets, including real estate assets held over a certain period.

In case of property sale, indexation helps in adjusting its purchase price according to the prevailing inflation rate. So basically the adjustment inflates the purchase price of a property considering the inflation over the invested years, which ultimately brings down the taxable capital gains on the sale of the property. The government releases cost inflation index (CII) numbers to index capital gains on specified assets. CII number takes into account the prevailing inflation for the particular financial year.

New tax regime offers relief for low to middle-income earners, but high-income taxpayers still better off under old regime Amul named the world’s strongest food brand

Through indexation, investors can accurately determine their capital gains and be assured that they are paying taxes only on the real gains after inflation is adjusted.

How is Indexation Calculated?

Let’s break down an example to see how indexation worked under the previous tax rules:

Purchase Price of Property: ₹50 lakh

Adjusted Purchase Price (Indexed): ₹64.82 lakh

Sale Price (2024-25): ₹70 lakh

Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG): ₹5.18 lakh

LTCG Tax Liability: ₹1.036 lakh (20% of Gain)

Under New Tax Rules – No Indexation Allowed

Now, let’s see how the calculations look under the new tax rules, where indexation is not allowed:

Purchase Price of Property: ₹50 lakh

Sale Price (2024-25): ₹70 lakh

Gain: ₹20 lakh

LTCG Tax Liability: ₹2.5 lakh (12.5% of Gain)

Remember, the purchase price of the asset is adjusted by the cost inflation index (CII). This helps in accounting for inflation over the period of holding the asset.

Formula to calculate the adjusted purchase price using the cost inflation index is: Cost Inflation Index (CII) = Sales Amount – (Purchase Amount * (Index in year of sale / Index in year of purchase))

This adjustment ensures that the taxable gain reflects the real increase in the asset’s value, not just the effect of inflation.

Changes in the Union Budget 2024 regarding indexation benefits

In the Union Budget 2024, the Centre has lowered the tax rates on capital gains from the sale of long-held real estate properties but has scrapped the indexation benefit. The LTCG tax rate has been reduced from 20% with indexation to 12.5% without indexation on sale of property.

The indexation benefit, however, can be taken on the sale of property bought or inherited before 2001, which means if someone sells now an old property bought before 2001, he or she will have to pay an LTCG rate of 12.5% without this ‘inflation adjustment’ benefit.

Many experts see this removal of indexation for long-term capital gains (LTCG) on property deals in the Budget a significant blow to property owners selling their ancestral properties.

“The Budget move on change in taxation, effective from July 23, 2024, replaces the 20% LTCG rate with indexation to a flat 12.5% without indexation. This translates to a potentially higher tax burden, often amounting to lakhs of rupees, for those looking to sell older properties,” says KS Roy, a personal finance expert.

The removal of the indexation benefit could have three major consequences.

1. Slowdown in the resale market: It may discourage owners of older residential properties and land from selling, as the increased tax liability reduces their potential profit.

2. Rise in cash transactions: There’s a concern that this change could incentivize under-the-table cash deals to avoid the higher tax burden, counteracting efforts to formalize the real estate sector.

3. Higher property prices: Sellers may attempt to offset the increased tax burden by raising property prices, effectively transferring the cost to buyers.",Center,Center,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/what-is-indexation-in-property-sale-and-how-is-it-calculated-what-has-changed-after-budget-2024-3564188/

However, it is not immediately known for which key projects the funds have been allocated by the Railways. The interim Budget last February has earmarked ₹2,744 crore, seven times higher than the average outlay of ₹372 crore made by the second United Progressive Alliance government in the 2009-2014 period.

Among the various works, line doubling received a major thrust with the interim Budget setting aside around ₹1,072.5 crore. A sum of ₹105 crore was set aside for Ernakulam–Kumbalam (7.71 km) doubling works followed by ₹102.50 crore for Kumbalam–Turavur (15.59 km) patch doubling, ₹500 crore for Turavur–Ambalappuzha (50 km) track doubling, and ₹365 crore for Thiruvananthapuram–Kanyakumari (86.56 km) track doubling. The interim Budget had also earmarked ₹100 crore for the Angamaly–Sabarimala Sabari rail project.

It is expected that all these projects will be given priority while allocating funds in the new Budget. Speaking to mediapersons, Mr. Vaishnav said in Kerala, in the last 10 years, the daily average electrification of rail lines increased to 49 km compared to 10 km during 2009-14.

A total of 106 rail overbridges and under-bridges had been constructed in the State since 2014 and 35 railway stations, including Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Kollam, Guruvayur, Thrissur, Punalur, Chalakudy, Kozhikode and Alappuzha, would be upgraded as Amrita Bharat Railway Stations.

Manish Thaplyal, Divisional Railway Manager, said the division had achieved a speed increase of 20% for freight trains, an increase in passenger earnings by 12%, and was making rapid progress in the redevelopment of 15 stations under Amrit Station scheme.

ndtv.com,Budget 2024: A Progressive Blueprint for Inclusive Growth And Development,"The first Union Budget of Modi 3.0, presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is a nuanced mix of policy consistency, fiscal prudence, and a refreshing and zealous job push. In the last few years, the budgets of the Modi government have followed a pattern: heavy capital expenditure and high welfare spending, while keeping growth targets robust and the fiscal deficit in check. The latest budget has retained all those elements while expanding into newer zones. The biggest beneficiary of this budget is the youth, with an unprecedented push to create skills and job opportunities.

Empowering Youth

Empowering the youth and fulfilling their dreams is at the heart of the Modi government. The Budget for Viksit Bharat continues the government's trend of placing the aspirations of the youth at the centre of policymaking. With the Prime Minister's package of five schemes and initiatives for employment and skilling with an outlay of Rs 2 lakh crore for our 4.1 crore youth, the budget demonstrates a clear commitment to building a future-ready workforce. The government's emphasis on education, employment, and skilling underscores a forward-looking approach that aligns with the goals of Viksit Bharat. By investing in the youth, the government is not only addressing immediate needs but also building the foundation for a prosperous and resilient future. This budget reflects a visionary roadmap that leverages the potential of the young population to drive national growth and development.

Economic Stability Amid Global Uncertainties

Despite global economic uncertainties, including elevated asset prices, political instability, and shipping disruptions, India's economic growth remains a beacon of stability. India's inflation remains low and stable, moving towards the 4% target, with core inflation (non-food, non-fuel) currently at 3.1%. Proactive government steps to ensure adequate market supplies of perishable goods have contributed significantly to this stability.

Inclusivity at the Heart of the Budget

The Modi government has placed a strong emphasis on inclusive growth, focusing on four major segments of society: 'Garib' (poor), 'Mahilayen' (women), 'Yuva' (youth), and 'Annadata' (farmers). Administrative actions for the approval and implementation of various schemes announced in the interim budget are well underway, with necessary allocations made to ensure their success.

Transforming Agriculture and Rural Development

Agriculture and rural development are pivotal areas in this budget. An allocation of ₹1.52 lakh crore has been made for agriculture and related sectors. Agricultural production and productivity are prioritised, with 109 varieties of 32 high-yielding and climate-resilient crops set for release. Agricultural research will be comprehensively reviewed to emphasise the development of climate-friendly crops. Mission-mode production, storage, and marketing of crops like pulses and oilseeds will be strengthened.

To increase productivity and reduce input costs, one million farmers will be linked to natural farming in the next two years. Natural farming will also positively impact the health of the earth, the health of the common people, and the climate. To ensure fair prices for farmers, MSP rates are being continuously increased, with at least 50% profit on the cost being added to MSP.

Empowering Women and Tribals

The budget sets a target to make 3 crore Lakhpati Didi, bringing revolutionary changes in the lives of women. An allocation of ₹2.66 lakh crore has been made for rural development, including rural infrastructure. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, 3 crore houses will be built, both in rural and urban areas.

For women and girls, ₹3 lakh crore has been allocated for various schemes. PM Janjati Unnat Gramme Abhiyan is a new scheme targeting tribal-majority areas and aspirational districts, aiming to benefit 5 crore tribal people in 63,000 villages. Steps will be taken for complete coverage of tribal families in aspirational districts and tribal-dominated villages to improve their socio-economic condition.

Fostering Small Businesses and Eastern Region Development

The government will step up the implementation of schemes supporting economic activities by craftsmen, artisans, self-help groups, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, women entrepreneurs, and street vendors, such as PM Vishwakarma, PM SVANidhi, National Livelihood Missions, and Stand-Up India. The Purvodaya plan will foster the all-round development of the eastern region, covering Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh, making the region an engine to attain Viksit Bharat.

Supporting MSMEs and Infrastructure Development

The budget gives special attention to MSMEs and manufacturing, particularly labour-intensive manufacturing. A self-financing guarantee fund will provide each applicant with a guarantee covering up to ₹100 crore. Significant investment in infrastructure has had a strong multiplier effect on the economy. The government will maintain strong fiscal support for infrastructure over the next five years, with ₹11,11,111 crore allocated for capital expenditure, which is 3.4% of our GDP.

Boosting Start-ups

To bolster the Indian start-up ecosystem and boost the entrepreneurial spirit, angel tax for all classes of investors has been abolished. Social security benefits have also been improved, with the deduction of expenditure by employers towards NPS proposed to be increased from 10% to 14% of the employee's salary.

Simplifying the New Tax Regime

The new tax regime has been simplified with significant changes that benefit both salaried employees and pensioners. The standard deduction for salaried employees has been increased from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000, offering greater relief and boosting disposable income. Additionally, the deduction on family pensions for pensioners has been increased from ₹15,000 to ₹25,000, providing more financial support for retirees. These measures ensure more money in the hands of the common people, making the tax system more equitable and supportive of all segments of society.

In all, the Modi government has presented a comprehensive, all-encompassing, and inclusive budget embodying social justice. This budget provides a roadmap for India in 2047, moving the Indian economy towards a golden future. In just 10 years since 2014, India has become the fifth-largest economy in the world and is on the path to becoming the third-largest.

The Union Budget 2024-25 underscores the Modi government's commitment to inclusive and sustainable growth. By balancing high capital expenditure with robust welfare spending, the government is paving the way for a resilient and thriving economy. The focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class, combined with initiatives for rural development and support for start-ups, positions India for continued economic growth and development. The government's vision for a Viksit Bharat (developed India) is clear, and this budget is a significant step towards realising that dream.

thehindu.com,Union Budget 2024: Nirmala Sitharaman scraps Angel Tax on foreign investments amid startup funding winter,"In a major respite for India’s fledgling startups, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, presenting the Union Budget in Parliament on July 23, announced scrapping the contentious Angel Tax on foreign investments received by such enterprises, a development that should ease the financing woes of startups, following what they call a funding winter in the past year.

Follow LIVE updates from The Hindu’s coverage of the Union Budget 2024

Ms. Sitharaman introduced the measure stating that it would help “bolster the Indian start-up ecosystem, boost the entrepreneurial spirit and support innovation”.

The tax was introduced during the UPA government while outlining measures the NDA government took to ease the growth of startups, she said in a press briefing on July 23 afternoon. While answering queries about the possibilities of money laundering due to the abolition, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said “there are other provisions in the Income Tax (Act) itself to find out the source of these funds” and that the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) continued to be in existence. The existent laws were sufficient to cater to it, Mr. Malhotra added.

“We hope that even some of the past investments which are not already under dispute will probably have a little more benign outlook from the tax department,” Ashish Aggarwal, Vice President & Head of Public Policy at NASSCOM, told The Hindu.

“This new development will lead to a cessation of fresh litigation. Furthermore, funds that would have been tied up in deposits for cases involving notice issuance cease” said Brijesh Damodaran, Partner at Auxano Capital.

The abolition of angel tax assumes significance as it comes at a time when startups funding dropped 60% in 2023 to $10 Billion, according to data in the Indian Tech Startup Funding Report 2023, from Inc42, a private startup media and information platform. The decline is more than 40% in 2022.

The tax was opposed by several industry players as they believed it curbed foreign investment and deterred the growth of startups. Angel tax was originally introduced in 2012 to curb possible money laundering by foreign participants, by investing in overvalued unlisted firms. The unintended consequences were faced by startups, for which investments are made based on the potential value of the business, unlike in regular firms which are valued on their current worth. This imposed tax liabilities in the incubation and early funding stages of startups, deterring their growth.

“This decision is a welcome step towards providing tax certainty, preventing unintended consequences on foreign investments, and supporting startups” said Rahul Charkha, Partner at a legal firm Economic Laws Practice.

Despite opposition from various stakeholders, including the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), the government held on to levying angel tax. Moreover, the income tax rules amendments in September 2023 included changes in calculating fair market value of shares and a threshold for considering a share as “overvalued” among others. One of the main intentions of the amendment was to bring in parity between domestic and foreign investors.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2024-nirmala-sitharaman-scraps-angel-tax-on-foreign-investments-amid-startup-funding-winter/article68437487.ece

ndtv.com,Union Budget 2024: Angel Tax For All Classes Of Investors To Be Abolished,"Representational Image

In a bid to bolster the Indian startup ecosystem, the Centre today announced the abolishment of angel tax for all classes of investors.

Angel tax is levied on the capital raised via the issue of shares by unlisted companies from an Indian investor if the share price of issued shares is seen in excess of the fair market value of the company. The excess realization is considered as income and is taxed accordingly.

""To bolster the Indian startup ecosystem, boost the entrepreneurial spirit, and support innovation, I propose to abolish the so-called angel tax for all classes of investors,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her Union Budget 2024 speech.

She also announced various changes with respect to tax rates for e-commerce players and certain financial instruments in the context of long-term capital gains.

Long-term gains on financial and non-financial assets will attract a tax rate of 12.5 per cent, she said, while the TDS rate will be reduced to 0.1 per cent from 1 per cent for e-commerce operators.

New Tax Regime Slabs Changed

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also said the standard deduction in the new tax regime will be increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000.

She also announced revisions to tax slabs in the new regime in her Budget speech.

The revised slabs are as follows:

Income up to Rs 3 lakh - Nil

Rs 3 lakh to Rs 7 lakh - 5 per cent

Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh - 10 per cent

Rs 10 lakh to Rs 12 lakh - 15 per cent

Rs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh - 20 per cent

Above Rs 15 lakh - 30 per cent

As a result, Ms Sitharaman said, salaried employees can save as much as Rs 17,500 in the new regime. There will be no change in the old tax slabs, she said.",Left,nan,https://www.ndtv.com/business-news/budget-angel-tax-for-all-classes-of-investors-to-be-abolished-6168144
ndtv.com,Union Budget 2024: What Is Gender Budgeting And How It Aims To Allocate Public Resources,"Gender budgeting aims to allocate resources in a way that promotes gender equality (Representational)

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 on Tuesday. The central government is expected to announce significant measures for the welfare and empowerment of women.

According to the Economic Survey 2023-2024, there has been a remarkable 218.8 per cent rise in the budget allocation for women's welfare from FY14 to FY25, reaching Rs 3.10 lakh crore. The Gender Budget Statement has risen by 38.7 per cent compared to FY24 BE, accounting for 6.5 per cent of the total Union Budget, the highest share since its introduction in FY06.

What is Gender Budgeting?

Gender budgeting is a strategy that includes gender considerations in the budgeting process. Its goal is to allocate public resources in a way that promotes gender equality and addresses the unique needs of different genders. It involves analysing and allocating budget resources in a way that addresses the specific needs and priorities of women and girls and promotes gender-sensitive policies and programs.

Emphasis on women-led development

The Economic Survey highlights the importance of women-led development, starting with the health and education of the girl child. Key indicators show progress in this area, with the national sex ratio at birth (SRB) improving from 918 to 930, and the maternal mortality rate decreasing from 130 to 97 per lakh live births.

Government initiatives

Mission Shakti is a women empowerment programme launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) for the period 2021-2025. It aims to strengthen interventions for women's welfare, safety, and empowerment, making women equal partners in nation-building.

Initiatives like Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram, and PM Matru Vandana Yojana have also contributed to significant improvements in the welfare and empowerment of women and girls. These programs have led to an increase in institutional deliveries, from 78.9 per cent to 88.6 per cent, and improved public health service utilisation and birth spacing.

The Mission Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 programmes focus on improving women's health beyond just calorie intake and improving overall health and immunity with proper micronutrients.

Education is a key to empowering women. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the Right to Education have made sure that boys and girls enroll in school equally. For the past five years, more women have been enrolled in higher education than men.

Women's participation in skill development has increased. Under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), it grew from 42.7 per cent in FY16 to 52.3 per cent in FY24. The Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme has 82 per cent female beneficiaries. Women's involvement in ITIs and NSTIs rose from 9.8 per cent in FY16 to 13.3 per cent in FY24, and in the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS), it went up from 7.7 per cent in FY17 to 20.8 per cent in FY24.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Fillip to clean energy schemes,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget address gave a fillip to several commitments made in the interim Budget in February to incentivise clean energy but stopped short of announcing new schemes.

The Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojna, which aims at providing subsidised rooftop solar installations to one crore households, has been allocated nearly ₹10,000 crore this year. This is more than twice the ₹4,970 crore that was spent, as part of the solar power (grid), last year.

Follow live updates from the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024

The scheme offers 300 units of free electricity and, as The Hindu reported, households interested in availing the scheme’s benefits will have to pay a minimum of ₹20,000 depending on the power capacity of the installed system though this could be defrayed by a low-interest, collateral-free loan.

Only houses with a suitable roof and an existing connection to the grid will be eligible for the scheme and consumers will still have to pay for all the net power supplied and consumed via the grid.

Ms. Sitharaman said the scheme has so far generated a “remarkable response” with more than 1.28 crore registrations and 14 lakh applications.

The Minister underlined investment in constructing small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), a proposal India has been considering for a few years. “Nuclear energy is expected to form a very significant part of the energy mix for Viksit (developed) Bharat. Towards that pursuit, our government will partner with the private sector for setting up Bharat Small Reactors, research and development of Bharat Small Modular Reactor, and research and development of newer technologies for nuclear energy. The R&D funding announced in the interim budget will be made available for this sector,” she said.

SMRs, as the name suggests, are compact versions of nuclear reactors and provide up to 300MW of power. In 2022, Atomic Energy Minister Jitendra Singh had said that these reactors, “less expensive and safer”, would be important to India’s energy security.

The Finance Minister also restated a proposal from 2018 to develop an advanced ultra supercritical (AUSC) thermal power plant via a collaboration involving the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL). However, no specific budgetary allocations were mentioned.

Supercritical plants vapourise water by heating it to a minimum of 300 degrees Celsius and pressurising it to 220 bars. This state, when used to run a turbine for electricity, burns coal more efficiently than in conventional plants. Ultra and advanced supercritical technology is a variation of this and while energy efficient, it requires sustained long-term investment.

In 2018, the government had officially announced that India’s first AUSC-based technology developed by the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research and manufactured by the BHEL for NTPC would be set up at the Sipat station in Chhattisgarh.

A policy for promoting pumped storage projects would be brought out for electricity storage and facilitating smooth integration of the growing share of renewable energy, the Ms. Sitharaman said. Pumped storage is a kind of hydroelectric power project in which water is stored at two different elevations, released and pumped back in a coordinated manner to run an electric turbine.

“This year’s budget has a lot in store for the energy sector. It is in line with the interim budget and with major investments in renewable energy will give a shot in the arm to clean energy companies. It underscores a move towards more holistic energy transition pathway, considering energy security, economic growth, employment generation, and environmental sustainability,” said Neshwin Rodrigues, electricity policy analyst, Ember-India, said in a statement. “India now needs to find ways to reduce reliance on thermal power and with battery costs expected to further fall sharply in the coming years, can plan phasing down this reliance,” he said.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-fillip-to-clean-energy-schemes/article68436882.ece

financialexpress.com,Agriculture Budget 2024 Highlights: Will government’s roadmap to ‘Vikshit Bharat’ by 2047 focus on agri sector?,"Agriculture Budget 2024 Speech Highlights: The Budget for 2024-25 is the first major economic document of the newly-formed government, aiming to pave the way for India to become a developed nation by 2047. Notably, upon returning for a third term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first action was signing the release of the 17th instalment of the PM Kisan Nidhi scheme. In its initial cabinet session, the NDA government also approved new Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 14 kharif crops for the 2024-25 marketing season. These strategic decisions highlight the crucial role of the farming sector in the Modi government’s vision of making India the third-largest economy. Experts predict that the upcoming budget, to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, will likely include populist measures to support farmers. The Economic Survey presented on Monday noted, “Indian agriculture is not in a crisis now but requires a serious structural transformation because climate change and water criticality loom large in the times to come.”

Ms. Sitharaman said that the budgetary allocation signalled the government’s commitment to enhancing women‘s role in economic development.

To encourage participation of women in the workforce, the government will tie up with industry to set up working women hostels as well as creche-facilities, she said. Further, this industry-government partnership is also expected to launch women-specific skilling programmes and promote market access to women-led SHG enterprises.

As far as social justice is concerned, the government proposes adopting a saturation approach to cover all eligible people through various schemes, including those for health and education. The end goal is to achieve inclusive human resource development, one of the core priorities of the Union Budget 2024-25.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Nirmala Sitharaman signals shift from earlier trickle-down strategy to a slew of schemes,"Presenting her seventh Union Budget and the first after this year’s Lok Sabha election, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23 unveiled a flurry of measures aimed at fixing the woes of unemployed youth, small businesses, and the middle class, and sought to strengthen the ruling NDA coalition’s bonds with support for multiple investment projects in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.

Ms. Sitharaman proposed income tax rate cuts worth up to ₹17,500 a year, putting an extra ₹1,458 a month in the hands of those earning upto ₹12 lakh a year, and hiked standard deductions for salaried taxpayers and pensioners by ₹25,000 and ₹10,000, respectively. She also promised to spend ₹2 lakh crore over five years on five schemes which are part of what she called “the Prime Minister’s package”, aimed at spurring jobs and imparting skills to 4.1 crore youth.

Changing lanes

This marked a shift in strategy, or rather a frenetic changing of lanes ahead of a roundabout as drivers in the capital are prone to do, from the previous government’s preferred reliance on letting multiplier and trickle-down effects work while avoiding direct handouts to such sections of society. A similar lane change was last seen when Ms. Sitharaman’s predecessor, the late Arun Jaitley, presented his third Budget, for 2016-17.

Seeking to shed the “suit-boot sarkar” label used by the Opposition at the time, Mr. Jaitley had dedicated that Budget to the farmers, the poor, and vulnerable sections of society and switched his focus to the rural economy and job creation. The trigger for the shift, this time, could be the BJP’s electoral reverses after a decade of outright majority in Parliament, preceded by revelations such as big businesses’ electoral bond purchases.

Jobs, jobs, jobs

At a briefing after her roughly-90 minute speech, which appeared to acknowledge and begin addressing the perceived disenchantment among specific voter groups like the young, the salaried class, farmers, and small entrepreneurs, Ms. Sitharaman made it clear that the overarching theme of Budget 2024-25 was ‘EMPLOYMENT’. Used as an acronym, the theme was spelt out — Employment and Education; Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); Productivity; Land; Opportunities; Youth; Middle Class; Energy Security; New Generation Reforms; and Technology.

Her speech referred to ‘employment’ 23 times, up sharply from three mentions of the word in the 2023-24 Budget, and seven (four of which were about past achievements rather than the future) in the Interim Budget presented this February. ‘Jobs’ featured four times in relation to new schemes, compared with just one mention in the pre-poll Interim Budget. Similarly, there were three references to the middle-class, from just one mention in the Interim Budget and two in 2023-24.

Shift in priorities

References to growth slipped to 10, from a combined 34 mentions in the last two Budget speeches. Mr. Jaitley’s third Budget had also slashed growth references, but the similarities with that speech don’t end there. While he had released a plan to ‘Transform India’ based on action points around nine pillars, Ms. Sitharaman on Tuesday laid out nine priorities for generating ample opportunities for all. Five of those are, in fact, similar to Mr. Jaitley’s list that led with the promise to double farmers’ incomes in five years. Ms. Sitharaman said that her first priority would be to raise productivity and resilience in agriculture, followed by employment and skilling, inclusive human resource development and social justice.

Infrastructure and next generation reforms also figure in the priorities, with the Minister promising more details about the latter through an economic policy framework to be formulated later, with a focus on fixing factors of productivity, including land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship. She also announced a review of the Income Tax and Customs Acts, a simplification of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms, and a financial sector vision document for five years.

Fiscal consolidation

While investors will need to wait for those details, the Finance Minister did provide some indirect support to private investments by accelerating the fiscal consolidation process, armed with a ₹2.1 lakh crore surprise dividend from the central bank. The fiscal deficit target for this year has been pegged at 4.9% of GDP from the 5.1% projected in the Interim Budget, and the 5.6% of GDP achieved last year. A reduction in the government’s market borrowings would facilitate a reduction in policy interest rates and encourage private investment, EY’s chief policy advisor D.K. Srivastava pointed out.

Among the PM’s employment package schemes is a plan to provide one year internships in 500 top companies to one crore youth over five years. It is not clear if this will subsume the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0 that was announced in the last Budget to “skill lakhs of youth within the next three years” with an on-the-job training component.

As is the case with many initiatives of this Budget, more details will emerge over time. But Ms. Sitharaman, who began her speech by thanking the people of India for re-electing a government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be hoping that the lens change reflected in the Budget’s focus areas will not be lost on voters gearing up to cast their ballots in the upcoming State Assembly elections.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-nirmala-sitharaman-signals-shift-from-earlier-trickle-down-strategy-to-a-slew-of-schemes/article68438379.ece

The import duty on “Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate” (MDI) will be reduced to 5% from the current 7.5% to “rectify inversion in duty”. The Finance Minister said, “To enhance the competitiveness of exports in the leather and textile sectors, I propose to reduce BCD on real down filling material from duck or goose. I am also making additions to the list of exempted goods for manufacture of leather and textile garments, footwear and other leather articles for export.”

There will be no duty on wet white, crust, and finished leather for manufacture of garments, footwear and other leather products for exports, down from the current 10%. Duty on some additional accessories for manufacture of textile and leather garments, leather and synthetic footwear or other leather products for exports will also be removed, and the real down filling material from duck or goose for use in manufacture of garments for exports will be 10% from the current 30%.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: What is taxonomy for climate finance?,"The story so far: The 2024 Union Budget, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday, includes developing a taxonomy for climate finance to enhance the availability of capital for climate adaptation and mitigation.

“This will support achievement of the country’s climate commitments and green transition,” Ms. Sitharaman said in her speech.

What is taxonomy for climate finance?

Climate finance taxonomy refers to a set of standardised regulations and guidelines to inform companies and investors on making impactful investments towards environmental conservation and combating the climate crisis.

The term taxonomy originally comes from the field of biology. It is the scientific method of naming and classifying organisms, including plants, animals, and microorganisms.

According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, “diverse interpretations fragment markets and confuse investors. What seems ‘green’ in one country may appear ‘brown’ elsewhere, stalling environmental progress,”

Taxonomies for sustainable climate financing, in general, include a detailed list of economic sectors and activities and corresponding criteria that determine if it aligns with larger climate goals.

“There are two dimensions to a taxonomy: the system itself in all its complexity, and the final product (boiled down to its pragmatic essentials) as it will be used by financial market participants and other users. Users of taxonomies and definitions are not necessarily interested in understanding why a given metric or threshold must be used for an activity. Rather, they will use the taxonomies and definitions as a final product and screen activities to determine eligibility under the taxonomy,” according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

Climate finance taxonomies are known as ‘green’ taxonomies.

Why is climate finance taxonomy important?

Climate financing forms a core area of combating the climate crisis. According to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC’s) first ‘Needs Determination Report’, financing of around $5.8-5.9 trillion is required to implement developing countries’ climate action plans by 2030, and this does not fully include adaptation costs.

Climate finance taxonomies can facilitate financing for investors, credit institutions etc. based on how climate-aligned an entity or an activity is. It can therefore direct financial resources towards projects that support climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Green taxonomies help investors compare investment opportunities and measure their environmental impact. A localised climate finance taxonomy can also help align a country’s climate goals with the Paris Agreement and other international climate commitments while accounting for regional factors that influence localised transition pathways.

For example, different regions will have to adopt different pathways to reach the goal of limiting global warming to under 1.5 degrees C, as required under the Paris Agreement. A one-size-fits-all approach won’t work here, and where localised taxonomies on climate finance can help. Science-based targets at the regional level can help define metrics, based on which experts can develop standards and investors can determine their financial commitments, all without compromising on global climate goals.

Climate finance taxonomies can also help prevent greenwashing by companies by setting common standards based on scientific assessments.

“The development of a taxonomy for climate finance is crucial for establishing clear standards. It ensures that investments are transparently and efficiently directed towards genuine green projects, driving innovation and supporting India’s ambitious climate goals,” Harjeet Singh, Global Engagement Director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, told The Hindu.

Many countries like China, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka have already issued green taxonomies to facilitate climate-sensitive investments.

Editorial | Towards a green growth: On the RBI and a green taxonomy

What has India done to set up a green taxonomy?

In January 2021, India established a task force on sustainable finance under the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, to create a framework for sustainable finance in India, establish the pillars for a sustainable finance roadmap, suggest draft taxonomy of sustainable activities, and create a framework of risk assessment by the financial sector.

In April that year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) joined the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) as a member. RBI is also a member of a task force on climate-related financial risks set up by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance.

Why does India need a green taxonomy?

According to the IFC, India needs an estimated $10.1 trillion to achieve net-zero by 2070. Public investments alone can’t match this goal, which calls for standardisation in investments.

“A green taxonomy framework could significantly help India attract both domestic and international investments, aligning these funds with its national and global commitments to a green transition and enhanced climate resilience,” Mr. Singh said.

“Investors and industry have been demanding a taxonomy and transition pathway as guidance for flow of finance and reorientation of economic activity. The Budget announcements that clearly mention the establishment of a carbon market, taxonomy and transition pathways mark significant progress in planning towards net zero in 2070,” Suranjali Tandon, an associate professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-what-is-taxonomy-for-climate-finance-explained/article68437217.ece

She further urged, “We will encourage states to provide support of similar scale for infrastructure development based on their priorities.”

The finance minister stated that private investment in infrastructure will be promoted through Viability Gap Funding and a market-based financing framework would be brought out. Chief Economic Advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran writing in the Economic Survey tabled on Monday had held that for India to build quality infrastructure, a higher level of private sector financing and resource mobilisation would be crucial. “Facilitating this would not only require policy and institutional support from the Central Government, but State and Local Governments would have to play an equally important role,” the Economic Survey author stated.

Reacting to the Budget presented in the Parliament by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday, he said: “We hoped that the daughter-in-law of Telugu States would allocate significant funds to Telangana in the budget. But what we got is nothing. It is disappointing that Telangana has not found even a mention in her entire budget speech”.

He stated that then Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had requested the Centre in the past to take decisions on nearly 35 promises made in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Several letters were written and appeals were made personally, whenever there was an opportunity. But, there was no mention of additional funds for Mulugu University, setting up the Bayyaram Steel Factory and Railway Coach Factory at Kazipet.

Despite the Telangana Government’s requests, national status had not been granted to any irrigation projects in the State and there was no response even for pleas made for national institutes such as IIM, for industrial corridors from Mumbai-Nagpur-Hyderabad, Hyderabad-Bengaluru and Hyderabad-Chennai. Even the request for the establishment of a new handloom cluster along with a mega power loom cluster, was overlooked, he said.

Calling the Union Budget 2024-25 ""discriminatory"" and ""dangerous"", the Congress on Tuesday evening announced that the party's Chief Ministers -- Siddaramaiah (Karnataka), Revanth Reddy (Telangana), and Sukhvinder Sukhu (Himachal Pradesh) -- will not attend the Niti Aayog Governing Council meeting scheduled in the national capital on July 27.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK chief MK Stalin too has said that he would boycott the NITI Aayog meeting to be chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 27 as a mark of protest.

""The Union Budget presented today was extremely discriminatory and dangerous, which completely goes against the principles of federalism and fairness that the Union government must follow. In protest, INC CMs will be boycotting the NITI Aayog meeting scheduled for 27th July,"" Congress General Secretary (Organisation), KC Venugopal said in a post on X.

""This government's attitude is completely antithetical to Constitutional principles. We will not participate in an event that is solely designed to hide the true, discriminatory colours of this regime,"" he added.

Earlier in the day, Finance Minister Niramala Sitharaman announced a slew of measures during her 80-minute Budget speech, including a hike in standard deduction in the new tax regime from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000, revisions to tax slabs in the new regime, cut in Customs duty on gold and silver, three schemes under employment-linked incentives, and Rs 2 lakh crore for job creation, among others.

However, the Congress took a jibe at the Centre soon after the announcements, calling them nothing but a ""Sarkar Bachao"" Budget driven by the political compulsions for the survival of this ""lame duck"" government.

Taking to X, Mr Venugopal said, ""The Budget will do nothing to address inflation or solve the farmers' crisis. It has absolutely nothing for the middle classes. Much like the 10 (previous) Budgets, this Union Budget is also far removed from the concerns of the ordinary Indian.""

""While the government has belatedly recognised that job creation is the need of the hour, its so-called announcements are totally insincere and non-serious. They could not even properly copy from our Nyay Patra.""

According to Mr Venugopal, merely throwing large headline numbers while giving pittances in reality is nothing but a cruel joke on the future of India's youth.

""Every segment of the Indian society is going to be in an even worse situation after this Budget, and this government that is completely cut off from the pain of the people will simply be concerned about its survival,"" he said.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Glass both half-full and half-empty for science Ministries,"The allocations for the traditional science Ministries and departments in the Union Budget presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday present a dull picture against the 2023-2024 figures. However, the picture brightens up if their continuing under-utilisation is taken into account.

The Department of Science and Technology (DST) received ₹8,029 crore, a marginal increase over the ₹7,931 crore from last year, but nearly two-thirds more than its utilisation of ₹4,891.78 crore.

Revenue expenditure under other scientific research accounts for the bulk of these numbers. The allocation for the National Quantum Mission jumped from zero last year to ₹427 crore this year. This Mission “aims to seed, nurture, and scale up scientific and industrial R&D and create a vibrant and innovative ecosystem in quantum technologies”. The Union Cabinet approved it in April 2023 with a total outlay of ₹6,000 crore over eight years.

The allocation for the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has been cut from ₹2,683.86 crore to ₹2,275.7 crore this year, yet it had more than ₹1,000 crore in unspent funds last year. Notably, its allocation under biotechnology R&D has dropped from ₹1,345 crore last year to ₹1,100 crore this year and under ‘other scientific research’ from ₹2,472.97 crore to ₹2,087.26 crore this year as against a utilisation last year of ₹1,508.07 crore.

The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), which oversees the more than three dozen DSIR laboratories around the country, tells a different story. It overspent its allocation last year by 8% but has received only a 2% hike over that. The hike brings its allocation this year to ₹6,323.41 crore.

The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has been given ₹3,064.80 crore — a modest increase over its actual expenditure of ₹2,879.02 crore last year but a 7.6% cut from the budgeted value. The capital outlay on oceanographic research has increased by ₹53 crore to ₹280 crore whereas that for meteorology has dropped by ₹168 crore to ₹276.20 crore. Among other activities, the MoES is currently piloting the ‘Deep Ocean Mission’, to develop vehicles to explore the ocean, prospect for resources, and develop technologies to mine them. The Union Cabinet approved it in 2022 at a cost of ₹4,000 crore.

Including the respective allocations and utilisation by the Departments of Space (DoS) and of Atomic Energy (DAE), the total increase across all these departments and Ministries over the budgeted allocation last year is -1.3% whereas over the revised expenditure it is +20.85%.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-under-spending-brightens-allocations-for-science-ministries-depts/article68436553.ece

The finance minister will visit the Ministry of Finance’s North Block headquarters before announcing the budget. She will meet with her ministry’s secretaries and then accompany them to the President’s mansion to obtain authorization prior to presenting the Budget.

Prior to the budget announcement, the halwa ceremony is another important occasion. The budget document printing process is traditionally initiated by the government with a ‘halwa ceremony’ a few days before to the budget’s presentation. The commencement of the lockdown at the Finance Ministry, which prohibits any official from leaving the ministry compound, coincides with the Halwa ritual, which is why it is crucial.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu flays BJP-led government for ignoring disaster-hit Himachal,"Even as Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said that Himachal Pradesh, which suffered extensive losses due to floods last year, would be provided aid through multilateral development assistance, its Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu accused the BJP-led Union government of yet again ignoring the interest of the hill State and its people.

Last year, following an unprecedented monsoon rain spell that triggered several incidents of flash floods and landslides, the State government had to declare the State as a ‘natural calamity affected area’. Ms. Sitharaman, presenting the Union Budget 2024-25, acknowledged the State’s losses and said, “Our government will provide assistance to the State for reconstruction and rehabilitation through multilateral development assistance.”

Hitting out at the BJP, Mr. Sukhu — in Shimla — said that the Centre had again disappointed Himachal Pradesh by ignoring its long pending demands and the aspirations of its people.

“Himachal government had requested the Centre to release ₹9,042 crore as financial assistance following a post-disaster assessment carried out by a Central team,” he noted. Knowing well that Himachal suffered enormously during last year’s disaster, the Budget offered only assurances and promises but nothing concrete in its relief package, he charged.

He also pointed out that a ‘special grant’ for Himachal had been denied despite strong recommendations in its favour.

Terming the budget “inequitable”, Mr. Sukhu highlighted several key areas of concern and called for immediate revisions to address the needs of the wider population of the State.

The State had repeatedly raised its demands for financial assistance for road, air and rail connectivity but it was unfortunate that none of them had been given any attention, he added.

The Budget failed to address the issue of expansion of the rail network in the State, financial assistance for the industrial sector and various tourism activities, the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Sukhu added that the Union Budget had once again failed to address the pressing issues plaguing our country, particularly unemployment, poverty and rising prices.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/himachal-pradesh/budget-2024-sukhvinder-singh-sukhu-flays-bjp-led-government-for-ignoring-disaster-hit-himachal/article68437089.ece

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 sets the stage for a sustainable growth trajectory for real estate,"Covering a wide spectrum of Indian sectors, the first Union Budget of Modi 3.0 laid its focus on MSMEs, employment, skilling, youth, and the middle class. While the Budget sidestepped the long-standing demands of the real estate sector, the focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, boost to infrastructure, urban redevelopment and relaxation in income tax slabs are the big reforms that will indirectly provide a fillip to the real estate sector.

“The call to State Governments to reduce stamp duty and initiate land related reforms that includes urban planning, usage, building bylaws, and GIS mapping of land records are steps in the right direction that will not just help the sector but also be a strong growth propeller for the Indian economy,” said Samir Jasuja, Founder and CEO of PropEquity.

The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the PPP model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and Transit-Oriented Developments.

“The additional 3 crore housing units in rural and urban areas under PMAY is a welcome step for closing the gap in the sector. The decision to increase the standard deduction along with lowering the tax slabs in the new tax regime for personal income tax should lead to an increase in disposable incomes for the middle-income group. This will bode well for demand in affordable and mid-income housing. The changes in capital gains tax remain an area of concern, though,” said Anurag Mathur, CEO, Savills India.

Amit Goyal, Managing Director, India Sotheby’s International Realty, said, “The budget strikes a delicate balance: prioritizing infrastructure, job creation, and MSMEs while maintaining fiscal discipline. The commitment to reduce the deficit to 4.5% and below over the next few years by FM Nirmala Sitharaman, is commendable. This ensures long-term economic stability, high credit rating and FDI inflows for India. In a young nation with a large youth population (40% under 25!), skilling and job creation are crucial.”

For real estate transaction, bringing down the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5% is a welcome step, even if it comes with removal of indexation benefits. This will encourage more liquidity in property transactions. Higher uniformity in long term capital gains tax across different asset classes was a long standing ask of investors.

“The push for digitization, efficient land management, and modernized bylaws is also a boost for urbanisation and real estate. This will improve ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes,” he added.

Sunil Dewali, Co-CEO of Andromeda Sales & Distribution Pvt Ltd, parent company of Andromeda Realty Advisors, said, “The Finance Minister’s announcement to make housing more affordable, with a Rs 2.2 lakh crore push under the PM Awas Yojana-Urban, is a major step forward. Addressing the needs of one crore poor and middle-class families with a Rs 10 lakh crore investment over five years, it reflects a robust approach to urban development. Encouraging states to reduce high stamp duty rates, especially for women buyers, is progressive. Digitizing land records, GIS mapping, and urban housing initiatives, alongside workforce skilling, will boost the real estate sector. Significant infrastructure investments and simplified FDI rules will drive private investment, fostering economic growth and stability.”

Here we take a look at some of India’s leading developers’ budget reactions:

Jogendra Singh, CFO and Group President (Finance), Hero Realty Private Ltd: “The Finance minister has presented a long-term sustainable growth-oriented budget through focus on all drivers of the economy including agriculture, employment generation, skill development, urban development, energy, infra push, R&D and innovation push and creating an engine to steer ’Bharat’ into ‘Viksit Bharat’. The proposals on industry are welcome and growth-oriented, however on personal taxation, the changes may create a negative sentiment with changes in capital gains tax. Other tax proposals are on expected lines to reduce litigation, dispute and complexity. Decriminalization in certain defaults is a welcome step.”

Sanjeev Kumar Sharma, CFO, M3M India: “The Budget for 2024 shows a forward-thinking approach, tackling the changing requirements of India’s property market. The focus on building infrastructure and providing support for housing matches well with the changing desires of those looking to buy homes. There’s a clear pattern where people are becoming more open to spending more, choosing developments that include extra living areas and contemporary facilities. The Real Estate sector is focusing on aligning with the government’s initiatives and demonstrating a commitment to addressing the evolving needs of homebuyers. This budget creates a setting that supports steady expansion, allowing companies like M3M India to innovate and produce top-notch housing developments. We are hopeful for what’s to come and are ready to make a significant impact on the industry, in line with the government’s goals.”

Vivek Singhal, CEO, Smartworld Developers: “The 2024 Union Budget reaffirms the government’s commitment to urban development and housing, aligning perfectly with the real estate sector’s growth trajectory. The substantial allocation of Rs 11.11 lakh crore for infrastructure development, representing 3.4% of India’s GDP, is a significant boost that will have far-reaching positive impacts on our industry. The government’s encouragement for states to moderate stamp duty rates is a welcome move that could potentially stimulate property transactions. The consideration of further duty reductions for properties purchased by women is an innovative step towards promoting inclusivity in homeownership. These measures build upon the robust growth we witnessed in 2023, where housing sales in the top seven cities reached an all-time high of 4.77 lakh units. As we progress through 2024, we anticipate that these budget provisions, combined with the sector’s inherent strengths, will maintain this momentum. The budget’s focus on urban development and housing will undoubtedly enhance real estate’s appeal to both homebuyers and investors.”

Kunal Rishi, COO, Paras Buildtech: “In this landmark budget, the government has demonstrated a strong commitment to propelling India towards a ‘Viksit Bharat’. The measures announced, particularly the encouragement to states to moderate stamp duties and the consideration of reduced duties for properties purchased by women, are significant steps forward. These initiatives will not only make homeownership more accessible but will also stimulate urban development across the country. The allocation of Rs 11.11 lakh crore for capital expenditure is a clear indication of the government’s dedication to infrastructure development. This substantial investment will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the real estate sector, driving growth and enhancing urban living standards. Furthermore, the Rs 10 lakh crore investment under PM Awas Yojana Urban 2.0 to address the housing needs of the urban poor and middle class is a commendable initiative. This move will provide a much-needed boost to urban housing and ensure that more families have access to affordable and quality homes. Overall, this budget sets a robust foundation for sustainable growth in the real estate sector and reaffirms the government’s vision for a progressive and inclusive India.”

Ashish Sharma, AVP Operations, Brahma Group: “The Budget 2024 brings in great tax incentives and simpler regulations to boost investments in housing and infrastructure projects. Additionally, it aims to improve funding for developers and homebuyers, support housing initiatives, and promote sustainable urban development. Moreover, the proposed Rs 10 lakh crore investment sets the stage for a transformative era in the real estate sector, promising better connectivity and urban expansion. The budget’s emphasis on accessibility, affordability, and environmental sustainability shows its dedication to creating job opportunities and ensuring robust sectoral growth in the coming years.”

Ashish Agarwal, Director, AU Real Estate: “We wholeheartedly embrace the Union Budget 2024-25 unveiled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, particularly the ambitious allocation for infrastructure development. The proposed investment of Rs 10 lakh crore signals a transformative era for the real estate sector, paving the way for enhanced connectivity and urban expansion. By prioritizing ease of doing business and supporting job creation, this budget fosters an environment ripe for investment and innovation. We believe these strategic initiatives will not only meet the growing demand for housing but also stimulate economic growth, benefiting developers, buyers, and communities alike. Together, we can build a brighter future, turning vision into reality in the vibrant landscape of real estate.”

Aman Trehan, Executive Director, Trehan Iris: “The Union Budget 2024-25 has ignited a sense of optimism within the real estate fraternity. The substantial capital expenditure of Rs 10 lakh crore earmarked for infrastructure development is a testament to the government’s commitment to fostering a conducive environment for growth. As real estate developers, we are particularly enthused by the emphasis on ease of doing business and the incentives aimed at job creation. These measures will undoubtedly catalyze investment and spur innovation in the sector. Moreover, the focus on housing and urban development aligns perfectly with our vision of creating vibrant, livable communities. We are confident that this budget will serve as a catalyst for the real estate industry, propelling it towards new heights of success and sustainability.”

Santosh Agarwal, CFO and Executive Director of Alphacorp: “We applaud the government for its forward-thinking budget proposals, which hold significant promise for the real estate sector. The emphasis on ‘Viksit Bharat’ as a theme for this year is particularly commendable as it aims to bridge the urban-rural divide and ensure inclusive development across regions. Lower stamp duties aim to make property more affordable for women, boosting home ownership and stimulating real estate transactions. This reduction in costs is expected to encourage more women and families to take benefit of the savings. Furthermore, investment-ready ‘plug and play’ industrial parks will be developed in or near 100 cities, with 12 parks already sanctioned under the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme. These initiatives are poised to bolster industrial growth, attract investments, and boost local economies across the nation.”

LC Mittal, Director, Motia Group: “Bringing investment in urban housing to ₹10 lakh crore under PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 is a quantum jump seen in the nation’s response towards its urban housing crisis. A commitment of this magnitude for one crore families exhibits that the Centre is serious about making urban development inclusive. The contribution by Centre, which will be ₹2.2 lakh crore over a period of five years, gives financial muscle to the scheme. This huge investment is most likely to have far-reaching effects beyond the simple provision of housing. It could stimulate the construction sector, create millions of jobs, and boost allied industries. What’s more, along with mixing poor and middle-class families, the scheme recognizes the variety of housing needs across the socio-economic spectrum in urban India. Such an approach could usefully contribute to the reduction of inequality within cities and improve living conditions within India’s fast-growing towns.”

Aman Gupta, Director of RPS Group: “Ambitious targets for meeting the housing needs of 1 crore urban families under PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 point toward the enormity of the challenge that is urban housing in India. With projected urbanization to reach 50 percent in 2050, this ₹10-lakh-crore investment had been most timely and sorely required. The ₹2.2 lakh crore central assistance is a very strong model of public-private partnership, in which government support will act as a catalyst for private investment. This could result in innovative financing models and construction technologies in the affordable housing sector. Moreover, unlike most housing policies that leave out this ‘missing middle,’ the scheme targets both poor and middle-class families. If implemented correctly, this can potentially reduce a huge urban housing shortage of 18.78 million units in the year 2012 and change the urban landscape of India. It is a game-changing announcement that the FM made by stating an investment of ₹10 lakh crore in urban housing under PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 for India’s real estate sector.”

Anurag Goel, Director at Goel Ganga Developments: “The FM’s announcement of ₹10 lakh crore investment in urban housing under PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 is thus a shot in the arm for India’s real estate sector. This huge infusion—₹2.2 lakh crore in central assistance—can indeed rejuvenate the affordable segment of housing, which has remained in a challenging position over the past few years. For the target of 1 crore families within five years, it translates to about 20 lakh houses per annum, which becomes a significant scaling-up from the current version of the scheme. It can also generate enhanced demand for construction materials and may revive sectors such as cement, steel, and home appliances. It is in this regard that additional focus on the middle-class families, apart from the urban poor, broadens the scheme’s scope and possibly leads to more diversified housing typologies and urban design solutions. This kind of holistic approach can play a huge role in realizing the government’s vision of ‘Housing for All’.”

Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited: “The outlay of ₹10 lakh crore for urban housing under PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 is of an amount that would largely share in the annual GDP of India, thus showing the priority in the housing sector by the government. The ₹2.2 lakh crore central assistance spread over five years offers a stable funding base, which is so important to long-term planning in the real estate sector. Targeting 1 crore families, this scheme addresses roughly 22% of India’s urban households, according to the 2011 census. The scale of intervention would be large enough to hopefully bring down urban poverty, for adequate housing has been inextricably interwoven with health, education, and economic outcomes. Besides, incorporating middle-class families at least gives due recognition to the budding aspirations of India’s urban population. If effectively implemented, this has the potential to go a long way in bridging the yawning urban housing gap and making critically vital contributions toward India’s economic growth and development across the urban landscape.”

Ravi Saund, Founding Director, Emperium Private Limited: “The Finance Minister’s announcement of a Rs 10 lakh crore investment in urban housing through PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 represents a major boost for India’s real estate sector. The Rs 2.2 lakh crore allocated for central assistance will revitalize the affordable housing segment, which has struggled in recent years. With a target of providing homes to 1 crore families over the next five years, this initiative translates to approximately 20 lakh houses annually, marking a substantial increase from the previous scheme. This surge in construction activity is expected to boost demand for building materials and rejuvenate related industries such as cement, steel, and home appliances. By extending its focus to middle-class families in addition to the urban poor, the scheme’s expanded scope promises to foster diverse housing solutions and innovations in urban design. This comprehensive approach is a significant step towards achieving the government’s ‘Housing for All’ vision.”

Vikas Aggarwal, COO, Worldwide Realty: “FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s bold move to allocate Rs 10 lakh crore to the PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 marks a pivotal moment for the real estate sector. As urbanization accelerates towards 50% by 2050, this comprehensive investment is exactly what is needed to meet the burgeoning housing demands. The substantial Rs 2.2 lakh crore central assistance is a testament to the government’s strategic vision for fostering public-private collaborations. This financial backing is expected to spur innovative solutions in affordable housing and bring forward advanced construction methods. Notably, the scheme’s inclusive approach, addressing both the underprivileged and the middle class, fills a critical gap left by previous policies. With proper implementation, this initiative holds the potential to alleviate the vast urban housing deficit and reshape India’s urban environments significantly.”

Saransh Trehan, Managing Director, Trehan Group: “The essentiality for Housing for All becomes the mainstay for Budget 2024 yet again as the announcement of PMAY Urban Housing 2.0 becomes one of the salient attractions. Under the scheme, the government offers to provide homes at subsidized rates and allocates Rs 10 lakh crore for the initiative. The introduction of Rental housing to be built on PPP mode and upsizing of retail infrastructure will be crucial in empowering the real estate sector and housing segments and promoting all forms of property developments in metro as well as Tier 2 and 3 cities.”

Dushyant Singh, Director, Orion One 32: “The Union Budget 2024 offers some promising roads to development, urbanization, and infrastructural developments. The announcement of Urban Housing 2.0 with a budget allocation of Rs 10 lakh crore will secure the lives of thousands of people struggling to make two ends meet and living in makeshift homes in urban cities and towns. The availability of homes at subsidized rates will incentivize them to invest in properties. On the other hand, the government’s focus on rental housing expected to be built on PPP mode is also approbation-worthy and designed to improve living conditions for industrial workers.”

Neeraj K Mishra, Executive Director, Ganga Realty: “As one of the largest employment-generating sectors in India, a renewed focus on employment creation in the Union Budget 2024 is noteworthy and will attract upskilled talent in real estate too. It also recognizes infrastructural development as one of the critical growth propellers and promote state-level infrastructural developments to attract key investments in different parts of the country. With the promulgation of PMAY Urban Housing 2.0 and the earmarking of 10 lakh crore for the programme, the government once again prioritizes its core agenda of achieving Housing for All in Budget 2024. Providing homes at subsidized rates will be instrumental in alleviating thousands of people from a life of poverty and destitution and imbuing their lives with one of the qualitative facilities, which is also a crucial marker of judging the quality of life- housing. While allocating fresh budgets for emboldening housing has become a commonality in Budget announcements, the focus on rental housing for industrial workers, which will be taken up in a PPP mode, comes off as a good surprise and a refreshing step towards promoting diverse forms of housing.”",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-sets-the-stage-for-a-sustainable-growth-trajectory-for-real-estate-3563135/
financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: ‘Need to recognise indispensable role of technology in shaping the future of healthcare’,"Union Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will announce the Union Budget 2024-25 today. Industry leaders emphasise on building infrastructure and technology for healthcare.

“We expect a budget that fortifies the cornerstone of our nation’s healthcare system. A robust and sturdy healthcare system is essential to India’s economic development. We believe that the budget will place more of an emphasis on building infrastructure and technology for healthcare as well as on hiring qualified medical personnel. Improving these fundamental elements would make it possible to provide better healthcare services and guarantee that underserved areas and low-income individuals are sufficiently serviced,” Dr Vaibhav Kapoor, Co-founder, Pristyn Care told Financial Express.com.

A robust healthcare system is vital for our population’s well-being and the country’s overall growth, Dr. Kapoor said.

“India must strengthen its infrastructure, invest in advanced medical technologies and enable trajectories for upskilling of healthcare professionals. Healthcare technology strengthening can enable doctors to scale up patient care and management and open new pathways to a futuristic care ecosystem,” he said.

Meanwhile, Rahul Cordeiro, CFO, of Wipro GE Healthcare said that in 2023-24, the budget underscored the importance of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.

“Today, India is preparing to become ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. As we set a visionary blueprint for growth, the first Union Budget of the government is particularly significant for healthcare sector. As India aims to become the global manufacturing and MedTech hub, the country needs a promising outlay for the sector to encourage collaboration in R&D and high-end indigenous manufacturing and research. While National Medical Devices Policy 2023, Production Linked Incentive Scheme, Promotion of Research, and Innovation in Pharma MedTech Sector (PRIP) Scheme will help India unlock its full potential, the dependency on import continues to be a challenge,” Cordeiro told Financial Express.com.

We must solve for the persisting headwinds that have long impacted the sector, import dependence being one, he said.

“We are hopeful the budget will answer some critical questions such as – how can we accelerate the pace for ‘Make in India’ by prioritizing sourcing of domestically manufactured MedTech, can rebates to private healthcare providers buying local equipment, especially in underserved areas, incentivize wider adoption, and how can we boost local R&D through Innovation Linked Incentive schemes on the lines of PLI for manufacturing,” he added.

According to Sameer Dashputre, Chief Strategy Officer & Co-Founder, Dozee, delivering quality healthcare across wide geography with limited Human Resources is India’s key challenge.

“Technology is the biggest force multiplier which will enable us to bridge the gap in shorter time and lesser cost. We recommend fund allocation for a dedicated Bharat Healthtech AI for developing and implementing large-scale adoption of indigenous AI-powered technologies. The focus of the AI technologies should be on addressing the shortage of medical skills and mass screening for NCD control,” Dashputre told Financial Express.com.

Moreover, Sajeev Nair, Founder and Chairman, Vieroots the Union Budget 2024 should recognize the indispensable role of technology in shaping the future of healthcare.

“Investments in digital health solutions, telemedicine, and health informatics can bridge the gap between urban and rural healthcare accessibility. The government should consider incentivizing startups that leverage technology to enhance healthcare delivery, ensuring that the benefits of innovation are widespread and not confined to urban centres,” Nair told Financial Express.com.

Additionally, the government should allocate more resources for preventive health measures, including screening, prognosis, and cardiac and cancer risk assessment, given India’s high mortality rates in these areas, he said.

According to Nair, a stronger focus on the ‘Fit India’ movement is crucial, as awareness is the key to success. Just as the government successfully promoted the Swachh Bharat Mission through extensive awareness campaigns, a similar approach should be adopted for the Fit India campaign. With the average age of the Indian population around 30, motivating individuals to stay healthy and fit will significantly boost national productivity.

“Access to quality healthcare should be a fundamental right for every individual, irrespective of socioeconomic status. Achieving universal healthcare coverage requires concerted efforts from both the public and private sectors, along with policy interventions to bridge healthcare disparities. Increased medical education should not solely focus on producing more doctors but also prioritize holistic healthcare delivery,” Nair told Financial Express.com.

Moreover, the government has increased the allocation of Rs 1,100 crore for biotechnology research and development. The output of biotechnology R&D tangibly touches our everyday lives. Biotech innovations in healthcare have led to groundbreaking treatments, improved diagnostic tools, and personalized medicine. Therefore, the government should continue to remain focused on biotechnology R&D to provide better healthcare to society at large, he said.

“The Union Budget 2024 should emphasize preventive health measures, technological advancements, and universal healthcare access. These steps will ensure a healthier, more productive population and a robust healthcare system,” he added.

Tetsuya Yamada, MD, OMRON Healthcare India India’s healthcare system faces a significant challenge due to the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

“One of the main types of NCD is cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke which have hypertension as one of the primary underlying causes. India has more than 220 million people who suffer from high blood pressure, but a WHO study showed that only 15% of them receive treatment. Around 5% of them use a digital BP monitor. This implies that most of them are unaware of their condition, or they don’t get the proper treatment. To effectively address this concern, it is crucial to raise awareness about the issue and its potential solutions, such as the regular monitoring of hypertension and ECG at home, to ensure more proactive health management,” Yamada told Financial Express.com.

We hope that the government will keep in mind the importance of implementing policies and promoting widespread knowledge of preventive care, which can reduce the burden of costs for hospitalization and surgery, he added.

“Additionally, it is equally important to monitor the market and maintain the quality and availability of home healthcare monitoring devices. This will help prevent the circulation of counterfeit medical-grade devices in the market, which could hinder the advancement of healthcare. We anticipate that the Union Budget 2024-25 will reflect a forward-thinking approach including preventive care at home, aligning with industry needs, and ultimately establishing a resilient and advanced healthcare framework,” he pointed out.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-need-to-recognise-indispensable-role-of-technology-in-shaping-the-future-of-healthcare-3561703/

Dr. Mandeep Singh Malhotra, Director of Surgical Oncology at CK Birla Hospital, Delhi highlighted some critical aspects of these life-saving cancer medicines and the impact of custom duty exemption.

What are these drugs used for specifically?

It is also being studied for use in other types of cancer, such as gastric cancer. Osimertinib: This is a targeted therapy used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific mutations in the EGFR gene.

This is a targeted therapy used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific mutations in the EGFR gene. It is particularly effective against cancers that have developed resistance to earlier generations of EGFR inhibitors. Durvalumab: This is an immunotherapy drug that works by blocking the PD-L1 protein, helping the immune system to attack cancer cells. It is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer).

How much will the cost come down?

The exact reduction in cost will depend on the current customs duty rates and other associated costs such as import taxes and logistics, Dr. Malhotra explained. According to Dr. Malhotra, exemption from basic customs duty could potentially reduce the price by 10-20 percent, making these treatments more affordable for patients. However, precise figures would require detailed pricing and duty structure analysis, he highlighted.

How commonly are these drugs prescribed?

Trastuzumab Deruxtecan: This is commonly prescribed for patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer who have not responded to other treatments. It is relatively new but has shown significant promise in clinical trials.

How will the removal of customs duties help cancer patients?

Exempting these drugs from basic customs duty will lower their import costs, making them more affordable for patients. According to Dr. Malhotra, this can improve access to advanced cancer treatments, reduce the financial burden on patients and their families, and potentially improve treatment outcomes by allowing more patients to benefit from these effective therapies.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-these-cancer-medicines-get-custom-duty-exemption-what-does-this-exactly-means-3562662/

The country’s inflation continues to be stable and is moving towards 4 per cent, and core inflation stands at 3.1 pc.

The finance minister announced nine priorities in the Union Budget 2024-25 for generating ample opportunities in the economy. The nine priorities include productivity, jobs, social justice, urban development, energy security, infrastructure, innovation and reforms.

Rupee goes to

When it comes to expenditure, the highest amount goes towards States’ share of taxes and duties - 21%. In the Interim budget presented earlier this year, the major share of expenditure was marked to paying interest and the money given to the states, accounting for 20 per cent each of the total expenditure.

State-wise allocation of central taxes and duties

The Union Government had ₹1247211.28 crores of Union taxes and duties to distribute to the states. In statement showing the state-wise distribution of net proceeds of Union Taxes and Duties for Budget Estimates 2024-25, Uttar Pradesh receives the highest share at around 18% with ₹223737.23 crores.

Central sector scheme expenditure involves expenditure related to economic services, general services, subsidies, social services and others.

Other central expenditure involves interest payments, payments to autonomous bodies and others. Establishment expenditure involves the centre’s expenses for paying salaries, pensions and other payments. Finance commission grants and other transfers fall under transfers to states.

Allocation to ministries

The government allocated an outlay of ₹6,21,940.85 crore for defence for FY25, which is the highest among all the Union ministries.

thehindu.com,"Budget 2024: West Bengal deprived, Budget politically biased says Mamata","Alleging that West Bengal has been deprived in the Budget presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the State’s Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on July 23 dubbed it as a “politically biased Budget”.

“It is an anti-poor, anti-people, and politically biased Budget,” Ms. Banerjee told journalists in her chamber in the State Assembly. The Trinamool Congress chairperson accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government of “being envious of West Bengal” and said that the State received a “big zero” in the budgetary allocations.

“This budget is totally directionless, anti-people, with no vision, only a political mission in mind. I don’t see any light. It is dark, dark, and dark,” Ms. Banerjee said.

The Chief Minister raised questions on Centre’s proposal to provide flood assistance to neighbouring Sikkim. In her Budget speech, Ms. Sitharaman referred to devastating flash floods and landslides that wreaked havoc in Sikkim and added that the government will provide assistance to the State. ”If Sikkim gets and West Bengal is deprived. This is not good,” the Chief Minister said. She said that people of Darjeeling and Kalimpong should bear this in mind that while seeking votes the BJP promises everything but does not deliver. The BJP had won most of seats in north Bengal including Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat.

In her Budget speech the Finance Minister referred to the Amritsar Kolkata Industrial Corridor, and said the government will support development of an industrial node at Gaya. The Chief Minister said she had made provisions for the Dankuni Amritsar corridor long ago in 2009 and what the Finance Minister was promising was old wine in a new bottle.

Along with the Chief Minister, party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee reacted to the Budget saying that instead of tackling urgent issues like unemployment, rising prices and growing inflation, the “BJP has crafted a budget to bribe its coalition partners and buy time before the government implodes”. Mr. Banerjee also highlighted that Bengal has been constantly deprived by this BJP government at the Centre. “Has there been a positive outcome of 12 BJP MPs who are elected from Bengal? No! The net result is zero because Bengal has been constantly tortured & deprived. What Suvendu Adhikari said a few days ago Jo humare saath, hum unke saath [We are with those who are with us] has been proved today,” he said.

The Finance Minister in the Budget also referred to West Bengal while stressing on a plan, Purvodaya, “for the all-round development of the eastern region of the country covering Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh”.

TMC’s Rajya Sabha MP Sagarika Ghose spoke on similar lines and said they staged a walkout from the Upper House of Parliament in protest.

“This is a failed budget. It is to bribe two of the alliance partners - Bihar and Andhra Pradesh - not a Union Budget. This budget is bribing coalition partners before this government implodes,” she told reporters outside Parliament.

“We in the TMC have protested against this anti-Bengal budget. The TMC walked out of the Rajya Sabha. This is anti-federal. You cannot sacrifice the federal spirit at the alter of politics. It is ethically repugnant, constitutionally immoral and economically ruinous,” Ghose said.

Rajya Sabha MP Saket Gokhale alleged that there is an “open and shameless” discrimination against West Bengal in the budget.

“Open and shameless discrimination yet again in this Union Budget. Union Govt excludes only Bengal from flood relief and reconstruction funds,” he said in a post on X.

“Giving funds to other states while intentionally ignoring and singling out the people of Bengal is yet another revenge for BJP’s pathetic performance in elections,” Gokhale added.

“West Bengal contributes significant revenues to the Union but faces pathetic targeting and exclusion yet again in the Union Budget,” the TMC leader said.

Another Rajya Sabha MP of the party, Sushmita Dev, said central funds amounting to Rs 1.6 lakh crore are due to West Bengal and questioned how the budget exercise was being carried out without the census being held.

“You are calling the budget historic, but he is a king who does not know what the population is. There has been no census since 2011. If you do not know the exact numbers, how are you going to make the budget?” she asked.

thehindu.com,"Budget 2024: Not a word of ‘Telangana’, says Irrigation Minister Uttam Kumar Reddy","Telangana Irrigation and Civil Supplies Minister, N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has criticised Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for ignoring Telangana in the Union Budget 2024 presented on Tuesday.

Budget not for people, but to please BJP’s allies

Mr. Reddy said that the budget was politically motivated and drafted not for the people but to please Bharat Janata Party’s (BJP) allies: Janata Dal (U) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). While Bihar was given financial aid of ₹41,000 crore, Andhra Pradesh got ₹15,000 crore and other sops, including funds for completion of the Polavaram project. Congress-ruled States, especially Telangana, were totally neglected, he said.

“This is the 11th budget after the formation of Telangana in 2014. However, the new State remained neglected by the Centre. For the first time since 2014, a separate chapter titled ‘Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act’ was incorporated in the budget speech, but the Finance Minister did not mention the word ‘Telangana’ in her entire speech of 58 pages and 14,692 words,” he said.

Telangana ministers submitted various applications in the last seven months seeking funds

The Minister condemned Ms. Sitharaman for completely skipping the mention of Telangana when she spoke about the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act in her budget speech. “While we are not against the Centre giving special funds to Andhra Pradesh, we strongly condemn its discrimination towards Telangana. Led by Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy, a delegation of Telangana ministers submitted various applications to all ministries in the last seven months seeking funds for various projects. But our pleas were completely ignored. The BJP Government promised to fund the Polavaram project, but gave no assurance in her budget speech today of giving funds for Palamuru Ranga Lift Irrigation Scheme,” he said.

“We are still hopeful that the BJP Government at the Centre will provide the funds for the Palamuru Ranga Reddy Project as assured to us by the then Union Water Resources Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat,” he said.

He ridiculed the Finance Minister’s claim that the BJP Government was making ‘concerted efforts to fulfil the commitments in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act’. “People of Telangana have been waiting for the last ten years for the BJP Government to honour the promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act. The Railway Coach Factory in Kazipet, a steel factory at Bayyaram, funds for Tribal University, funds for high-speed road and rail connectivity, and other promises made in the Act remained unfulfilled.

“If Bihar and Andhra Pradesh deserved special funds, then why is Telangana being deprived of such treatment?” he asked.

No mention of backward regions in Telangana

Uttam Kumar Reddy said that the Finance Minister selectively sanctioned grants for the backward regions of Rayalaseema, Prakasam, and North Coastal Andhra but decided to skip the mention of the backward regions of Telangana. “While we welcome the Finance Minister’s announcement that commitments made in the AP Reorganisation Act will be fulfilled, we expect that commitments made with both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are fulfilled,” he said.

He said eight BJP MPs, including two Union Ministers - G Kishan Reddy and Bandi Sanjay - failed to get a decent share for Telangana in the Union Budget.

He said that the Union Budget was highly disappointing for Telangana as it deprived the State of its share in resources and welfare schemes.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-not-a-word-of-telangana-says-irrigation-minister-uttam-kumar-reddy/article68436403.ece

thehindu.com,Budget 2024: Kerala’s dream of AIIMS-like institution dashed again,"Kerala’s much-anticipated and decades-long dream of having an All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-like institution on its soil was dashed yet again when the proposal found no mention in the Union Budget 2024-25 presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23.

Also read: Budget 2024 LIVE, highlights

Unlike in the previous years, the anticipation this year that the project might finally come through was intense, particularly because of the presence of two Union Ministers of State from Kerala at the Centre, one of whom is the BJP’s first-ever elected MP from the State.

On July 22 too, the topic of approving an AIIMS-like institution for Kerala had been raised in Rajya Sabha by John Brittas, MP.

However, not just AIIMS, no major proposals for the nation’s health sector seemed to figure in the Union Budget 2024-25, other than the exemption of three more cancer drugs from customs duties.

The total allocation for the nation’s health sector in the Budget is ₹89,287 crore. The Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana has an allocation of ₹7,500 crore and the health coverage under the scheme has been extended to accredited social health activists (ASHA), anganwadi workers and helpers.

AIIMS was established as an autonomous institution in New Delhi under the Act of Parliament in 1956 and is today the apex medical institution in the country.

It is only after 2012 that the Centre began setting up AIIMS-like institutions across the country, under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY), a scheme announced in 2003, with the objectives of correcting regional imbalances in the availability of affordable/reliable tertiary healthcare services as well as augmenting facilities for quality medical education in the country.

There are today 22 AIIMS-like institutions in the country, some of which are operational, while the rest are in various phases of development.

A political and emotional issue

Over the past decade, having an AIIMS-like institution has become a political as well as emotional issue for Kerala and the feeling that the Centre was wilfully denying the State its due has been building.

The issue took on much political colour and was a much-debated topic of discussion in the State in the run up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections as well as the post-election debates, with many prominent MPs engaging in a war of words over “unfulfilled promises.”

While the State government seemed to have finalised Kinalur in Kozhikode as the ideal location to establish an AIIMS-like institution, Thiruvananthapuram, Palakkad and lately, Kasaragod have all been vying for the privilege.

Health Minister Veena George had informed the State Assembly in June that the Centre had accepted Kerala’s choice of Kinalur in Kozhikode to be the site for the proposed AIIMS-like institution but that the final approval on the project was still being awaited.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-keralas-dream-of-aiims-like-institution-dashed-again/article68436545.ece

opindia.com,"Rahul Gandhi slams Union Budget 2024, but claims it is copy paste of Congress manifesto","In continuation with his tradition of committing gaffes every once in a while, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today took to X, formerly Twitter, to lash out at the Union Budget 2024 announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Ridiculing the budget as the ‘Kursi Bachao’ budget, Gandhi, the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, asserted that the budget appeased cronies whom he referred to as ‘AA’ and appeased allies, claiming that hollow promises were made to them at the cost of other states.

But then, in the same tweet, Gandhi added that the budget is a ‘copy and paste’ of the Congress manifesto and previous budgets.

Source: X

As is often the case with the Gandhi scion, one is left to wonder what he is trying to speak and convey.

Let’s anyway still try to make sense of his tweet.

Gandhi labelled the budget as the ‘Kursi Bachao’ budget but then in the same breath he said it was a copy-paste of the Congress Manifesto. Does it mean that Congress endorsed appeasing allies and making “hollow promises” to them as alleged by the Wayanad MP?

It seems that Gandhi’s silence on the deaths in the Tamil Nadu hooch tragedy suggests that appeasing allies is at the centre of Congress’ politics, whether or not it is explicitly stated in their manifesto. So everyone in the Congress ecosystem goes hammer and tongs about violence in Manipur or a stray incident of a shop being ransacked because its owner tried to stoke communal feelings by uploading a provocative WhatsApp status but maintains radio silence on innocent people being killed in Tamil Nadu over consumption of spurious liquor.

About 65 people have already died in the Tamil Nadu hooch tragedy. But it has not sparked any reaction from the Leader of the Opposition, who perhaps thinks only the central government should be held to account and not the DMK-led state government in Tamil Nadu, because MK Stalin is after all, an important alliance member of the INDI bloc. The same goes for West Bengal. Congress leaders and its ecosystem turned a blind eye to the Chopra incident in West Bengal, where a goon in broad daylight mercilessly thrashed a woman.

Ironically, a complaint was lodged against BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya for sharing the video online. Again, the Congress leaders and the ecosystem didn’t wail ‘democracy is in danger’ since the state under scanner was West Bengal, ruled by Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress.

And if the Modi 3.0 indeed had made “hollow promises” to their allies, shouldn’t Congress and other states be happy that their progress and development won’t be compromised? But Congress supporters on X aren’t expected to have that intellectual depth. The hiring policy at most places expects candidates to have a reasonable IQ. But not at the Congress IT cell, which probably employs the criteria of hiring the dumbest lot available so that their crown prince can appear more intelligent and smart.

Crucially, Gandhi also claimed that the government was working for the appeasement of cronies, referring to them as ‘AA’. Given his history of targeting Ambani and Adani with no evidence whatsoever to substantiate his claims, almost characterising profit-making as an evil vice, it is not hard to guess for intelligent folks to whom he was referring. Congress IT cell members would claim ‘he didn’t name anyone’ but that’s not their fault, their mental incapacity constrains them.

The reference comes just days after several senior Congress leaders, including Former Chief Ministers Digvijaya Singh and Kamal Nath, prominent Congress leaders from Madhya Pradesh, Salman Khurshid, Former Union Minister, and Kapil Sibal, were among those who attended the grand Ambani celebrations that took place in Mumbai. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and his family were at the wedding events to bless the couple. And so was RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, another key member of the INDI bloc, who is out on bail on ‘medical grounds’ but was merrily attending the Anant-Radhika wedding with his entire family.

Were they all there to appease cronies? Who knows. Was it a part of the Congress manifesto? It is all too confusing and absurd, just Rahul Gandhi lambasting the budget and then saying it is a copy-paste of the Congress manifesto and previous budgets.

Ms. Sitharaman announced that short-term capital gains on ""specified"" financial assets will henceforth attract a tax rate of 20% instead of 15%. While all other financial assets and non-financial assets shall continue to attract the ""applicable tax rate"".

Long-term gains on all financial and non-financial assets will attract a tax rate of 12.5% instead of 10%.

On the positive side, for the benefit of the lower and middle-income classes, it was proposed to increase the limit of exemption of capital gains on certain listed financial assets from ₹1 lakh to ₹1.25 lakh per year.

Listed financial assets held for more than a year is classified as long-term, while unlisted financial assets and all non-financial assets will have to be held for at least two years to be classified as long-term.

""Unlisted bonds and debentures, debt mutual funds and market-linked debentures, irrespective of the holding period, however, will attract tax on capital gains at applicable rates,"" Ms. Sitharaman said in her Budget speech.

All these proposals will come into force immediately.

Further, to bolster the Indian start-up eco-system, boost the entrepreneurial spirit and support innovation, Ms. Sitharaman proposed to abolish the so-called angel tax for all classes of investors.

This was a proposal from the industry for a long time, and this announcement will drive more investments towards startups in particular. Startups function as engines of economic growth, playing a crucial role in generating new jobs, ideas, products, and services.

The move to abolish the Angel Tax also drew rare praise from the opposition. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said "" was pleased to hear that the finance minister will abolish the Angel Tax. Congress has pleaded for the abolition for many years and most recently in the Congress Manifesto on page 31"".

As per definition, angel tax refers to the income tax levied by the government on funding raised by unlisted companies, or startups, if their valuation exceeds the company's fair market value.

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: Standard deduction for salaried class increased from 50,000 to 75,000","In a bid to give a boost to salaried taxpayers, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday increased the Standard Deduction limit from 50,000 to 75,000. But the deduction is applicable only in the New Tax Regime, while its limit remains unchanged in the Old Tax Regime.

Commenting on the same, Adhil Shetty, CEO of Bankbazaar.com, said, “The Union Budget’s proposal to raise the standard tax deduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 is a crucial move to reduce the financial strain on taxpayers. This increase will offer greater relief by reducing taxable income, enabling taxpayers to save more and enhance their financial well-being. It is particularly advantageous for middle-income earners, as it boosts their disposable income and promotes savings and investment.”

Rahul Jain, President and Head, Nuvama Wealth, said, “The personal income tax in the new regime has seen two significant improvements. Initially, the standard deduction has been raised to Rs 75,000, marking a 50% increase. Additionally, the revision of three income slabs has been implemented. The new regime will result in reduced tax liability, potentially saving up to Rs 17,500, as mentioned in the budget speech. This will put more money in the hands of individuals, boosting personal consumption.”

It may be noted that the standard deduction is a set amount that can be claimed by employees without having to show proof of the actual expenses they have incurred. This deduction has a long history, having been available for many years before being eliminated in 2005, only to be reinstated in the 2018 Union Budget. Initially set at Rs 40,000 in the Budget 2018, the standard deduction was later raised to Rs 50,000 in the following Budget. This deduction was later introduced in the new tax regime in the Budget 2023.

Tax experts were of the opinion that the current standard deduction of Rs 50,000 might not be sufficient to cover the rising costs and expenses related to a higher standard of living. Therefore, there was a necessity to raise its limit. This adjustment would also create fairness with individuals earning income from business or profession, who have the option to claim actual expenses or choose a presumptive basis of taxation.

Additionally, following the pandemic, medical expenses had increased, which also needed to be taken into account when contemplating an increase in the standard deduction. To tackle these issues, there was a popular expectation for the standard deduction to be increased to Rs 1 lakh from the current limit of Rs 50,000.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-standard-deduction-for-salaried-class-increased-from-50000-to-75000-3560890/
thehindu.com,"Budget 2024: BJD flays Centre, says Odisha’s ‘special status’ demand ignored","The Biju Janata Dal has lashed out at the Narendra Modi government accusing that Odisha’s demand for special category State status has been overlooked in the Union Budget while crores of funds have been allocated for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar.

Reacting to the Budget, former Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said, “BJP had put special category status in their manifesto as a promise to the people of Odisha. However, this promise has not been considered for Odisha, whereas special packages, allocating crores of funds have been announced for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar.”

“Along with this, the demand of Odisha for revision of coal royalty, which has been pending for years with the central government, has been rejected, because of which the State will lose thousands of crores of revenue every year,” Mr. Patnaik charged, terming the Budget disappointing.

In sync with the party’s stand, all the BJD MPs in Rajya Sabha walked out of House when the Union Budget was being laid.

“Before Walking out, the BJD MPs strongly said in the House that they were walking out due to the denial of Special Category State status to Odisha. While Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar had been asking for the special category, the two states got Special additional funds while Odisha’s demand was not considered,” said BJD MP and party spokesperson Sasmit Patra.

He sarcastically said probably this was the punishment meted out to Odisha for electing 20 Lok Sabha BJP MPs out of 21 MPs from Odisha.

“Lots of big promises in different sectors were made to the people of Odisha during the election campaign especially on agriculture , MSME and industry. There is no mention of any promise being fulfilled in this Budget. This is a complete neglect of Odisha and her people,” the BJD supremo maintained.

Mr. Patnaik further said, “We all know that Odisha faces a number of natural disasters every year, including floods. We had requested for a special package for disaster management. While similar requests of other States have been considered and they have been granted special packages for flood protection, the genuine demand of Odisha on disaster management has not been considered.”

The former CM pointed out, “we have been fighting for Justice in the Polavaram issue. Allocating more and more funds for Polavaram without sorting out the genuine grievances of Odisha shows impartiality against Odisha.”

On the expected line, the State unit of Bharatiya Janata Party welcomed the budget saying it was progressive and aimed at achieving goal of Vikshit Bharat.

Deputy Chief Minister K.V. Singh Deo said, “When a 24-year-old government did not take any step to improve the tourism sector, the Central government’s specific announcement for Odisha’s tourism development should be welcomed. It will generate employment.”

“Whatever special assistance is required for Odisha has been granted through different infrastructure projects and national programmes. Odisha has got more than its due share,” Mr. Singh Deo said. The State government would take up the issue of submergence of localities in its Malkangiri district due to Polavaram project of Andhra Pradesh, he said.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-bjd-flays-centre-says-odishas-special-status-demand-ignored/article68437720.ece
thehindu.com,Budget 2024 for Women: ₹3 lakh crore for schemes benefiting women and girls,"The first Union budget of the Modi 3.0 government saw a concerted effort at women-led development, with the Finance Minister announcing more than ₹3 lakh crore for schemes benefiting women and girls, and promised a look at further lowering duties for properties purchased by women.

She also announced a new pension scheme named ‘Vatsalya’. A contributory pension scheme, this will have contributions from parents and guardians. On the child attaining the age of majority, the plan can be converted seamlessly into a regular National Pension System (NPS) account.

Other announcements include the setting up of special working women’s hostels and creches in collaboration with industries to facilitate women’s employment, and promoting women-specific skilling programmes and support for women’s self help groups.

According to an analysis by The Hindu’s data team, the allocation for the Ministry of Women and Child Development has actually seen a dip, though very marginal, of 0.03%. While the budget estimate for FY25 is ₹26,092 crore, the revised estimate in FY24 was ₹25,448 crore.

The allocations for schemes coming under the Women and Child Development (WCD) Ministry, including ‘Samarthya’ (supporting projects such as women’s hostels), ‘Swadhar Greh’, and ‘Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana’, have also been increased slightly.

A significant portion of the WCD Ministry’s budget is directed towards Centrally-sponsored schemes, which received ₹25,848 crore.

The flagship schemes under the Ministry, including ‘Saksham Anganwadi’, POSHAN 2.0, Mission Vatsalya and Mission Shakti, have been given substantial funds to continue their efforts in improving nutrition, child protection, and women’s empowerment.

What activists really find encouraging though are the doubling of the upper limit of Mudra loans to ₹20 lakh to promote entrepreneurship in the country as, according to them, nearly 60% of entrepreneurs in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector are women, and they are desperately in need of formal loans.

The credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs is also likely to be benificial for women, they feel.

“The MSME sector has the maximum number of women who struggle to get collateral-free loans. These efforts made in the Union budget would be hugely beneficial to them as we have observed in our work with communities,” Kalpana Ajayan, regional head, South Asia, Women’s World Banking, and Member, Gender Committee, Reserve Bank Innovation Hub, said.

thehindu.com,Budget 2024 for Tamil Nadu: Union Budget a mixed bag with no specific announcements,"The Union Budget 2024-25 was a mixed bag for Tamil Nadu with no specific announcements, while broader measures such as the employment incentive scheme are likely to benefit the State.

Ahead of the Budget, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin presented a wish list of projects for Tamil Nadu, including funds for the Chennai Metro Rail Phase 2, and an elevated expressway between Tambaram and Chengalpattu. At a pre-Budget meeting, State Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu had sought funds for flood relief. None of these found a mention in the Budget speech.

Tamil Nadu’s share of Central taxes is 4.079%, as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission. The amount has been revised upwards from ₹49,754.95 crore to ₹50,873.76 crore in the Union Budget.

The DMK government has pointed out that the State has been getting a much lower share of Central taxes due to the levy of cesses and surcharges. The State government has requested the Union government to merge the cesses and surcharges into the basic rates of taxation, saying the move would ensure that the States receive their legitimate share in devolution.

The announcement of five schemes and initiatives to facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities and support MSMEs would benefit Tamil Nadu, which is a highly industrialised State and has the highest number of factories.

Tamil Nadu is a top market for education loans, and the announcement of financial support for loans of up to ₹10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions is likely to benefit the State.

The announcement that the Centre will encourage States that charge a high stamp duty to moderate the rates for all, and also consider lowering the duties for properties purchased by women, if implemented, would benefit homebuyers in Tamil Nadu.

Tamil Nadu is also among the top States in terms of Mudra loans, and the announcement that the limit of the loans will be increased from ₹10 lakh to ₹20 lakh for entrepreneurs who have availed themselves of, and successfully repaid, previous loans under the ‘Tarun’ category would also benefit the State.

The reduced customs duties on gold and silver are also likely to benefit customers in the State.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/union-budget-a-mixed-bag-for-tamil-nadu/article68437276.ece
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: Tax slab changes, Standard Deduction hike to Rs 75K enhance New Tax Regime’s appeal among taxpayers","As widely expected, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech on Tuesday proposed some changes in the New Tax Regime to enhance its appeal among taxpayers. First, Standard Deduction for salaried employees was proposed to be increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000, while deduction on family pension for pensioners was increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000.

Apart from this, tax slabs under the new tax regime were proposed to be simplified, which will encourage more taxpayers to switch from the Old Tax Regime.

Commenting on this, Adhil Shetty, CEO of Bankbazaar.com, said, “The Union Budget 2024-25 has further simplified the tax slabs under the new tax regime, encouraging more taxpayers to switch from the old regime, which still attracts a large percentage due to its wider deductions for various financial investments.”

The revised tax slabs are as follows: those earning Rs 3-7 lakh will pay 5%, while income between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 10 lakh will be taxed at 10%. Similarly, one will have to pay 15% tax on income between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, while income from Rs 12-15 lakh will fall under the 20% tax slab, and those earning above Rs 15 lakh will be taxed at 30%.

Additionally, the standard deduction has been increased, allowing taxpayers to save approximately Rs 17,500 more under the new regime.

“The simplified tax structure aims to make the new tax regime more attractive by reducing complexity and potentially lowering the tax burden for middle-income earners. By setting lower rates for intermediate income brackets, the government is addressing a key concern that has kept many taxpayers in the old regime—its extensive deductions and exemptions,” added Shetty.

It may be noted that the New Tax Regime, introduced in the Budget 2020 with altered tax slabs and concessional tax rates but minimal exemptions and deductions from income, was supposed to herald a new era for India in the field of taxation. However, it failed to take off owing to low interest of taxpayers.

In a bid to increase its adoption rate among taxpayers, several changes were made in this regime in the Budget 2023. For example, the rebate limit was increased to Rs 7 lakh from Rs 5 lakh earlier, and the number of slabs were reduced from 6 to 5, while the tax exemption limit was increased to Rs 3 lakh.

The New Regime was also made the default option. Still, compared to the old regime, the new regime was less popular among taxpayers because of not giving them many options to make tax-saving investments.

Tax experts, therefore, wanted the government to contemplate raising the basic exemption limit in the New Tax Regime from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, and tax rebate from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh. They also suggested to impose the 30% tax rate at an income of Rs 20 lakh or Rs 25 lakh, rather than the current Rs 15 lakh, making the tax system more equitable.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-tax-slab-changes-standard-deduction-hike-to-rs-75k-enhance-new-tax-regimes-appeal-among-taxpayers-3560903/

Union Budget 2024 Date and Time

The Union Budget is all set to be presented tomorrow at 11 AM. It will be presented by BJP leader Nirmala Sitharaman, who holds the finance portfolio, in the Lok Sabha. The Union Budget 2024, like recent full Union Budgets, will be presented in a paperless format. This year 2024, when Lok Sabha elections are held, will have two budgets: an interim one presented in February and a full budget, which will be presented tomorrow.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Switching tax regimes to be allowed for all? Experts seek a more taxpayer-friendly system,"Ahead of the Union Budget 2024, tax experts have called for a more flexible tax system, urging the government to allow all taxpayers the option to switch between tax regimes.

They argue that this change in taxation policy would help taxpayers plan their investments in a better manner, ultimately leading to a more taxpayer-friendly system. If the government allows taxpayers this flexibility, this would promote fairness and efficiency in the tax framework.

Who can switch personal income tax regimes in India?

Earlier, when the new tax regime was introduced there was no restriction on how many times one can change tax regime, irrespective of the status of the taxpayer. Both non-salaried and salaried taxpayers were allowed to change the tax regime next year from the other regime they opted in that particular financial year.

However, now only individual and HUF taxpayers have the option to choose between the old and new tax regimes on a year-by-year basis. Those earning income from business or profession who opt out of the current new tax regime under Section 115 BAC can only return to it once.

This restriction places diligent and compliant professionals at a significant disadvantage. Consequently, it is expected that the Union Budget 2024 will introduce greater flexibility, allowing professionals to switch between the old and new tax regimes on an annual basis, say experts.

Union Budget 2023: Key Changes in Tax Regime Switching Rules

In the Union Budget 2023, the government introduced significant changes to the rules for switching income tax regimes. One major update was designating the new tax regime as the default option if a taxpayer does not specify their preference. Additionally, individuals with business income and non-salaried professionals are now permitted to switch their tax regime only once. This means that if they opt for the new tax system, they will not be able to revert to the old regime.

Taxpayers earning income from a business or profession are restricted to changing tax regimes only once. They have the option to switch between the old and new regimes during ITR filing. To make this transition, they must submit Form 10-IE along with their ITR.

What is Form 10IE?

Taxpayers — whether individuals or HUFs — with business or professional income are required to file Form 10-IE when opting for the new tax regime. This form serves as a declaration of your switch to the new regime and must be submitted before filing your ITR. By completing this form, you notify the Income-Tax Department of your updated tax regime choice.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-switching-tax-regimes-to-be-allowed-for-all-experts-seek-a-more-taxpayer-friendly-system-3560757/
ndtv.com,Union Budget 2024: Experts Urge Centre To Remove 18% GST On Mental Health Services,"Lack of mental health professionals is crippling in India, an expert said.

The government must remove or limit the 18 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) on mental health services, and allocate resources strategically to help India become a mentally resilient society, experts said on the eve of the Union Budget presentation on Monday.

Mental health is a key area of concern that can have a significant impact on the productivity and economy of the country.

""Mental health issues are highly prevalent, yet are poorly managed and are affecting a significant number of our population. In the upcoming Budget, we urge the government to remove or reduce the 18 per cent GST on mental health services,"" Jyoti Kapoor, Founder & Director of Manasthali Wellness, told IANS.

According to experts, with declining mental health, there has been an increase in the need for health insurance policies that cover both physical and mental health.

Unfortunately, people are not reporting these conditions as the cost of the available medications and therapies often proves challenging.

Divya Mohindroo, counselling psychologist, highlighted the need for comprehensive policies to handle India's mental health crisis and the need to increase the workforce in the sector.

""Out of an estimated 150 million people needing mental health services, only fewer than 30 million seek help,"" Mohindroo told IANS.

""Lack of mental health professionals is crippling in India, with merely 0.3 psychiatrists, 0.07 psychologists, and 0.07 social workers available per 100,000 people,"" she added.

""There should be specific measures for mental health, and we are hopeful the Budget will prioritise this urgent issue. There is an immediate need to strengthen India's mental health workforce, with just one psychiatrist per two lakh people,"" Mohindroo said.

She also suggested ""scholarships to train professionals to help reduce this gap"".

The experts also suggested incorporating mental health services into healthcare insurance coverage.

""While government centres receive some relief, private practitioners are left burdened. Extending tax benefits to private practitioners is crucial, given the high operational costs for the average therapist. In addition to acknowledging the financial difficulties experienced by private practitioners, this change would help lower the cost and increase public accessibility to mental health care,"" Kapoor said.

""This will help our citizens access mental healthcare without burdening them financially,"" added Mohindroo.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Expectations of the Automotive and Technology Industry,"By- Neelesh Talathi

Envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Viksit Bharat 2047 sets an ambitious roadmap for India’s transformation into a developed nation by its centenary of independence. This vision aims to elevate India’s economic, social, and environmental standing on the global stage. With a GDP growth of 7.6% in FY 2023-24, India has become the world’s fifth-largest economy. Contributing 16% to global growth in 2023, India is now playing a significant role on the world stage.

The Automotive Sector

The automotive industry has a 7.1% contribution to India’s GDP. The sector’s impact extends beyond economic figures, with a significant contribution in creating employment. As we approach the Union Budget 2024, there are clear expectations for further support to innovation and competitiveness in the auto industry.

Make India Prima-Donna of FDI Inflows: India is the world’s 3rd largest automobile market with a substantive consumption domestically and enjoying a 4.7% share in Indian exports. This is on the back of strong domestic demand, well-developed component manufacturing eco-system, and policy support from the Government of India. The sector has attracted cumulative equity foreign investment of US$ 35.40 billion between April 2000 and September 2023. Opportunity remains to make India the global leader in shared mobility by 2030, to gain leadership in heavy truck manufacturing (presently 3rd largest) & car (from #4), and drive the next wave of development on Electrical Vehicles. Of this only to meet India’s EV ambition by 2030 calls for an investment of US$180bn.

The automotive industry expects stepped-up momentum in creating a conducive environment to boost Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows. These measures could include greater allocation to the automobile industry under the PLI schemes, tax benefits linked to investment for EV and employment, and measures to streamline approval processes to enhance the ease of doing business.

Winning in India’s EV Sector: India has made international commitments to reduce economy-wide emission intensity by 45% below 2005 levels by 2030. Further, Indian imports on account of oil add up to around US$ 100bn. A shift to Electrical Vehicles is not merely a solution to these challenges but also an opportunity to gain global leadership in a relatively nascent and fast-growing industry.

With an EV penetration rate at under 1%, many factors need to come together to address the key blockers which according to a study by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minster (EAC-PM) include high cost, range anxiety, limited model options and unknow resale value. While winning in Electrical Vehicles is admittedly not only going to be about budgetary support it is noteworthy that between 2009-2022 the Chinese Government poured US$29Bn into subsidies and tax breaks for Chinese EV manufacturers.

In this budget the automobile industry would like for the Honorable Finance Minister to focus on facilitating creating charging infrastructure (India needs 1.3Mn vs around 13000 presently), Tax Rebates on leasing of Electrical Vehicles (solution for concerns on resale value) and mandate all new procurement by the government to be only electrical vehicles. What better way of persuading the common man than to follow our own leaders?

Innovation and R&D: Research and Development (R&D) investments are crucial for the success of the ‘Make in India’ campaign and for keeping India competitive on the global stage. The Union Budget 2023 underscored the importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by announcing the establishment of three ‘Centres of Excellence’ for AI to enable ‘Make AI for India’ and ‘Make AI Work for India’. Budget 2024 is expected to further boost R&D initiatives, particularly in areas such as advanced batteries, electric vehicles, and connected infrastructure. This focus on innovation will be key to driving technological advancements and fostering an environment of continuous improvement.

Enable Start-ups to disrupt more: Numerous innovations & disruptions have been germinated by our start-up industry in the automobile sector including strides being made in autonomous cars, hi-tech low-cost solutions to battery charging, affordable mobility solutions, Artificial Intelligence (AI) in consumer discovery and data-based solutions on financing, insurance, etc.

India today ranks in the 40th position in the Global Innovation Index 2023; with the brain pool that India has, we should be aspiring to be in the Top 10. While we have successfully created a vibrant entrepreneurial fraternity there is more that needs to be done to unshackle the willingness to take risk. Trapping like “Angel Tax” (Sec 56(2) (viib) of Income Tax Act) needs to be urgently undone and the budget should set out a clear message about fostering trust between the Tax administrators and the Taxpayers. According to data from PrivateCircle Research as reported by Hindu Business Line, former employees of just one successful Indian start-up have founded around 44 start-ups with a cumulative valuation of US$25Bn (as of Feb 24).

If steps are taken in this budget to remove dual taxation on ESOP (presently suffers both Perquisite Tax and Capital Gain Tax) it will put more money in the hands of younger Indians to convert their ideas into viable ventures, paving the way for India’s aspiration to be in the Top10 in the Global Innovation Index.

As concluding remarks and to steal a line from the auto industry, in an otherwise bumpy global doom & gloom, the Indian economy is very much on an auto-cruise mode. We hope to see Union Budget 2024 clear all roadblocks and provide the rocket fuel to accelerate our leap towards Viksit Bharat.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Realtors want Govt to focus on ways to propel housing demand further,"The real estate sector has played a key role in shaping India’s economic growth. The sector not just generates substantial employment opportunities but also brings in a lot of foreign and domestic investment. The demand for housing, offices, retail, warehousing etc. is not limited to India’s metros but also tier 2 and 3 cities that have been playing an important role with their robust connectivity and infrastructure developments.

According to a report by data analytics firm PropEquity, housing transactions in the top 30 Tier II cities rose by 11% year-on-year to almost 2.08 lakh units in the previous fiscal year due to strong consumer demand fueled by solid economic expansion, infrastructure enhancements, and increasing aspiration for property ownership. Data indicates that housing unit sales in India’s 30 key Tier II cities reached 2.07 lakh units in 2023-24, up from 1.86 lakh units in the previous financial year. Interestingly, the data showed that out of these 30 cities, the top 10 cities contributed 80% to the total sales. Housing sales in India’s top seven cities continue to be robust.

To keep this momentum going, real estate developers believe the Budget 2024 must focus on propelling this demand further.

Samir Jasuja, Founder and CEO of PropEquity said, “Increasing the interest deduction limit under Section 24B of the Income Tax Act would allow homeowners to claim a higher amount of interest paid on their home loans as a tax deduction, potentially providing significant tax relief. The single-window clearance system aims to consolidate all development authorities under one roof, ensuring timely approvals for real estate projects.”

Vivek Singhal, CEO Smartworld Developers said, “Positive outlook is being observed regarding upcoming policy adjustments, including possible decreases in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates and initiatives to stabilize material costs. A significant advancement could come from the complete exemption of interest paid on home loans under section 24, surpassing the current cap of Rs 2 lakh, and the increase in the standard deduction limit under section 80C, which could result in a higher amount of disposable income for consumers. Furthermore, there are hopes for tax benefits and expanded deduction limits on home loans.”

The real estate industry has demonstrated remarkable resilience amidst a global economic downturn and increasing input expenses, thereby sustaining the balance between demand and supply.

“However, the industry should be acknowledged for its role in driving economic growth, generating employment, and developing top-notch infrastructure by implementing tax cuts and adjusting GST input tax credit regulations to lower property costs and boost demand in all types of assets. Additionally, the longstanding request of granting industry status to the sector should be prioritized to support the government’s goal of providing housing for all and reaching a $5-trillion economy by 2025,” said Angad Bedi, MD, BCD Group.

Mohit Malhotra, Founder & CEO, NeoLiv said, “Our primary focus is on the mid-housing segment, which is crucial for us. We expect that this will lead to the emergence of fresh development prospects due to higher budget allocations for infrastructure. This, in turn, will make it more convenient to reach city centers, which is vital for mid-range housing initiatives aimed at meeting the requirements of the middle-income population. We are eager for the budget to acknowledge the future possibilities within this segment. We are optimistic that it will encompass measures to empower emerging developers with strong financial backing and clear-cut policies, thus nurturing the expansion of the housing industry in the nation.”

“It is imperative for the government to consider increasing the cap on interest payment deductions for home loans from the current Rs 2 lakh annually to Rs 5 lakh. This move would significantly boost housing demand, particularly in light of the significant surge in housing prices and mortgage rates in the last 1-2 years,” said Vijay Harsh Jha, founder and CEO, VS Realtors (I) Pvt Ltd, a Gurugram-based property brokerage firm.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-realtors-want-govt-to-focus-on-ways-to-propel-housing-demand-further-3560177/

Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty experienced minor gains last week, extending their winning streak to seven weeks. However, a sharp decline in the previous session erased most of the weekly gains. On Friday, investors rushed to book profits following four days of record-breaking rallies and a global sell-off triggered by an IT outage causing widespread device crashes.

The rally in benchmark indices last week was driven by IT stocks, buoyed by strong Q1FY25 performance and expectations of a US Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Notably, the BSE benchmark hit the 81,000-mark for the first time on Thursday.

“Markets experienced profit-taking and shed nearly a percent, erasing the gains of the previous trading session. After a flat start, the Nifty gradually declined throughout the day, ultimately closing near the day’s low at 24,530.90 level. Most sectors ended lower, with metals, realty, and energy being the top losers. The broader indices also faced pressure, dropping over 2% each,” said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Smarter tax for smarter tech,"– By Naveen Aggarwal

India’s technology sector continues to demonstrate resilience amidst weaker global contracts, subdued hiring activities and clampdown on discretionary spend. With AI / GenAI taking center stage, there is increasing emphasis on areas such as semiconductors, data processing, cybersecurity, blockchain, amongst others. The sector expects this year’s budget to bring the much-needed reforms that will help unleash the next phase of exponential growth.

More legroom on Safe Harbors

Safe harbor provisions provide certainty and relief from rigorous tax scrutiny to taxpayers complying with specified conditions. The margin rate currently prescribed for IT and routine software development services is 17-18% for international transactions up to INR 200 crores. This is higher than the comparable benchmark and commercially unviable for taxpayers to adopt, thus the need to revisit the current margin rates and align it with global trends.

Additionally, the present threshold of INR 200 crores eliminates several medium sized companies and almost all the large companies from purview of safe harbour provisions, as the international transactions undertaken will likely surpass the limit. To augment a more comprehensive regime, the government should consider abolishing the threshold or increasing it to at least INR 1,000 crore, and also bringing in routine engineering design transactions also within the ambit, which will help attract fresh investments in the sector.

Fast tracking Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)

The average timeline to conclude APAs’ in India is 4-5 years and, in many cases, get concluded post expiry of the period sought to be covered under the APA. During the period when APA is under negotiation, taxpayers are subjected to regular transfer pricing audits. There is a need to prescribe a timeline for concluding the same, including introducing a mechanism to fast-track processing of renewal applications as well as APAs’ for standard transactions, simplifying the compliances and holding regular audit proceedings in abeyance till APA process is ongoing. This will make the APA route more attractive and provide a predictable tax regime for technology companies with growing India interest.

Driving certainty on Significant Economic Presence (SEP) and Equalization Levy (EL)

Despite being a frontrunner in introducing these measures to tax the digital economy, ambiguities remain around its scope and compliance remit. Clarity is required around aspects such as its interplay with royalty, fee for technical services (FTS) transactions and attribution of profits in respect of SEP, etc. The expectation is that this year’s budget will likely refine these SEP provisions / guidelines to ensure that digital businesses are taxed fairly.

On EL, a critical ask is that the levy deposited should be allowed to be adjusted against the income tax liability in case of subsequent Permanent Establishment (PE) determination or Royalty/ FTS characterization. With EL here to stay, considering the uncertainty around ratification of BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Pillar One, an appeal mechanism for EL related disputes will help bring stability in the tax ecosystem.

Defined roadmap on implementation of BEPS Pillar Two

The sector, with its international operations and intricate value chains, is expected to get impacted by the global tax deal on BEPS. Several countries such as UK, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, members of the European Union, amongst others have already adopted or looking to adopt BEPS Pillar Two. Therefore, a clear roadmap towards its implementation, which aims to deter profit shifting by setting a minimum effective tax rate of 15% for large multinationals, will be essential for companies to plan and comply effectively.

Relief from TCS on ESOPs

Pursuant to the recent amendments in overseas investment and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) regulations, remittance in respect of ESOPs issued by foreign entities to Indian subsidiary’s employees are covered within the LRS limit and potentially subject to TCS at 20%. While employees can claim credit in their income-tax returns, such TCS has a significant cash-flow impact. Remittance in respect of stock plans is out of the employees’ tax paid salary and the perquisite component is also tracked under the withholding tax provisions. There is therefore a need to provide relief from applicability of TCS on ESOPs and similar plans to help maintain their attractiveness as an employee retention tool.

Adding thrust to Make in India

One expects the PLI to get extended to newer sectors that involve manufacturing across hi-tech products, consumer and industrial electronics, computers, etc., bolstering domestic production and attracting investments. Growing sectors such as space, drones, in fact the growing tech startups, would greatly benefit from this fillip and keep the momentum going on the ‘Make in India’ sentiment.

No surprises, the tech sector will play the anchor role in India’s $10 Tn journey, given its heft in driving innovation, drawing investments and employment generation. One is hopeful that this budget sets the tone for a transformative growth led agenda for this sector to help build a globally competitive business ecosystem in the time to come.

Will FM Sitharaman deliver?,"8th Pay Commission: As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present her 7th Union Budget on July 23, expectations are running high among government employees that the FM would announce the 8th Pay Commission in her budget speech. Over 49 lakh central government employees and 67 lakh pensioners are eagerly waiting for the Modi government to announce setting up the 8th Pay Commission.

In recent times, several bodies and unions representing central government employees have submitted proposals to the Centre on the 8th Pay Commission, the restoration of the old pension scheme, and the release of 18 months’ dearness allowance arrears.

FM Sitharaman may make a major announcement regarding the establishment of the 8th Pay Commission in tomorrow’s budget, according to reports.

Central govt employees and advisory councils press for 8th Pay Commission formation

Central government employees have consistently pressed for the formation of the 8th Pay Commission through various forums. Numerous employee committees have repeatedly urged the central government to establish the 8th Pay Commission to revise basic salaries, allowances, pensions, and other benefits.

In a recent letter to the Cabinet Secretary of the Government of India, SB Yadav, General Secretary of the Employees Federation, called for the creation of the 8th Pay Commission, the restoration of the old pension scheme, the release of 18 months’ dearness allowance, and additional relief for employees and pensioners.

The National Council of Joint Advisory Machinery has also echoed the demand for the formation of the 8th Pay Commission. General Secretary C. Srikumar has confirmed that this request will be formally presented to the central government.

However, it’s important to note that the Modi government has not yet officially announced the establishment of the 8th Pay Commission, and no specific implementation date has been set. Typically, it takes around 12 to 18 months for a pay commission to formulate its recommendations after being established. During this period, the commission evaluates various factors, including current economic conditions, to propose adjustments to employee salaries and benefits.

Central govt employees demand increase in Fitment Factor from 2.57 to 3.68

Central government employees have been advocating for an increase in the fitment factor from 2.57 to 3.68. The fitment factor is a key multiplier used to calculate salaries and pensions for government employees. For example, the 2.57 fitment factor was applied when revising salaries from the 6th Central Pay Commission to the 7th Pay Commission.

The 6th Pay Commission proposed a fitment factor of 1.86, while the 7th Pay Commission set the factor at 2.57. This adjustment raised the minimum basic pay for central government employees to Rs 18,000 per month, up from Rs 7,000, reflecting a 2.57-fold increase from the previous commission. Employees are now urging the government to elevate the fitment factor to 3.68 to further enhance their salaries and benefits.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-govt-employees-await-big-announcement-on-8th-pay-commission-formation-will-fm-sitharaman-deliver-3560908/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: Centre vs State spending on education,"In the 2023 budget, the Ministry of Education was allocated Rs 1,12,899 crore, marking a 13 percent increase. This amount constitutes 2.9 percent of the central government’s overall estimated expenditure for FY24. However, the share of education spending in the aggregate expenditure of states and Union Territories (UTs) has been declining over the past decade. For the current financial year, 27 out of the 31 states and UTs have budgeted a lower proportion of expenditure on education compared to the average spending during the pre-pandemic period (FY16-20). “Considering that state budgets account for 60% of the net expenditure of the government in India, an increment in a state’s spending on education would be massively beneficial in enhancing the state’s landscape, and the overall improvement of education and literacy rates at the national level,” Chandrakant Patil, Minister of Higher and Technical Education, Maharashtra, told the financialexpress.com.

Patil further suggested that it is also important to not just focus on allocations as a headline number, but rather also look at the policies which are being unveiled by the Government to effectively channelize the allocations.

In FY24, an average of 14.7 percent of the budget of Indian states was allocated to education. The majority of funding for government schools comes from state governments, while the central government contributes through programmes such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), Teacher Education (TE), and mid-day meals. “Each state has unique priorities influenced by factors like demographics and socioeconomic barriers. Consequently, some states allocate more to their budgets, while others tailor their allocations to specific needs. States with established infrastructure and stable student enrolment require lower education funding, whereas those revamping their education systems allocate higher amounts to build capacity,” Praneet Mungali, Secretary, Sanskriti Group of Schools, Pune, said.

Public expenditure on education in India has been increasing annually since 2013. In 2022, an estimated RS 757,000 crore was spent by both the central and state governments. However, it is still very less from the recommended figure by the National Education Policy. The policy recommended that India allocate at least 6% of its GDP to education. However, actual public expenditure has remained around 2.8% of GDP. More than 85% of public education spending is covered by state governments. In 2022-23, states are estimated to bear 89.3% of the total education expenditure, while the central government contributes 10.7% through specific programmess. “Since the introduction of GST, revenue collection by states and UTs has fluctuated, leading to an unbalanced division of tax revenue and impacting overall expenditure. Additionally, vast demographics affect state education budgets, as some states classify spending on schools for certain castes (SC/ST) as welfare rather than education expenditure, creating an illusion of inadequate education funding,” Mungali explained.

In 2022-23, the central budget for education is projected to fall short by Rs 7,100 crore, or 7% less than planned. Reports indicate that the gap between budgeted and actual expenditure has been widening since 2017, increasing from a 5.5% shortfall in 2017-18 to 7% in 2022-23. Conversely, state budgets are expected to exceed their planned education spending by 2.1% in 2022-23.

In 2022-23, total public education expenditure (central and state) is estimated to be 9.5% of combined central and state expenditures, down from 11.6% in 2013-14. The central government’s share is estimated at 2.3% of its total expenditure, while states are projected to spend 13% of their total expenditures on education. Delhi leads with 21.1% of its total expenditure allocated to education, followed by Bihar at 19.7%. In contrast, Telangana and Manipur have the lowest percentages, at 6.8% and 7.6%, respectively. “It is important to recognise that while we should always look for growth in budgets, it is equally significant to have a greater focus towards policies formalised to channelise the budgets and ensuring the overall utilisation of budgets,” Patil suggested.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budgetnbsp-2024-expectations-cantre-vs-state-spending-on-educationnbsp-3561330/
financialexpress.com,How Budget 2024 can influence Consumer Behavior in India,"– By Saket Gaurav

The Union Budget 2024 holds promise to steer India towards a high-growth trajectory. India’s economic progress can be shaped by implementing key changes in policies and reforms focused on industrial growth, particularly in consumer durables. Strategic changes, discussed below, can have a profound effect on consumer behavior across the country.

A lower tax rate or increased tax exemptions can lead to more disposable income for individuals, which will increase consumer expenditures, particularly in the consumer durables sector. Increased disposable money can drive sales of smartwatches and smart TVs as individuals feel safer and tend to spend more on leisure and health-related goods.

Subsidies and Incentives

In addition to subsidies and incentives available currently, consumers who buy electric vehicles or install solar power plants should receive additional benefits. These provisions will encourage more consumers to make eco-friendly choices, ultimately benefiting the environment.

Economic Growth Projections

The Union Budget 2024 should bring a holistic approach towards benefiting the economy. A thriving economy boosts consumers' confidence in their financial stability, encouraging them to invest in durable goods. This greater confidence frequently leads to higher purchases of products such as air conditioners, refrigerators, and other household appliances. As consumer spending rises significantly, it benefits both manufacturers and retailers.

Inflation Control Measures

We anticipate certain inflation-control measures this year from the budget that would stabilize prices and make commodities more affordable to end customers. When inflation is kept under control, purchasing power rises, allowing customers to spend more on their lifestyle. This may result in increased demand for consumer durables, as steady pricing makes these items more accessible to a larger audience.

Employment Generation Schemes

A number of special reforms for generating employment are expected in Budget 2024. Higher employment rates imply that more people have consistent incomes, which leads to increased spending power. As people strive to better their quality of life, they frequently increase their expenditure on lifestyle and durable goods.

Support for MSMEs and Startups

The rising pool of MSMEs and startups has the potential to significantly impact the Indian economy. When small and medium-sized businesses grow, consumers benefit from greater choice and variety. This promotes competition and innovation, which leads to improved products and services for customers. Encouraging the expansion of MSMEs and startups can result in a more dynamic and consumer-friendly market environment.

Infrastructure Development

Improved infrastructure, such as better roads and transportation networks, improves market access, making it easier for customers to buy goods and services. This benefits local economies while also increasing the consumer base for a variety of products, including consumer durables.

Digital India Initiatives

Digital India signifies a huge advancement in India’s economic development. Promoting e-commerce and digital payments through policies and improvements that promote Digital India, such as the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), can significantly impact consumer behavior. As more people shop online, the demand for digital payment solutions and e-commerce platforms increases. This change, aided by efforts such as ONDC, may result in an increase in online transactions, helping companies that adapt swiftly to digital trends.

Agricultural Reforms

The next wave of buyers will be from rural India. Special arrangements to promote rural incomes can lead to increased sales of consumer durables from rural areas. Consumers in rural areas are more likely to invest in improving their level of living if they have some discretionary income.

Healthcare Investments

Lower healthcare costs, such as reduced GST rates for health insurance, can allow individuals to spend more on lifestyle items and consumer durables. This can lead to greater demand for a wide range of items, which helps to boost overall economic growth.

Education and Skill Development Programs

Education and skill development initiatives increase career prospects, resulting in increased incomes for individuals. Consumers are more inclined to spend on education-related items and services as their career prospects improve and their wages rise. This can increase demand for smartwatches, computers, and other instructional tools, boosting the consumer durables industry.

As we anticipate these changes, businesses must adjust and align their strategy to meet the changing needs of consumers in this dynamic market climate.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Juggernaut keeps rolling,"– By Gaurav Mehndiratta and Palav Shah

With the Modi government embarking on its third term, the nation is standing at the cusp of unprecedented growth and transformation. The government’s continued commitment to driving growth and innovation should propel India towards a path of sustained progress and global influence thereby making it a dynamic investment destination poised to lead on the world stage amid global uncertainty.

The past ten years of the Modi Government have been focused on economic growth, digital initiatives, infrastructure development, transparency, and efficiency in tax administration.

As India marches towards the vision of becoming a 5 trillion US dollar economy by 2026, the Union Budget of 2024 set on the anvil in July is an opportune time for the Modi government to formulate policies and provide tax incentives that boost and accelerate growth, attract foreign investment, and create a tax friendly climate.

Backed by a politically stable environment, the corporate sector key wishlist encapsulated below is that the Budget 2024 will shape the landscape for a diverse array of sectors and bring in a new wave of fervent optimism to steer the country’s trajectory forward.

Extension of deadline for concessional corporate tax rate under Section 115BAB for new manufacturing companies

The sunset date of 31 March 2024 for concessional corporate tax rate of 15 percent available to new domestic manufacturing companies to be extended for at least five years to incentivize domestic production, reduce dependency on imports, boost investments both by foreign and Indian players into India and create more jobs and improve India’s manufacturing eco-system overall. The ambit of the concessional rate to be extended to certain other activities such as research and development, software development, data processing, production of films or testing services and be included in the list of qualifying businesses eligible for the concessional corporate tax rate to boost the SME sector.

Dispute Resolution and Fast tracking of CIT(A) Appeals

To augment the vision of reducing tax litigation, an additional amnesty scheme Vivad se Vishwas Scheme 2.0 be re-introduced to significantly reduce the back log of pending litigation. It is expected that the government introduces a comprehensive policy framework for reducing the pendency of CIT(A) by providing timelines by which the appeals should be disposed off and designing a framework for clubbing of pending appeals for same assessee having similar issues for different assessment years, disposing off high stake matters involving 10 crore or more on priority and matters involving 50 crore and above be directly taken up at the Tribunal level.

BEPS 2.0 – Minimum Corporate Tax Rules under ‘Pillar 2’

BEPS 2.0 – a significant development in the realm of international taxation, is an initiative by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. It aims to ensure that the multinational enterprises (MNEs) pay their fair share of taxes across tax jurisdictions.

Anticipations for the upcoming Budget revolve around the Government providing a roadmap for implementation of the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (GloBe Rules) under the Two-Pillar Solution with respect to Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up tax, Under-taxed Payment Rule in the domestic tax laws of India for MNEs operating in India.

It is also expected that India would implement the concept of Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) by participation in the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) which enables the source jurisdiction to levy a top up withholding tax if the residence country’s effective income tax rate on specified income categories falls below 9 percent.

One will also need to watch out whether post introduction of Pillar Two reforms, unilateral measures introduced by India such as Equalisation Levy (EL) and Significant Economic Presence (SEP) to tax digital businesses are phased out or not.

India-Mauritius protocol

In light of Action 6 of the BEPS Inclusive Framework, India and Mauritius signed a protocol amending the India-Mauritius Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) introducing the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) in the Preamble to the DTAA. The PPT provides that DTAA benefit will not be granted if it is reasonable to conclude that obtaining such benefit was one of the principal purposes. The said protocol has raised a plethora of questions regarding the investments made by various overseas companies in the past. Clarity with respect to the ‘retrospective’ applicability of the protocol and taxability of capital gains with respect to investments made prior to 1 April 2017 and, whether any grandfathering clause will be introduced to safeguard the investors interests are awaited and it is expected that both the countries will issue guidelines once the protocol is ratified and made effective.

Cross border mergers

Corporate and regulatory laws in India now permit both inbound and outbound mergers pursuant to globalization and digitalization of businesses and free flows of capital and labor supporting enterprise. However, outbound mergers are generally less attractive as they are time consuming and tax neutrality is not available as in the case of inbound mergers. Inbound mergers are tax neutral i.e., not subjected to capital gains tax under Section 47. Similar tax neutrality should be extended to outbound mergers as well to provide impetus to outbound mergers.

The above reforms/ clarifications should boost investor confidence by making India as a preferred investment destination hub, considering most overseas countries are keen on evaluating and following China plus one strategy which should in turn foster economic growth and ensure fiscal sustainability for India.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: 50% of last-drawn salary as pension for govt employees? Will Budget settle OPS Vs NPS debate?,"Union Budget 2024: For years, central government employees who joined central services, except armed forces, before 2004 have been demanding restoration of the Old Pension Scheme (OPS), which was replaced by the National Pension System back then.

Ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25, the Modi government has received several proposals to scrap the NPS and bring back the OPS for employees of various government services.

Also Read India Budget 2024 Live Updates: Nirmala Sitharaman to present Union Budget in Lok Sabha shortly

Amid growing demands for the restoration of the OPS, the Modi government is expected to approve a proposal on guaranteed pension for central government employees, if not fully scrapping the NPS. Various media reports indicate that Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman may announce in her Budget 2024 speech a guarantee of 50% of employees’ last-drawn salary as pension under the NPS, which replaced OPS.

Union Budget 2024: Will OPS Vs NPS debate continue or get settled?

Under the Old Pension Scheme, retired government employees receive a lifelong pension equivalent to 50% of their final salary, adjusted periodically based on pay commission recommendations. As a ‘defined benefit’ plan, the OPS guarantees a fixed pension amount without requiring employee contributions during their service.

In contrast, the NPS operates as a ‘defined contribution’ scheme. Central government employees contribute 10% of their basic salary, while the government adds 14%. Pensions under the NPS are contingent on the accumulated contributions and investment returns, making the pension amount variable.

7th Pay Commission: All central govt staff except armed forces are covered under NPS

All central government employees, except those in the armed forces, who joined their services after April 2004 are covered under the New Pension System (NPS), following the scrapping of the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) as part of pension reforms implemented 20 years ago. Since then, various central and state government employee unions have been demanding the restoration of the old system. Employees who joined central government services before 2004 remain under the OPS and continue to receive a guaranteed pension.

Will Modi govt restore 50% of last-drawn salary as guaranteed pension

The Centre has previously said many times that reverting to the old pension system is not an option. But reports suggest that the Modi government is trying to find a new solution and considering a guaranteed pension amounting to 50% of the last-drawn salary for central government employees under the NPS.

According to a recent report by The Times of India, the Modi government may take this step in view of payout disparities between the Old Pension Scheme and the New Pension System.

A committee led by Finance Secretary T. V. Somanathan was tasked with examining the demand for a return to the OPS and preparing a report for the government. Under the OPS, central government employees receive a lifelong pension amounting to 50% of their last-drawn salary, with adjustments based on Pay Commission recommendations.

Why are central government employees demanding OPS restoration?

Central government employees have voiced significant concerns about the NPS, citing several issues. Employee organizations argue that the existence of two pension systems has led to income disparities among retirees from the same organization with equivalent service years, creating a sense of discrimination between different groups of employees working side by side. Additionally, the NPS is criticized for reducing take-home salaries by 10%, further fueling discontent.

To pressure the government into addressing these concerns, various groups associated with central government employees have called for the restoration of the OPS. Recently, the All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF) has formally requested the government to reinstate the OPS.

financialexpress.com,Top 10 expectations of individual taxpayers which Budget 2024 needs to fulfill,"Severely impacted by soaring inflation, declining real wages, and the escalating cost of living, individual taxpayers are eagerly looking to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as the Budget 2024 is scheduled to be presented on Tuesday (July 23rd).

This being a full-fledged budget, unlike the last one, they anticipate the FM to address their concerns. Key expectations include rationalizing income tax slab rates, raising the Section 80C deduction limit, increasing the standard deduction limit, providing more tax benefits for homebuyers and investors, and making adjustments to the New Tax Regime to enhance its appeal.

Sanjiv Malhotra, Senior Advisor, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, says, “Despite the consistent demand for a decrease in personal income tax prior to each budget, I am of the opinion that the current moment is suitable to implement this change. The middle class has been significantly impacted by years of inflation, making it reasonable for them to anticipate some form of relief. The Indian economy appears to be stable, with a GDP growth rate of 7-8%. To further stimulate growth, it is essential to shift towards a consumption-driven strategy. This shift would involve restructuring tax brackets to provide individuals with greater disposable income.”

Also Read: Best Fixed Deposit interest rates for Senior Citizens ahead of Budget 2024

Adhil Shetty, CEO of Bankbazaar.com, has similar views. “Taxpayers eagerly await budget announcements that will increase their disposable income. This year is no different; taxpayers expect higher deductions under the old regime and hope the new regime will allow more people to retain a greater portion of their income after taxes,” he says.

Given below are a few of the main anticipations that individual taxpayers have for Budget 2024:

1. De-cluttering of Section 80C

The Income Tax Act’s Section 80C has not been reviewed since 2014, and it is now necessary to make adjustments to this important aspect of tax savings. Section 80C covers various financial obligations such as housing loan principal repayments, tax-saver fixed deposits, employees’ provident fund, children’s school fees, and life insurance premiums. To maximize benefits for taxpayers, it would be beneficial to strategically streamline Section 80C. By separating loan repayments and insurance premiums, the government can offer more focused and efficient tax incentives for investments.

2. Increase in 80C deduction limit

The revision of the Section 80C deduction limit has been a long-standing desire of individual taxpayers, in addition to the de-cluttering of Section 80C of the I-T Act. The last revision was made in 2014, increasing the limit to Rs 1.5 lakh.

According to Bankbazaar, the current 80C limit of Rs 1.5 lakh, unchanged since 2014, should be increased to at least Rs 2 lakh to account for inflation and rising expenses. This enhancement will encourage taxpayers to save more and invest in financial instruments.

3. Change in Income Tax Slabs

It is always speculative to opine on the revised income tax slabs, but tax experts feel that the basic exemption limit may increase by Rs 100,000 and similarly the successive slabs may also see Rs 100,000 – Rs 200,000 increase. These numbers may look modest but given the fiscal deficit target, the FM may have a limited bandwidth.

4. More Relief under New Tax Regime

The two parallel tax regimes are likely to stay for a while, however, the government may offer some more relief under the new regime to motivate taxpayers to move towards it.

Shetty says, “Given that most taxpayers favor the old regime despite the absence of inflation adjustment, the new tax regime will need to offer higher tax exemptions. This will enhance the appeal of the new regime.”

“Income tax relief in the hands of taxpayers may partially get offset by increased GST collections (due to increased expenditure by households). Hence its net impact may not be of a significant concern to the exchequer,” suggests Malhotra.

5. Increase in Standard Deduction

Salaried individuals no longer receive travel allowance exemption and medical reimbursement starting from the Financial Year 2018-19, as they are now eligible for standard deduction. In order to address the increasing medical and fuel expenses, it is necessary to raise the standard deduction limit from the current Rs 50,000 to Rs 100,000 per annum. This adjustment will also bring parity with those earning income from business or profession, who have the option to claim actual expenses or choose a presumptive basis of taxation based on a certain percentage of their gross income.

6. Tax Sops for Homebuyers

Homebuyers who purchase their homes through a housing loan can avail tax benefits. Section 24 of the Income Tax Act allows for a deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh on the annual interest paid on the home loan EMI, while Section 80C of the I-T Act permits a deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh for the principal amount paid. Tax experts suggest that the deduction under Section 24 should be increased to at least Rs 5 lakh, given the significant rise in home loan interest rates and housing prices. Additionally, they propose enhancing the limit for housing loan principal repayments under Section 80C or introducing a separate deduction specifically tailored for home loans.

7. Increase in 80D deduction for health insurance premium

Salaried taxpayers seek an increase in the health insurance premium deduction under section 80D from Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000 at least. This change will offer significant relief and encourage prioritizing health insurance. Similarly, the 80D deduction for health insurance premium needs to be increased to Rs 100,000 for senior citizens. This change is crucial due to the significant rise in insurance premiums post-COVID-19, ensuring that health care remains affordable for all.

8. Rationalisation of capital gains tax regime

The capital gains tax structure in India is complex, with different rates for different types of assets and varying periods of holding to qualify as long term. For example, listed equity shares require a 12-month holding period, real estate requires 24 months, and debt instruments require 36 months. While there may have been historical reasons for this complexity, it may be beneficial to consider a more uniform capital gains tax structure in line with the government’s objective of simplifying the tax system, according to KPMG in India.

9. Change in HRA tax exemption rules

The House Rent Allowance (HRA) remains a valuable exemption for individual taxpayers residing in rented accommodations, particularly in cities other than their home city. According to the exemption formula, only four cities – Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata – are eligible for a 50% salary basis exemption, while the rest of the places receive a 40% salary basis exemption. However, cities such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Gurugram and Pune have also become increasingly expensive. Therefore, there is an expectation that the HRA rules may be revised in the Union Budget 2024 to include these cities for a 50% salary basis exemption.

10. Increase in exemption limit for interest on bank deposits

Under Section 80TTA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, individuals can avail a deduction of up to Rs 10,000 on the interest earned from savings in a bank, co-operative society, or post office. However, the current Rs 10,000 exemption limit for interest on bank deposits is insufficient and should be increased to Rs 50,000 at least to better reflect the current economic environment.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/top-10-expectations-of-individual-taxpayers-which-budget-2024-needs-to-fulfill-3560566/
financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Will Modi govt expand tax benefits under Section 80EEA to give a boost to affordable housing?,"Union Budget 2024: Real estate sector stakeholders, including homebuyers in the affordable housing segment, are hoping for some major reform measures in this first budget of the Modi 3.0 regime to be presented on July 23. The affordable housing segment has been tremendously benefitted by the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana during the Modi 2.0 term. Now, there is growing expectation that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will not only reintroduce but also expand tax benefits under Section 80EEA.

How much tax deduction benefit is available under Section 80EEA?

Section 80EEA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which came into effect on April 1, 2020, provides a deduction for interest on loans taken for specific house properties. The maximum deduction under Section 80EEA is Rs 1,50,000 per financial year.

This deduction is calculated based on the interest paid on the home loan, with a maximum limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh per financial year, subject to specific conditions. It is important to note that this deduction is in addition to the deductions available under Section 24B for home loan interest payments.

Under the “Housing for All” initiative, the government extended the interest deduction for low-cost housing loans taken between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2022. This led to the introduction of Section 80EEA, effective from Assessment Year 2020-21 (Financial Year 2019-20), which provides a higher interest deduction compared to its predecessor. Previously, Section 80EE allowed a deduction of up to Rs 50,000 for first-time home-buyers on loans sanctioned between April 1, 2016, and March 31, 2017. The new provision under Section 80EEA aims to offer greater financial relief and support for affordable housing.

Ahead of the budget, the real estate sector is hopeful for reform measures that will stimulate both demand and supply.

Tax benefits on home loans for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25)

Tax benefits are one of the important considerations when planning to take a housing loan. Tax benefits on housing loans are provided under Section 24, Section 80C, and Section 80EE of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Here are tax benefits under various Sections of Income Tax Act, 1961.

Under Section 24 – Rs 2 lakh per annum

Under Section 80C – Rs 1.5 lakh per annum

Under Section 80EE – Rs 50,000

“As the Union Budget 2024 approaches, home buyers across India are eagerly anticipating meaningful reforms to make property ownership more accessible and affordable. The real estate sector has demonstrated resilience and significant growth potential, especially in the affordable housing segment, driven by initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. We expect the government to reintroduce and expand tax benefits under Section 80EEA, potentially extending the loan sanctioning qualification period to March 31, 2026,” says Ashwin Sheth, Chairman and Managing Director of Ashwin Sheth Group.

“This extension would enable more individuals to benefit from the affordable housing scheme, promoting property ownership and providing substantial tax advantages. The real estate industry is on the cusp of growth and with the right policy support, we can create a more dynamic and inclusive housing market. As we await the budget presentation on July 23, we remain hopeful for measures that will boost both demand and supply while fostering sustainable and positive development in the sector,” he added.

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: FMCG sector bets on steps to boost rural consumption, grants and more","In the run-up to the Union Budget, the FMCG industry is anticipating announcements and incentives that would boost the rural economy and drive consumption in these areas. India’s FMCG and consumer industry’s growth, for several quarters, remained elusive on rising input costs impacting margins, and inflation that has resulted in low consumer spending from the rural and middle class consumers. Even as the last week of June showed sales volume growth for FMCG firms, there are concerns if this recovery is sustainable or just a blip. With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman all set to table the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, FMCG industry voiced its demands and are hopeful that the government will provide income tax relief to the salaried class in order to boost consumption, address the current inverted tax structure within the GST framework, allocate grants to the FMCG industry, among other reform policies that would boost the growth of the sector.

Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO, Marico Limited, said, “Ahead of this year’s Union Budget, we anticipate policies aimed at fostering inclusive and sustainable development. Key expectations include a continued emphasis on rural development through investments in infrastructure and employment, bolstering agricultural activities to enhance rural income. Tax relief for middle-class and salaried classes will not only enhance purchasing power but will also serve as a catalyst in increasing consumption patterns. The government’s support during the critical monsoon period is crucial for stabilizing rural economies and ensuring farmers have access to essential resources.”

Also Read Public procurement rules revised to boost local manufacturing

Per data by NielsenIQ, rural consumption declined for at least six quarters since 2021, with only a slight positive turn in the first quarter of 2023. Namit Puri, Managing Director & Senior Partner, BCG, “The Union Budget 2024 is anticipated to introduce significant changes in taxation structure. Taxation changes aimed to simulate consumption are likely to also give a boost to volume growth which has been below potential. Continued investments in physical and digital infrastructure would help in bringing greater efficiency and expansion of the consumption opportunities. A push towards unlocking rural consumption, physical infrastructure and addressing farmer earnings, would really benefit the consumer sector.”

Mayank Shah, Vice President, Parle Products, said, “We are expecting the Budget to focus on rural infrastructure and agriculture related sectors, which would help in revival of the rural economy. We saw that rural consumption was impacted last year; though it is getting revived, this will help further accelerate the revival of rural demand. That will also generate employment in rural India. Also, higher allocation to rural initiatives like NREGA will also go a long way in helping the revival of rural demand. On the urban front, initiatives for job creation will be helpful which would help drive consumption of consumer products. Government needs to take steps that could help put more money in the hands of the consumers. This can be done by lowering the tax rate or increasing the income tax slabs which would result in adding more money in the hands of rural consumers.”

Besides rural consumption, the FMCG sector also advocated for measures centered on addressing immediate economic challenges while fostering long-term growth. Manish Aggarwal, Director, Bikano, Bikanervala Foods Pvt Ltd, said, “We anticipate proactive measures to control inflation, stimulate overall consumption, create rural jobs, and incentivize capital expenditure, innovation, research, and development. Recognizing the critical role of rural economies, we emphasize the need for schemes to boost rural consumption, aiming for a more stable market in 2024.”

He also said that the government needs to introduce policies to protect oilseed farmers and the oleochemical industry. Additionally, the government should also emphasise on capital expenditure and private-sector manufacturing and services to support income generation and economic activity.

Furthermore, the industry also talked about the need for more grants to support the FMCG sector. Shammi Agarwal, Director, Pansari Group, said, “We expect the government to allocate more grants to support the FMCG industry. This financial support can boost innovation, support the start-up ecosystem, and promote research and development (R&D) within the FMCG sector.” In the 2024 Interim budget, the government’s emphasis on achieving Atmanirbharta for oilseeds, including sesame, sunflower, and mustard showed their commitment to pushing the agriculture sector towards growth. This, he added, ensured food security and also opened avenues for sustainable farming practices that benefited both farmers and consumers. “Apart from this, we hope that the government will review and rationalise export and import duties on food items. Reducing these duties can enhance the competitiveness of Indian products in global markets and ensure affordability for consumers domestically,” he said.

The FMCG sector is also looking forward to initiatives encouraging private sector investments in infrastructure, which will not only create jobs but also boost productivity. Per industry leaders, digital adoption and entrepreneurship are poised to drive job creation and economic growth, supported by policies that promote innovation and efficiency. “We are optimistic that Budget 2024-25 will set the stage for a resilient economic recovery, empowering businesses, and will contribute to India’s growth trajectory,” said Saugata Gupta.

Here is more on what the industry leaders and experts are saying and expecting from the Union Budget:

Sunil Agarwal, Co-founder and Chairman, Joy Personal Care (RSH Global)

Key expectations include a reduction in income tax slabs to boost consumer purchasing power, improved access to credit for businesses, and significant GST reforms to lower costs on branded food products. The FMCG sector’s remarkable adaptability to changing consumer behavior has been evident for years. While the upcoming budget is expected to prioritize education, employment, and healthcare, it is essential for other industries to receive a boost as well. Maintaining fiscal responsibility is crucial in this uncertain global environment, but addressing high GST rates on essential FMCG products and enhancing infrastructure development will be vital for long-term growth. Looking ahead, increased government spending and consumer-centric policies like tax reduction offer a promising path for market revival.

Anubhav Agarwal, MD and CEO, BN Group

With a growing economy, strong investor sentiment and consistent increase in consumer spending, the FMCG industry is poised to grow significantly. We expect new regulations that successfully address issues faced by rural communities while protecting the interests of oilseed producers and the oleochemical sector. Furthermore, we anticipate the government will address the gap between MSP of crops and prices for final processed, as it will further boost the growth and development of the sector.

Akash Agrawal, Co-Founder, Zoff Foods

We urge the government to address the current inverted tax structure within the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework. This structure impacts food manufacturers, hindering their ability to claim the full Input Tax Credit (ITC) due to higher tax rate paid for services and other items as compared to lower tax rate of raw materials. The tax rate on basic raw material procurement and final product is 5 per cent, which makes a significant ITC blockage for manufacturers, leading to an average cash flow deficit of 10-15 per cent. This ultimately translates to reduced investments in production capacity, innovation, and job creation.

Nikhil Sethi, Partner and National Head, Consumer Goods, KPMG in India

The FMCG sector has been constrained for some time now due to low consumption growth and many external factors including elections, increasing commodity prices and tougher regulations. A budget that can help the sector should include initiatives that:

Provide stimulus to the currently constrained consumption: Accomplishable by increasing tax benefits, allowances and exemptions for individuals and allocating a higher budget for the NREGA scheme.

Incentivize manufacturing investments for new capacities and innovation: Extending the PLI scheme to include FMCG and consumer goods sectors, aiming to increase domestic production. Offering substantial financial incentives to organizations that invest in innovation, research, technology development, local sourcing, and sustainable practices that contribute to the betterment of the environment and society will not only boost manufacturing but also enhance global competitiveness, employment creation and consumer trust.

Phase regulatory compliances to synchronize investments required with sales, for instance, that on packaging or formulations.

Incentivize the ability to export to meet global standards, manufacture value added products, build scale, and so on. Introducing comprehensive tax benefits and simplify export procedures can double FMCG exports by 2026.

Allocate budget or give subsidies for strengthening value chains across agricultural and dairy sectors by adopting technology/artificial intelligence, automation in food processing infrastructure, waste reduction and crop insurance.

Atul Garg, Managing Director, GRM Overseas Limited

We hope that the budget will include measures to create buffer stocks of essential food grains like rice and wheat to address any shortfall in production and also to avoid export restrictions.

Strengthening access to credit for long-term loans is essential to enhance growth, productivity, and farm income in the agri- commodity sector. Additionally, minimizing wastage by augmenting storage capacities and upgrading warehouses is crucial. Infrastructure still continues to be a challenge and its pan-India development is a critical driver of agricultural growth. Building rural infrastructure, including roads, bridges, storage facilities, cold chains, and veterinary services, can significantly reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access for farmers in remote areas. These measures will lead to increased participation of India in global agriculture and food exports.

We recommend enhancing the budget allocation for the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) to boost farm exports. Establishing district export hubs are essential steps toward achieving these goals.

Siddhartha Nangia, Co-Founder, Smytten

As we anticipate the Union Budget 2024, the FMCG sector is looking for policies that will stimulate both rural and urban demand. Initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency, reduce operational costs, and support digital transformation will be pivotal. We also hope for incentives to promote sustainable packaging and eco-friendly practices, aligning with the global shift towards sustainability. Enhanced investment in infrastructure, particularly in logistics and transportation, will be critical for improving market access and reducing costs. Furthermore, supportive policies for startups and MSMEs can boost entrepreneurial initiatives within the sector.

Priyanka Duggal, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat

The consumer industry is hopeful for rationalisation of the provisions of accelerated tax incentives for employment generation, simplified tax structures as well as adding incentives for the startups looking at reverse flip to Indian holding companies, retail-centric initiatives for digitisation simplifying the equalisation levy, TDS and TCS provisions. From a direct tax perspective, the interim Budget 2024 seems to have missed extending the concessional tax rate of 15 per cent for new manufacturing companies. Reflecting at the importance and impending growth of the sector, a clear ask from the Budget will be to reinstate the same. With technology and AI becoming critical for retail and ecommerce companies, the need of the hour is promoting digitisation for businesses and introducing accelerated tax breaks on digitisation expenditures.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-fmcg-sector-bets-on-steps-to-boost-rural-consumption-grants-and-more-3559923/

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Anticipating transformative measures for MSMEs,"By Tarun Singh

As the Union Budget 2024 approaches, anticipation is palpable across the nation. The annual budget is not merely a financial document but a blueprint of India’s aspirations and priorities. Over the past almost eight decades, India’s journey has been marked by steadfast devotion to democracy, integrity, and sustainable growth. Despite encountering challenges, the country has continually evolved, embodying resilience and unwavering pursuit of progress. This narrative is both commendable and a source of national pride.

The forthcoming budget is expected to be no different in its significance. It will, by default, reflect the myriad factors that have shaped India’s impressive economic narrative. This narrative is built upon the nation’s collective sensibilities, transcending political, historical, and geopolitical challenges.

In a democracy like India, the collective strength of individuals fosters a belief system that prioritizes the sense of nation’s building. This collective dynamism is evident in the country’s thriving economy as well, significantly bolstered by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). These enterprises, collectively, make the backbone of the Indian economy, driving future growth and innovation.

Given their crucial role, it is imperative that the upcoming budget prioritises MSMEs. Adequate support and favorable policies for MSMEs are essential for India to aim to sustain a CAGR of 8-9% and achieve its ambitious goal of becoming a $10 trillion economy.

Ensuring that MSMEs receive the attention and resources they deserve is critical for India’s sustained progress. As we await the Union Budget 2024, it is essential to recognize that India’s economic success is built on the collaborative efforts of countless individuals and enterprises. Their collective strength has forged a resilient and dynamic economy that is rightly a source of national pride.

Furthermore, the Union Budget should continue to serve as a strategic vision statement that unites all stakeholders—Government, Corporations, MSMEs, and Citizens—in the collective endeavour of nation-building. Each stakeholder, through focused efforts, contributes to lighting the path forward. This unifying vision can catalyse innovative solutions and collaborations, fostering unprecedented growth.

In essence, the upcoming Union Budget is not just a fiscal statement; it is a reflection of a nation’s collective strength, aspirations, and achievements. As India stands on the brink of becoming a global economic powerhouse, it is timely to acknowledge the journey thus far and look forward to the promising future that lies ahead.

Undoubtedly, the Union Budget holds unparalleled significance in actualizing India’s ambition of becoming a preeminent global power. Its role is not just to allocate funds, but to strategically address and rectify the nation’s enduring economic and civic challenges. In an era of transformation, the budget must act as a catalyst for growth, rather than an impediment to the nation’s progress.

A well-articulated vision within the budget can unify diverse stakeholders in unprecedented ways, sparking innovative solutions and collaborative efforts. Thus, the Union Budget must serve as an annual manifesto, reaffirming a shared vision that mobilizes corporations, MSMEs, the government, and citizens alike. Each stakeholder, by actively participating, contributes to illuminating the collective path forward, steering India towards a prosperous and sustainable future.

financialexpress.com,What India’s leading developers expect from Budget 2024,"India’s economy has displayed impressive resilience and sustained strong macroeconomic health despite global economic challenges. As India prepares for the Union Budget 2024, the real estate sector, which has experienced robust growth and demand recovery post-pandemic, is anticipated to receive a boost to further drive its expansion.

The government’s steadfast dedication to the ‘Housing for All’ initiative underscores the necessity for substantial fiscal backing to accomplish its goals. “With indications of controlled inflation, promising growth prospects, and the anticipation of a favorable monsoon, there is ample room for growth. The eagerly-anticipated Union Budget, which outlines the government’s financial strategy, is eagerly awaited by both the industry and individuals. The real estate sector is hopeful for specific announcements that could benefit homebuyers and the industry,” says Dr. Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head – Research and REIS, India, JLL.

Here we take a look at India’s leading property developers’ key expectations from the Budget 2024:

Kalyan Chakrabarti, CEO, Emaar India: “As we await the upcoming union budget, we are optimistic that it shall be akin to the interim budget auguring growth and development. We continue to seek an industry status for the real estate sector, which would represent a significant stride on the infrastructure front by the government. This move would enable developers to lower borrowing costs and pass on the benefits to the customers. As key stakeholders in the sector, one of our primary expectations is a reduction on GST rates on construction materials to enhance affordability and make home-buying more accessible. We expect policies that will promote financial inclusivity and incentivisation, such as reforms in taxation and financial accessibility. Additionally, optimising the process of land acquisition and registration of properties to make it more transparent and efficient, further encouraging development and investment in the sector. We are hopeful that the budget will positively contribute to the real estate sector’s mission of inclusive growth, sustainable development, and job creation in the coming years.”

Naveen Gadde, MD, Navanaami: “The real estate sector faces significant challenges due to the rising costs of land and construction materials. These escalating expenses have made it difficult for developers to maintain the feasibility of launching new projects, which has contributed to shooting the cost of property for the middle class. We hope that the home loan rate of interests will be reduced to push demand and make good properties available for the real estate sector. The government can also grant stamp duty concessions. We hope the budget will introduce fiscal incentives and policy reforms that will help stimulate demand and ease liquidity constraints. Such measures are crucial for enabling developers to continue providing affordable housing options to a broader segment of the population. By addressing these challenges, the government can ensure the growth of the real estate sector and make homeownership more accessible to many aspiring homeowners. Additionally, we expect initiatives that promote sustainable development and enhance the overall ease of doing business in this sector.”

Rishi Raj, COO, Max Estates: “While the implementation of RERA has brought much-needed transparency and accountability to the real estate sector, developers believe that granting industry status to real estate could further catalyze growth and investment. There is a pressing need to simplify procedures and foster innovation within the sector. We are hopeful that the upcoming budget will address these needs by introducing policies that promote sustainable practices and encourage the use of advanced technologies in construction and project management. Such initiatives will not only enhance efficiency but also ensure the long-term growth and modernization of the real estate industry. Additionally, with respect to GST, allowing for Input Tax Credit for built to lease commercial real estate projects is not only consistent with core principles of GST but also will further aid development of Grade A+ commercial developments critical to further strengthen India’s position as hub for global services (e.g., Global Capability Centres). By addressing these critical issues, the government can create a more supportive environment for real estate development, benefiting both developers and homebuyers in the Delhi NCR region and beyond.”

Anuj Munot, CEO & Founder, UrbanWrk: “The Indian real estate sector has shown strong performance in recent quarters, making the 2024 Union Budget a crucial moment for the industry. Anticipated reforms are expected to streamline processes, boost transparency, and drive growth. With NITI Aayog projecting the sector’s market size to hit $1 trillion by 2030, it is imperative for the government to address key issues such as high input costs for materials like steel and cement. Lowering the 28% GST on cement and granting real estate industry status can reduce construction expenses and facilitate developers in accessing loans at lower interest rates. Moreover, the implementation of a single-window clearance system will expedite project approvals, creating a more efficient and investor-friendly environment. These initiatives will not only stimulate growth but also significantly contribute to the country’s GDP, increasing the sector’s share from 8% to 13% by 2025.”

Ashok Singh Jaunapuria, MD and CEO of SS Group: “We are eagerly awaiting the Union Budget 2024, hoping for tax reforms, increased incentives for affordable housing, greater investment in urban infrastructure, and more efficient regulatory procedures. These measures will boost the growth of the real estate sector, making homeownership more accessible and sustainable. It is recommended that the government raise the interest deduction limit to promote homeownership. By improving tax benefits, potential homebuyers will be more motivated to invest in real estate, enhancing their financial security and stimulating market expansion. Higher deductions on home loan interest could make owning a home more financially feasible for many, potentially leading to a surge in demand for residential properties. Furthermore, increased investment in urban infrastructure can enhance connectivity and quality of life, making urban areas more appealing to residents and investors. Streamlined regulatory processes will assist developers in completing projects more efficiently, reducing costs and delays.”

Manas Mehrotra, Founder, 315Work Avenue: “The country is seeing a new office culture given the change in work patterns across the world and new preferences of the workforce. Understandably, the coworking industry has become more relevant than ever with the demand surging significantly in the recent times owing to its affordable pricing options and flexible work culture. Large enterprises too have shifted gears to coworking space as they embraced the hybrid work model to suit their organizational requirements. India continues to be the fastest growing flex office market in the APAC region and is set to account for one-fifth of the office market by 2030. Taking into consideration the popularity of hybrid working, we have a few expectations around GST and taxation from the upcoming Union Budget that can further accelerate growth of this sector.

In recent years, the entrepreneurial landscape has undergone a significant change and coworking spaces have emerged as a transformative force in India’s startup ecosystem. Some of the measures that we could look forward to include lower GST rate for small-scale coworking clients. This will significantly help the coworking industry boost their footprints by attracting small start-ups to be part of the industry as well as increase the revenue collection to the government. The salary upper limit of 25k could be enhanced to 40k and timeline from 3 yrs to 5 yrs to enable start-ups/coworking entities to enjoy the benefit of sec 80JJAA as these industries are generating a greater volume of employment. Input tax credit under GST is an important issue that concerns coworking sector. We expect the budget would enable coworking firms to claim input credit on work contract and construction services supplied so that it is passed on to companies who lease out space for coworking and thereby reduce their overall costs.”

Ramani Sastri, Chairman & MD, Sterling Developers: “The real estate sector plays a pivotal role in the economy, contributing significantly to employment and GDP. Hence, the upcoming budget should introduce measures that will bolster this economic context. The Indian real estate sector continues to scale new heights in 2024 driven by positive market sentiments. economic expansion, urbanization, evolving lifestyles, rising disposable incomes, better employment opportunities, increased business activity and government policies amongst others. The desire for homeownership remains undeterred among consumers, as residential sales continue to breach previous highs. This year, the demands go beyond the usual expectation of single-window clearance and industry status, which could unlock financial advantages and streamline project approvals. There is an express need for more tax sops for both homebuyers as well as investors. The government should raise the deduction limit for interest payment on home loans from the existing Rs 2 lakh a year to Rs 5 lakh, which will add momentum to housing demand, reduce GST on under-construction properties and effect adjustments in raw material pricing. For a large section of the population, affordability remains the biggest challenge and hence there should also be expansion in the definition of affordable housing as this would expand the benefits for homebuyers and hence boost the end-user demand. Any tax exemption from rental income will also encourage greater investment in residential real estate.”

Dinesh Gupta, Secretary, CREDAI Western UP: “Boosting the real estate sector with tax incentives, improved tax structures, and a single-window clearance policy will encourage further investment in the real estate sector from both domestic and foreign sources. Furthermore, tax reforms that lower income taxes for both corporations and individuals, simplify tax legislation, offer targeted incentives, expand the SWAMIH stress fund, and lower the GST rates on building materials will boost the building industry and improve the situation for real estate players. The combined effect of the aforementioned reforms will raise the amount of money accessible to taxpayers, enabling them to buy real estate more enthusiastically and ultimately speed up the nation’s economic growth.”

Sarthi Goel, CEO of Civitech Group: “The real estate industry expects a number of significant changes to promote efficiency and growth. Real estate will attract investors and simplify rules if it is given industrial status. Simplifying the clearance process with a single window can speed up project approvals, cut down on delays, and improve project execution in general. Moreover, higher house loan interest rate deductions are essential for expanding access to luxury properties, which would boost demand and foster a healthy market environment. These programs not only help the industry reach its growth goals, but they also significantly improve the state of the economy as a whole by creating jobs and stimulating infrastructural development.”

Himanshu Garg, Director, RG Group: “To improve housing accessibility, tax slabs should be raised and limit of affordable housing should be revised. Industry experts are in favour of raising the housing affordability cap in metro areas, especially in the MMR and NCR regions, from ₹45 lakhs to ₹75 lakhs. As a basic need of person and safe investment, home loan rates should be low and the limit of the Credit-Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) can also be increased. Aside from that, simplifying GST is essential to lower expenses and improve affordability for homebuyers. Additionally, easing FDI regulations will draw in international capital, promoting growth and innovation in the luxury market.”

Bhavesh Kothari, Founder & CEO, Property First: “We are optimistic and expect the upcoming budget to bring in massive transformations. We urge the Finance Minister to implement tax reliefs in terms of reduction in GST rate along with an input tax credit on under-construction properties. Besides, anticipation is high that home mortgage rates will drop considerably to pave the way for renewed growth. Granting industry status to the sector would be another significant step that would catalyse growth and contribute to the nation’s economy. Also, we expect the government to continue focusing on more infrastructure development in highways, metro lines, planned satellite cities, etc as it will help drive housing demand across the country.”

Madhusudan G, CMD, Sumadhura Group: “We expect the Union Budget 2024-25 to introduce progressive reforms to meet the rising demand for residential and commercial spaces. Our top priorities include tax breaks for affordable housing projects to boost stagnant sales in the sector. Also, a revival of the Credit-Linked Subsidy Scheme will make homeownership more accessible. We also expect tax incentives and infrastructure enhancements to boost urban living standards and drive growth in emerging areas. Simultaneously, we expect the government to grant industry status to real estate, a long-standing demand that could drive fresh investment and growth.”

Pyush Lohia, Director, Lohia Worldspace: “We are hopeful that the upcoming budget will bring significant changes. We are particularly looking for increased investment in infrastructure and meaningful tax reforms. Easing tax provisions on housing would be a significant step, making homes more affordable and driving demand. The deduction limit on interest paid on home loans needs to be raised from the current cap of Rs 2 lakh per annum. These measures would turn out critical not just for the sector but for broader economic growth, job creation, and supporting small businesses. A balanced approach will pave the way for sustainable development.”

Anantharam Varayur, Co-founder of Manasum Senior Living Homes: “With the number of elderly people rapidly growing, the senior living industry is set for major growth. Projections show that the proportion of elderly individuals aged 60 and above is expected to reach 19.5% by 2050. Currently, India has 150 million elderly people, which is expected to reach 230 million in the next 10-12 years. However, the penetration rate of senior living properties is only 1% in India with only 18,000 units across the country, compared to 6% in the US and 11% in the UK. There is ample scope to meet the supply gap and the ever-increasing demand. There is a need to look at providing subsidies or tax deductions for low- and middle-income seniors in order to increase affordability of these housing units. Further, on the income tax front, senior citizens should be given some relief at this later stage of their life, given that they have been responsible citizens and paid taxes throughout their lives. Among other reliefs, the budget should provide relaxation on services and purchases in real estate. Additionally, infrastructure development in Tier-II and Tier-III cities is key for the sector.”",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/what-indias-leading-developers-expect-from-budget-2024-3559865/

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: How to make the New Tax Regime more attractive,"The Budget 2024 is right around the corner, and every taxpayer is waiting with bated breath to see how it will affect his wallet. The budget not only sets the economic tone for the country but also profoundly impacts individual finances. This article explores ways the government could make the new tax regime more attractive for taxpayers.

What is the new tax regime?

The Finance Act 2020 inserted Section 115BAC, with effect from the assessment year 2021-22, to provide for an alternative regime providing for lower tax rates for individuals and Hindu undivided families (HUF). However, an assessee has to forego various exemptions and deductions to claim the benefit of reduced tax rates under this regime. Last year, the Finance Act 2023 extended the scope of this regime to AOP, BOI, and AJP and made it a default tax regime.

Why are taxpayers not switching to the new tax regime?

The new tax regime was designed to simplify tax computation. It came with lower tax rates and new tax slabs but required taxpayers to give up many popular deductions and exemptions. These deductions include premiums paid towards life insurance, home loan principal/interest payments, health insurance premiums and many more.

Although the new tax regime offers lower tax rates, many people found it less beneficial due to the loss of deductions. Thus, despite its higher tax rates, the old tax regime remained popular because it ultimately resulted in a lower tax liability for small taxpayers compared to the new regime. Where an individual is eligible to claim deductions under Section 80C, Section 80D and interest on a housing loan under Section 24(b), the old tax regime is always beneficial for him. Where there is no housing loan but one pays rent, no exemption is allowed under Section 10(13A) for the HRA under the new tax regime. This makes the new tax regime unattractive for many salaried individuals who migrate to metro cities for employment.

How to make the new tax regime popular?

Introduce deductions

In India, a significant proportion of home purchases are financed through home loans. While exact numbers fluctuate yearly, estimates suggest that around 70-80% of home buyers in urban areas rely on home loans to finance their new houses. A taxpayer with a home loan can avail deductions under Sections 80C and 24(b) for principal repayment and interest payments, leading to substantial tax savings.

Further, considering the high cost of medical treatment, medical insurance is a must-buy for every taxpayer. The deduction of medical insurance premiums is available under Section 80D. Similarly, almost every salaried employee gets from tax savings through the House Rent Allowance (HRA). The new tax regime does not allow these deductions. Therefore, taxpayers cannot simply switch to the new regime without first calculating their tax liability under the old regime.

Accordingly, introducing some common deductions can significantly increase the appeal of the new tax regime. Allowing deductions for HRA, home loan repayment, and medical insurance would make the new tax regime more attractive.

Beyond incorporating existing deductions, the finance minister should introduce new deductions specific to the new tax regime. These could be tailored to modern financial needs and expenses, providing further incentives for taxpayers to transition from the old tax regime to the new tax regime.

Change in tax slab

A tax slab refers to an income range that attracts a specific tax rate. Under income tax, individual taxpayers are subject to varying tax rates based on their income levels.

The existing basic exemption limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh in the old tax regime has remained unchanged since the Budget 2015. Further, individuals are taxed at a rate of 30% on income exceeding Rs. 10 lakh. Despite hyperinflation, the government still needs to revise these thresholds. It is unlikely that the government will change the tax slabs and rates under the old tax regime because its primary goal is to encourage people to switch to the new tax regime. Therefore, modifying the old tax regime would hinder the government’s objective.

However, changes in slabs or tax rates are possible under the new tax regime. Presently, the basic exemption limit in the new tax regime stands at Rs. 3 lakh, with the highest tax rate of 30% applicable on income exceeding Rs. 15 lakh. Therefore, tax slabs or rate changes under the new tax regime may encourage greater taxpayer participation.

Here’s a list of 9 facts about India’s Budget presentation:

–First Budget of Independent India: India’s inaugural Union Budget post-independence was presented on November 26, 1947, by RK Shanmukham Chetty, marking a historic fiscal milestone.

–Most Budgets Presented: Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai holds the record for presenting the most budgets among Indian finance ministers. He served under Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri and presented a total of 10 budgets during his tenure.

Desai’s budgetary legacy began with his first budget on February 28, 1959. Over the years, he presented full budgets consecutively for the next two years. In 1962, he presented an interim budget, followed by two more full budgets. After a gap of four years, Desai presented another interim budget in 1967. Subsequently, he presented three full budgets in consecutive years from 1967 to 1969, completing a total of 10 budgets during his distinguished tenure as Finance Minister.

–Second Highest Number of Budgets: Congress leader P Chidambaram, former Finance Minister, presented budgets on nine occasions. His stints included terms -under the United Front government led by HD Deve Gowda and later during the Congress-led UPA regime.

–Third Highest Number of Budgets: Congress leader and former President Pranab Mukherjee presented eight budgets, spanning from the early 1980s to 2012, prominently during his role in the UPA government, contributing significantly to India’s economic policies.

–Manmohan Singh’s Contributions: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh presented five consecutive budgets between 1991 and 1995, during his tenure as Finance Minister under P V Narasimha Rao’s government, pivotal for India’s economic reforms.

–Longest Budget Speech: Nirmala Sitharaman delivered the longest budget speech on February 1, 2020, lasting two hours and 40 minutes, underlining comprehensive fiscal policies and reforms.

–Shortest Budget Speech: Hirubhai Mulljibhai Patel’s interim Budget speech in 1977 remains the shortest, succinctly delivered in just 800 words.

–Historical Timing Shift: Traditionally, the Budget was presented on the final day of February at 5 pm, a practice dating back to colonial times when announcements synchronized with London’s time zone. India, being 4 hours and 30 minutes ahead of British Summer Time, ensured the Budget was delivered during daylight hours in the UK. In 1999, Finance Minister Yashwant Singh of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government changed the timing to 11 am. Since then, Budget presentations have consistently occurred at this earlier hour.

–Date Change: In 2017, the Budget presentation date was moved to February 1st to expedite the Parliamentary approval process, ensuring completion by the end of March. This adjustment enabled the Budget’s implementation to commence from April 1st, the start of the fiscal year. Previously, presenting the Budget on February 29th necessitated a delay in implementation until May or June, factoring in the 2-3 months required for parliamentary approval.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-9-key-facts-to-know-ahead-of-fm-sitharamans-speech-3559900/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Banking sector hopes for policy continuity; announcements on FDI, divestment, cyber security measures and more","As we are closing in on the date of the Union Budget presentation, the banking sector is betting on policy continuity on infrastructure spend. The industry leaders and experts said that the Budget should announce policy changes and incentives that help move towards growth, bring financial stability, and support digitalisation. Yashraj Erande, India Leader, Financial Services, BCG, said, “For India to become a $7 trillion economy, the financial services and fintech sector has a crucial multiplier role to play. We expect the pace of reforms to accelerate with the upcoming budget. The focus of the reforms has to be on creating more large scale balance sheets, infusing digital and AI in the financial services operating model to drive efficiency, with exceptional focus on governance and risk. Driving better partnerships between fintechs and unlocking more pools of domestic and global capital to fund these balance sheets plus technology will be crucial.”

Prashant Kumar, MD & CEO, YES Bank, said, “The government is expected to remain committed to the reforms process and be focused on eight key areas: sustainable growth, financial sector, infrastructure and investment, women, youth & farmers, last-mile connectivity, inclusive development, and economic expansion – all essential towards achieving ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. At YES BANK, we are prepared to support the government’s push for enhancing digital infrastructure and promoting financial inclusion. This aligns with our commitment to bringing advanced banking services to underserved regions and supporting initiatives in green mobility, affordable housing, healthcare, and education. These efforts will not only spur economic growth but also ensure holistic development.”

The industry experts also recommended that the government should increase foreign direct investment (FDI) to boost capital in the sector. Vivek Iyer, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat, said, “Given that India is a banking led economy, initiatives around liberalisation of foreign direct investment, rationalisation of foreign bank tax rates amongst others will help boost capital flows in the country, which will further accelerate the goals towards Amrit Kaal that the government set out for India.” Currently, 49 per cent of FDI in the banking sector is allowed under the automatic route and beyond that, government approval is required for private banks. In public sector banks, up to 20 per cent of FDI is allowed.

Many also talked about taking actions towards divestment in banks and insurance. Per experts, privatisation of certain institutions could help bring in more investment and thereby strengthen the financial system. Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, said, “There is a wish for a reduction in government presence, particularly in the banking and insurance sectors. While divestment has been discussed over the years, there has been limited progress towards achieving this. Now is the right time for the government to consider divestment in banks and insurance to help supercharge the credit growth required for an above 8 per cent growth rate.”

Further, with the rise in the number of frauds in the banking sector, the industry also expects the government to announce common policies and measures that will augment enterprise resilience and cyber security. According to the RBI annual report released on May 30, as many as 36,075 frauds were reported in banks in FY24, growing by nearly 166 per cent as against the 13,564 cases reported during FY23. Mahesh Ramamoorthy, Chief Information Officer, YES Bank, said, “Establishing a continuum of cybersecurity measures is essential to improving an organisation’s security posture. Investments in advanced threat intelligence and robust encryption will protect our digital assets and build user trust. Additionally, improving data privacy and governance will ensure compliance with global standards and safeguard user information.”

Further, V Balasubramanian, CEO, Financial Software and Systems, said that the government should also look at charging digital payments like UPI. He said, “The government should look at charging digital payments like UPI which will allow banks to build robust payment infrastructure and security standards enabling fast, simple and secure payments while protecting the end consumers against frauds and cyber security threats. Apart from this, the government should also focus on building a payment platform on cloud for banks. This is where cloud technology can play a major role in empowering banks to be more agile, cost-effective and collaborative in their endeavours to make digital payments safe and secure.”

Here is what’s more on the wishlist of the banking sector for the Union Budget, to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23…

Anish Mashruwala, Partner, JSA Advocates and Solicitors

Given the continuity of the NDA government coming out of the recent elections, the safest bet for the banking sector is the continuity of the policy on infrastructure spend. Any additional spend there has a direct fillip to lending in the banking sector, with cascading effects in the industry supply chain verticals. Accordingly, the banking sector will hope that the growth decade of India continues with heavy infra spend. One other area that I believe the banking sector will look to is some guidance and guardrail policies around prolific digitisation. With the challenge of rising frauds in the industry and the onset of generative artificial intelligence, the banking sector, while already gearing up for that, would be looking for common policies establishing acceptable standards. Towards that, if the government could assist in sops on the spends to establish robust departments within the banks, it will incentivise the sector to embrace the challenges quicker.

Divyesh Dalal, Managing Director & Head – Global Transaction Services, SME & Institutional Liability Business, DBS Bank India

The upcoming Union Budget presents an opportunity to boost the growth of India’s MSME sector. Measures like Production-Linked Incentives, Export promotion, Digital India campaign, simplification of tax structure and Skill development will bolster the global competitiveness of MSMEs. We are optimistic about the continued thrust on digital adoption, financial inclusion, green policies, market access and concerted efforts to foster entrepreneurship. These will help integrate MSMEs deeper into global value chains while incubating new ideas and sparking innovation. We hope to see measures that will augment enterprise resilience and cyber security, considering emerging external risks.

Rajesh Narain Gupta, Founder & Chairman, SNG & Partners

Banking requires dynamic and timely reforms for countries like India. FDI in banking should be increased to invite more capital; government participation in public sector banks should be reduced asap; incentives to individuals on tax applied on fixed deposits should be given to increase liability business and to create level playing field with the stock market and create balance; big incentives should be given to private sector especially SME on Capital Expenses for capacity building and increase employment and also to reduce dependency on government spending; focused reform and incentives be given on long term lending by banks on identified infrastructure projects; tax concessions should be given to private sector availing Green Finance to set up greenfield and brownfield Green Projects.

Protections should be given to decision makers in the banking sector where loans go bad or lead to fraud where decision is taken in the normal course and committee-based approach. Fear of penalty and prosecution need to be balanced for the banking industry to apply themselves.

Rajeev Yadav, Deputy CEO, AU Small Finance Bank

The newly appointed government will be expected to continue with policy focus on prudent fiscal management and fiscal glide path to achieve a fiscal deficit of 4.5 per cent by FY 26. This augurs well for overall macro-stability for transitioning towards the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047. I believe the Union Government budget should focus on five key priorities for the upcoming Union Budget

– Commitment towards fiscal discipline needs to get reiterated and will boost India’s fiscal image at a time of global bond inclusion.

– Viksit Bharat requires scaling up of financial intermediation in a sustainable manner. There is an urgent need to accelerate deposit mobilization by the banking system. The FY25 Union Budget (along with support from the RBI) could look at providing a level playing field to bank deposits vis-à-vis other competing instruments by incentivizing deposit mobilization through lowering tax incidence on FDs.

– With the government’s focus on digitization and financialization of the economy and boosting cyber security, the Indian banking system needs to meaningfully scale up the technological infrastructure to be future ready. FY25 Union Budget could offer some tax rebates for scaling up technological infrastructure.

– The Union Budget needs to be multi-dimensional prioritising filling of government jobs, existing PLI Scheme to reinvigorate labour intensive sectors like textiles, leather, tourism, etc, doubling increasing allocation towards education from close to 3 per cent currently of GDP to around 6 per cent.

– The Budget could consider increasing targeted allocation for affordable housing under the PMAY Scheme while also providing tax incentives to home loan borrowers for developers. Scaling up of agriculture infrastructure and encouraging ‘farm tourism’ will also provide a strong impetus to rural incomes.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-banking-sector-hopes-for-policy-continuity-announcements-on-fdi-divestment-cyber-security-measures-and-more-3560060/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: Consumer durable industry calls for 5-12% GST cut,"The consumer durables sector outlines important expectations for policy considerations as the budget draws near. The industry is pushing for a 5 or 12 per cent GST cut on both entry-level and luxury appliances in order to increase affordability and spur growth for all income brackets. In order to strengthen local manufacturing and create jobs, tax reductions for raw materials, components, and machinery improvements are emphasised, along with the necessity of continued support for the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) plan and the Made in India initiative.



In fact, the Union Budget of 2024 plays a crucial role in keeping India as the world’s third-largest economy. With India contributing $3.7 trillion to the global economy and having the largest population of young people, there is a lot of untapped potential.

Let’s have a look at what the industry specialist foresee:

As per Kamal Nandi, Business Head and Executive Vice President of Godrej Appliances, the durables industry will gain from measures that reduce input costs, encourage technological innovation towards building energy-efficient products and lower taxation to induce appliance adoption and penetration in the country. “With temperatures rising above 50°C in many cities, ACs are certainly becoming a necessity. GST reduction will make ACs more affordable to masses and improve the quality of life for many more Indians. We also need to recognise the environmental impact of appliances and recommend addressing it with lower tax rates for consumers to switch to 5-star rated products,” Nandi added.

“Encouraging the use of automation is seen as pivotal for reducing costs and improving competitiveness in the business environment. Addressing human capital needs, there is an emphasis on skill development initiatives and industry-academia partnerships to upskill the workforce. Additionally, the industry advocates for regulatory streamlining to lower transaction costs and enhance the ease of doing business. Lastly, there is a plea for tax incentives promoting sustainable practices, aligning with global environmental goals and making sustainability a competitive advantage,” Mahesh Gupta, Chairman of Kent RO Systems stated.

For Avneet Singh Marwah, CEO, Super Plastronics Pvt Ltd, Exclusive Brand Licensee of Blaupunkt TVs in India, there is a need to focus on strategies that encourage spending and investment in order to boost the economy and tackle the rising inflation. “Keeping the 15% corporate tax rate for new manufacturing ventures would attract both local and international businesses to set up shop in India. One expected move is reducing the GST rate on LED TVs larger than 32 inches from 28% to 18%. Another proposal is to review income tax slabs to increase disposable income for taxpayers as it would likely lead to higher spending and boost consumption across various sectors,” Marwah explained.

“As we look ahead to the upcoming Union Budget 2024, we are highly optimistic about its transformative potential for the consumer durables sector. We eagerly expect the new government to bring in policies that support research and development, enhance infrastructure, and promote sustainable practices,” Harshit Aggarwal, CEO and Founder Novamax Appliances said.

Interestingly, Arjun Bajaj, Director of Videotex believes that the Indian government should prioritise comprehensive support for the local manufacturing of electronics, including the television industry. “While mobile phone manufacturing has benefited from numerous incentives, the TV manufacturing sector, despite contributing nearly USD 12 billion to the economy, has faced neglect. Furthermore, the industry is heavily reliant on imports for critical components like semiconductors and display fabs, predominantly sourced from China and Taiwan. This dependence exposes the industry to price volatility and supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical tensions. While the government has initiated efforts to establish semiconductor manufacturing in India, it is crucial to expedite these projects and also focus on developing domestic display manufacturing capabilities. This would reduce dependency on imports, stabilise the supply chain, and strengthen the overall electronics manufacturing ecosystem in India,” Bajaj shared.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-consumer-durable-industry-calls-for-5-12-gst-cut-3560049/
financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: What is the difference between Economic Survey and Budget? Explained,"The Economic Survey and the Budget are two critical documents in India’s fiscal policy landscape, each serving distinct yet complementary roles in shaping the country’s economic strategy and priorities.

Understanding Economic Survey

Imagine the economic survey as a detailed report card on the country’s financial performance over the past year. Prepared by the Chief Economic Advisor, it dives deep into key economic indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, inflation rates, and the performance of various sectors like agriculture, industry, and services. The survey also analyzes the government’s fiscal deficit, which tells us the gap between its income and spending. Here are key aspects of the Economic Survey:

-Analysis of Economic Performance: It offers a comprehensive review of the economic performance, covering aspects like GDP growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, external sector developments, employment trends, and sectoral performance.

-Policy Recommendations: The Survey provides policy recommendations based on economic analysis. These recommendations often include reforms needed to address current economic challenges and enhance long-term growth prospects.

-Data-driven Insights: It includes detailed data, charts, and graphs to illustrate economic trends and projections, making it a valuable resource for policymakers, economists, and analysts.

-Medium to Long-term Outlook: While it provides insights into the current economic situation, its focus extends to medium to long-term economic outlook and potential challenges.

-Global and Domestic Context: It contextualizes India’s economic performance within the global economic environment and discusses implications of global trends on domestic policies.

Union Budget:

The Union Budget, presented annually by the Finance Minister, outlines the government’s revenue and expenditure plans for the upcoming fiscal year. Here are its primary features:

-Revenue and Expenditure Allocation: It details the government’s projected revenue from various sources (taxes, borrowings, etc.) and allocates funds across sectors and schemes.

-Policy Initiatives: The Budget introduces new policy measures, tax proposals, and reforms aimed at achieving economic growth, promoting social welfare, and addressing fiscal challenges.

-Sectoral Allocations: It specifies budgetary allocations for key sectors like agriculture, education, healthcare, infrastructure, defense, etc., reflecting government priorities.

-Fiscal Deficit and Debt Management: It includes projections of fiscal deficit (the difference between government’s total revenue and expenditure) and outlines strategies for managing public debt.

-Public Finance Transparency: The Budget enhances transparency in public finance by detailing how taxpayers’ money will be utilized, ensuring accountability.

Key Differences:

-Timing and Scope: The Economic Survey precedes the Budget and provides a comprehensive analysis of economic trends and challenges, whereas the Budget outlines financial allocations and policy measures for the upcoming fiscal year.

-Nature of Content: The Economic Survey focuses on economic analysis, trends, and recommendations, while the Budget emphasizes fiscal allocations, revenue generation, and expenditure planning.

-Audience: The Economic Survey is primarily for economists, researchers, and analysts interested in economic trends, while the Budget targets a broader audience including taxpayers, businesses, and investors affected by fiscal policies.

In short, while the Economic Survey offers a diagnosis and prescription for the economy’s health and future direction, the Union Budget translates these insights into concrete fiscal policies and allocations, playing a pivotal role in India’s economic governance and development strategy.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-what-is-the-difference-between-economic-survey-and-budget-explained-3559465/
thehindu.com,"Budget 2024: JNU, DU hope for increased education funding to boost innovation, entrepreneurship","As the nation gears up for Budget 2024-25, the vice-chancellors of Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University expressed hope for increased investment in education to boost entrepreneurship, and innovation, and help the country become a knowledge power. Some experts in the education sector also urged the government to reduce the GST slab on educational products and services from 18% to 5%.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23. This is going to be the first Budget of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after they won the Lok Sabha Elections 2024.

Speaking to ANI ahead of the budget, Delhi University Vice Chancellor Yogesh Singh felt the need for more debates on investing in education. “There is always a need to invest more in education, there is no debate on that. We are very happy and waiting for the Union Budget. When it comes to the University of Delhi, we are getting adequate grants from the Government of India. Last year also we received adequate funding from the Government. There is always a need to invest more in education, there is no debate on that,” he said. “When we have taken a ‘Sankalp’ for Viksit Bharat by 2047, this will not happen without the active participation of higher education of our country,” he noted.

Echoing similar sentiments, JNU Vice-Chancellor Prof. Santishree Dhulipudi Pandit said, “To become a knowledge power, the investment in education has to grow. If the best education is given to all, it makes a huge difference on the impact and quality of graduates who can compete nationally and internationally.”

Other experts in the education sector urged the government to elevate the investment in education. The ed-tech sector anticipates increased funding and supportive policies that can drive significant advancements in educational technology. Aarul Malaviya, founder of Zamit (an AI-driven ed-tech platform) believes that this budget presents an opportunity to address these needs by allocating funds towards enhancing internet connectivity, providing modern devices, and ensuring that both teachers and students are well-equipped to leverage these technologies.

“We also hope to see initiatives that promote innovative learning technologies, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and personalised learning platforms,” Mr. Malaviya said.

Meanwhile, Praveen Singh, CEO at AASOKA by MBD Group (an innovative blended learning solution) called for transforming school and college systems. “However, to truly foster educational innovation and transformation, the government must increase the education sector’s budget and reduce the GST slab from 18% to 5% on educational products and services. This reduction will vastly improve access to affordable and high-quality education for all,” he added. He also said lowering the GST rate on upskilling programmes in the upcoming Union Budget will democratise access to quality education, fostering innovation and employability.",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-jnu-du-hope-for-increased-education-funding/article68425132.ece
thehindu.com,Union Budget 2024: Kerala hopes for a better deal this time,"Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal on July 20 voiced Kerala’s expectations for a better deal in the Union Budget this time, expressing his hope that the changed political situation in the country would pressure the Centre to pay more attention to welfare-oriented measures.

Topping State’s wish-list is a ₹24,000 crore special economic package “to tide over the current liquidity stress by scheduling it over a period of 2 years from 2024-25.” Going over the wish-list ahead of Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget presentation on July 23 (Tuesday), Mr. Balagopal said the State government has not plucked the figure, ₹24,000 crore, out of the air. Rather, it is meant to fill the gap caused by the cuts in the State’s borrowing limit during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 fiscals, Mr. Balagopal added.

Mr. Balagopal had presented the State’s demands at the pre-Budget consultation held by Ms. Sitharaman in New Delhi June.

Among the State’s demands include a ₹5,000 crore ‘special assistance’ for the Vizhinjam international seaport project, and an unconditional permission to borrow ₹6,000 crore in the current fiscal in lieu of the money spent on loan acquisition by the State for National Highway development. Kerala had urged the Centre to treat the ₹5,580 crore spent by the State thus far as additional capital expenditure for national highway.

In the rail sector, Kerala has sought speedy clearance for the SilverLine semi-high speed rail project, surveys DPR preparation for the Thalassery-Mysuru and Nilambur-Nanjangud rail lines and more express and passenger trains.

Kerala has also reiterated its demand for an All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), and the Kannur International Ayurveda Research Institute. For the ailing rubber sector, the State has urged the Centre to raise the support price to ₹250 per kg.

“Our demand for an AIIMS is fully justified. Our request has been pending for 10 years. For a State like Kerala, an AIIMS should been sanctioned long ago,” he said.

On Saturday, Mr. Balagopal also drew attention to the large sums pending from the Centre towards health grant (₹725 crore), grants for local bodies (₹513 crore) and the National Health Mission (₹636 crore).",Left,nan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/union-budget-2024-kerala-hopes-for-a-better-deal-this-time/article68425883.ece

financialexpress.com,What can we expect from Union Budget 2024?,"By- Preeti Gupta

The start of Union Budget season catches the attention of individual taxpayers. The expectations from Budget 2024 are no different. Once again, individual taxpayers are keeping their fingers crossed, hoping for income-tax reliefs in this highly inflationary environment.

In the past few years, the focus of the government has been on easing compliance, reducing litigation and enhancing overall tax administration efficiency in India. As a result, a simplified New Tax Regime was introduced in 2020. Since then, the government has brought in several changes to make the new tax regime more attractive for taxpayers, such as higher basic exemption limit of INR 3 lakh, wider tax slabs, reduced surcharge of 25% on incomes above INR 5 crore, allowing standard deduction and increased rebate. The government is expected to introduce more changes in the new tax regime to make it even more appealing to taxpayers who are still opting for the old tax regime. This may involve either further relaxing the slabs by widening them or restructuring them. Currently, 30% tax rate is applicable on income above INR 15 lakhs. This may be increased to INR 20 lakh.

Income Tax Returns: THIS platform makes ITR filing as easy as WhatsApp messaging | Know who and how can file returns

Increasing the limit under Section 80C has been a longstanding demand from taxpayers and financial experts in India. Section 80C allows individuals to claim deductions from their taxable income by investing in specified instruments and expenses. The current limit of INR 1.5 lakh has remained unchanged since 2014 despite inflation and rising living costs, leading to calls for its revision. To incentivize saving and investment and to keep up with the inflation rates, the government may consider increasing the deduction limit under Section 80C from INR 1.5 lakh to at least INR 2 lakh.

On similar lines, the existing standard deduction of INR 50,000 does not adequately cover the rising cost of living and may be increased to INR 1 lakh-1.25 lakh, which will be a significant relief to salaried taxpayers.

Healthcare expenses, including insurance premiums, have been increasing rapidly. Section 80D allows individuals to claim deductions for health insurance premiums paid for themselves, their spouse, children, and parents. Under the current scenario, a deduction of up to INR 25,000 is allowed for premiums paid for self, spouse and dependent children. An additional deduction of up to INR 25,000 (INR 50,000 in case of senior citizen parents) is allowed for premiums paid for parents. An increase in the Section 80D limit in the Union Budget would allow taxpayers to purchase higher coverage health insurance policies, ensuring better financial protection against medical emergencies. Further, bringing medical insurance premiums under a lower GST tax rate bracket (currently 18%) would make it more affordable.

The House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption rule under the Income Tax Act is indeed a topic of interest and has been the subject of various discussions and proposals for revision. The existing HRA exemption limit was set decades ago and calls for a revamp owing to the fact that rental payments in recent times have been skyrocketing in both metro as well as non-metro cities. Currently, only Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai qualify as metro cities eligible for HRA exemption of 50% of salary. However, rentals in other major cities such as Gurgaon, Bangalore, Hyderabad, etc., have increased significantly in recent times. Thus, it is about time that other major cities are also included in definition of metro cities to qualify for exemption of 50% of salary.

The real estate sector plays a crucial role in economic growth through employment generation and infrastructure development. With the ever-increasing property prices and interest rates, homebuyers incur substantial interest payments. Increasing the deduction limit under Section 24(b) from INR 2 lakh to at least 3 lakh would provide financial relief and make homeownership more feasible. Further, Section 80EEA provides an additional deduction of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh on interest paid for home loans sanctioned between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2022, for first-time homebuyers in the affordable housing segment. The government may plan to reintroduce the benefit under Section 80EEA, till March 2026, to give a much-required boost to the affordable housing segment.

All in all, individual taxpayers have high hopes from the upcoming Budget proposals expecting it to provide some relief to their pockets. It needs to be seen what the government brings to the table to manage the expectations of individual taxpayers.

financialexpress.com,Student Loan Woes and Taxes: Can the Budget 2024 offer financial relief?,"Education is the premise of progress in every society, in every family. Obtaining best quality higher education is increasingly becoming a top priority for both children and parents across the globe. Having said that, the cost of higher education has increased significantly in recent years, making it difficult for many families to afford them. This has indeed led to a rise in the number of students/parents opting for education loans to fund their higher education in India or outside India. In addition to the tuition fees, education loans help cover other ever-increasing costs such as accommodation, travel for education, books and other essentials.

While education loan helps in bridging the gap between aspiration and affordability, it can pose several practical challenges and woes for students and their families. Some common issues faced by applicants include stringent eligibility criteria, collateral requirements, high interest rates, limited loan amounts, documentation hassles, repayment terms, preference for specified courses and institutions, credit history requirements and change in government regulations. Navigating these challenges requires thorough research, financial planning and proactive communication with lenders, to arrive at an informed decision.

Despite the practical challenges and difficulties associated with obtaining an education loan, one silver lining in the cloud is the tax relief provided under Section 80E of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The interest portion of the EMI paid on education loans availed from specified institutions for the purpose of pursuing higher education, qualify for deduction under Section 80E of the Income-tax Act. Some important aspects to claim deduction are provided below:

Eligibility: Available only to an individual who has taken loan for the higher education of self, spouse, children or for a student for whom the individual is a legal guardian.

Available only to an individual who has taken loan for the higher education of self, spouse, children or for a student for whom the individual is a legal guardian. Lending institution: Loan availed only from a financial institution, or an approved charitable institution qualify for deduction.

Loan availed only from a financial institution, or an approved charitable institution qualify for deduction. Duration: Deduction available for a maximum of 8 consecutive tax years, starting from the year in which repayment of loan begins.

Deduction available for a maximum of 8 consecutive tax years, starting from the year in which repayment of loan begins. Purpose: For pursuing higher education in India as well as outside India

For pursuing higher education in India as well as outside India Maximum amount of deduction: Unlike some other deductions which have a capped limit, there is no upper limit on the amount of interest that can be claimed as a deduction, making it particularly beneficial for borrowers with high loan amounts and significant interest payments.

Unlike some other deductions which have a capped limit, there is no upper limit on the amount of interest that can be claimed as a deduction, making it particularly beneficial for borrowers with high loan amounts and significant interest payments. Tax Regime: Available only to the individuals opting for old tax regime.

Another essential factor associated with education loans is Tax Collected at Source (‘TCS’). TCS is applied by the Indian government to track the money being sent out of India under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (‘LRS’). It is the tax to be paid when money is being sent overseas for education. Now such TCS is bifurcated and classified, as detailed in the following sentences. There is no TCS for the first INR 7 lakh remitted for education purposes. The moment the remittance (including living expenses such as food, clothing, tickets etc. for the student) goes beyond INR 7 lakhs, a TCS of 5% is applied. However, if the remittance is financed by a loan, a TCS rate of 0.5% is applicable. For any overseas remittance being made for reasons other than above, the TCS rate goes up to 20% which is a substantial number.

Having said this, credit of TCS can be claimed at the time of filing the Income-tax return, making it only a temporary cash flow factor rather than a sunk cost.

In the Interim Budget 2024, the Finance Minister made the highest ever allocation for the department of school education and literacy. Now with the full Union Budget 2024 around the corner, one may expect some relief related towards interest rates on higher education loans considering it will significantly impact the affordability of education for Indian students and their families. However, any relief towards TCS on remittances for overseas education is highly unlikely. So, guardians need to be prepared for an impact on the overall funds flow with some relief available for loan deduction and delayed refund of TCS funds.

financialexpress.com,What India’s salaried class hopes for in the Budget 2024?,"Budget Day in India is typically filled with a whirlwind of emotions such as anxiety, surprise, nervousness and so on. Different stakeholders have different expectations from the Budget. For the salaried class the expectations revolve around tax relief – deductions/exemptions, better rate of returns and measures that can reduce prices of commodities.

It is important to note that there were no major announcements in the interim budget of February 2024 as it was only a vote on account. Therefore, all eyes and ears will be on the Union Budget 2024 scheduled for July 22. Some key expectations of the salaried taxpayers are mentioned below.

1. Increase in basic exemption limit

During Budget 2020, the government announced the introduction of a new simplified tax regime (which is now the default tax regime) and increased the basic exemption limit gradually. This regime benefits taxpayers who do not currently claim deductions for investments. Consequently, they are not obligated to submit investment documentation to their employers as well. It is also an agreed position that a substantial share of a salaried taxpayer’s income is incurred in expenses such as housing loan repayments, life and health insurance premiums, etc. When it comes to the old regime, the last revision was done in FY 2014-15, marking a decade since the last revision. While incomes of salaried taxpayers has risen over the decade, the basic exemption limit has remained at the same level. Hence, it may be reasonable to expect the limit to be revised to INR 5 lakhs for both the tax regimes.

2. Increase in 80C limit

While recent policy changes suggest a shift towards the new tax regime, a majority of salaried taxpayers have investments qualifying for deductions and hence prefer the old tax regime. Similar to the change to the basic exemption limit, the last increase to the 80C deduction under the old tax regime happened in FY 2014-2015. Over the past decade, cost of living has increased causing a strain on the common man’s wallet. Even with the hike in salary, this section remains committed to investing in avenues such as LIC, Provident Fund contributions, Equity Linked Savings Scheme, Public Provident Fund, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, National Savings Certificate, Fixed Deposits etc., amidst inflationary pressures. In light of the above changes, a revision in the 80C deduction limit from INR 1.5 lakhs to INR 2 lakhs would be well received by salaried taxpayers.

3. Standard deduction

Budget 2018 witnessed a change in the tax landscape where transport allowance and medical reimbursement were replaced with a standard deduction of INR 40,000. This meant that the salaried taxpayer need not produce any bills (required for medical reimbursement) and was eligible for a blanket deduction. The limit of standard deduction was further increased to INR 50,000 in Budget 2019. This was subsequently extended to taxpayers opting for the new tax regime in last year’s budget. While this has been welcomed by salaried taxpayers, there is also the expectation for a further increase in the limit to INR 1 lakh for new tax regime users and INR 70,000 for old tax regime users.

4. Capital gains tax

For a salaried taxpayer, any decrease in capital gains tax wouldn’t necessarily translate to immediate savings. It is irrefutable that a substantial segment of our nation’s population, actively engages in the securities market. Previously, the sale of long-term capital gains from listed equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds was exempt from taxation. However, Budget 2018 introduced the tax regime for such capital gains exceeding INR 1 lakh. The past few years have been characterized by a robust growth in the stock market leading to a substantial increase in many stocks and investment units. Hence, increasing the threshold limit for capital gains tax from INR 1 lakh to INR 2 lakhs, would help maintain the tax in line with the market growth and reduce the tax burden of such investors.

5. Interest paid on housing loan

Owning a house is the dream and aspiration of every person and salaried taxpayers are no exception. To achieve this goal, many have secured, or will likely secure, financing through bank loans. However, it is important to acknowledge that not only have property values increased over the years, interest rates too have risen on such loans. Given the front-loaded nature of many loan structures, interest payments incurred during the initial years may be subject to a higher effective interest rate. As a result, the total interest paid during this period could surpass the limit allowable under the Act. It is pertinent to note that the maximum interest that could be claimed was last increased from INR 1.5 lakhs to INR 2 lakhs during the FY 2014-15. Hence, raising this limit to INR 4 – 5 lakhs (considering the current market situation) could help taxpayer in reducing their tax outflow. While the above would only benefit taxpayers opting for old tax regime, taxpayers who have opted for the new tax regime expect the deduction should also be offered to them as well, since the interest paid on housing loans represents a significant financial burden for most taxpayers, regardless of the chosen tax regime.

6 Procedural alignment of AIS before filing tax return

Parallel to Form 26AS, the Income tax Department rolled out the Annual Information Statement (AIS) during 2021. The AIS is a comprehensive statement which includes additional information related to interest, dividends, securities, transactions, mutual fund transactions, foreign remittance information, advance tax / self-assessment tax etc. Due to its reliance on information provided by third parties and their e-TDS filings, the AIS update process may not guarantee complete data accuracy by the tax return filing deadline. Therefore, a system is needed to ensure streamlined data is available by May 31st, allowing taxpayers to file returns with complete information.

Having said all of that, one fervently hopes the above expectations of the salaried taxpayer will be considered by the government. Even if only a select few of these expectations are addressed in the upcoming budget, it would serve to enhance the morale and financial well-being of salaried taxpayers and potentially lead to a sense of optimism regarding the following year’s fiscal budget.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Study calls for ‘urgent’ need to double agriculture R&D budget – What will be its impact?,"There is an urgent need to double the current budgetary allocation for agricultural research and development to enhance its impact, the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) stated in a quarterly bulletin released ahead of the upcoming Union Budget 2024. The bulletin further indicated that to accomplish this goal, the budget for agricultural research and development expenditure (ARDE) needs to be almost doubled from the current Rs 9,941 crore allocated to the Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE) within the next 2-3 years.

High ROI in agri research

The bulletin underscored that previous studies have demonstrated the high return on investment in agricultural research. Each rupee invested yields a return of 11.2, significantly higher than investments in fertilizer subsidies (0.88), power subsidies (0.79), education (0.97), or roads (1.10). “Therefore, reallocating funds from fertilizer and power subsidies to agricultural R&D could significantly enhance food and nutritional security amid climate change challenges,” the bulletin, edited by agricultural economist Ashok Gulati, said.

The report also stresses the importance of translating research into practical applications. Since 2014, under the aegis of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the National Agricultural Research System has released 2,380 varieties of various field crops, with 1,971 being climate-resilient.

Despite these efforts, the agricultural GDP growth has been adversely affected by extreme weather events like the El Nino in 2013, which reduced agri-GDP growth to 1.4% in FY24 from 4.7% in FY23. “We need some satisfactory answers to this. One plausible answer is that whatever has been done so far is not enough to protect Indian agriculture from extreme weather events. Or, there is a serious lack of extension-related activities that may have aided in research moving from lab to land,” the report said.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-study-calls-for-urgent-need-to-double-agriculture-rampd-budget-what-will-be-its-impact-3559515/

ndtv.com,Union Budget 2024: These Are The Likely Winners And Losers,"Union Budget: The government and regulators also want to rein derivatives trading

The government unveils its budget on July 23 in the first major policy announcement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third five-year term, which could usher in changes to economic priorities.

After a shock election result saw the BJP returned to power relying on allies, the government is expected to boost consumption by lowering personal taxes or increasing spending on consumer-focused areas.

While that could benefit consumer goods makers, real estate and housing finance firms as well as infrastructure and auto companies, some sectors could also stand to lose, said brokerages.

Here are some of their winners and losers.

RURAL-LINKED SECTORS

The government is expected to allocate more funds for rural schemes to stimulate consumption, aiding consumer goods makers like Hindustan Unilever and two-wheeler makers like TVS Motor and Hero MotoCorp, according to Citi.

A less than 5%-7% increase in tobacco taxes could be a positive for ITC, the country's largest cigarette maker, according to Jefferies.

REAL ESTATE

The government is likely to allocate more funds for affordable housing, benefitting developers such as Macrotech Developers and Sunteck Realty, Citi said.

Moreover, the introduction of an interest subsidy scheme for urban housing would boost financiers like Aavas Financiers and Home First Finance, said Jefferies.

AUTOMAKERS

The government doled out subsidies worth 115 billion rupees ($1.38 billion) over five years to drive the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and Macquarie expects the government to retain both the quantum and tenure in its latest scheme.

That could benefit Tata Motors, India's top e-car maker, as well as IPO-bound e-scooter maker Ola Electric and e-bus makers Olectra Greentech and JBM Auto.

Conversely, lesser-than-expected EV subsidies could benefit Maruti Suzuki, India's highest-selling car maker and one that has chosen to make hybrid cars over pure EVs.

MANUFACTURING

The push on production-linked incentive schemes, which incentivises local manufacturing and creates jobs, is expected to continue, according to HSBC.

That will help manufacturers of technology hardware, telecom equipment, electronics and medical devices among others, like Dixon Technologies, Ideaforge Technology, Biocon.

Capital goods companies like Larsen & Toubro and infrastructure firms could benefit from the likely rise in capital expenditure in the budget, according to Jefferies.

TRADING

Any change in capital gains tax -- either by raising the holding period or tax rate -- could be a dampener for equities, Morgan Stanley said, though it says such moves are unlikely.

But, if enacted, they would increase the tax burden on equity and mutual fund investors, eroding the tax advantage they enjoy over investors in other asset classes.

It could also lead to lower trading volumes, weighing on brokerages Motilal Oswal, ICICI Securities, Angel One, 5 Paisa among others.

The country's mutual fund association has petitioned that mutual fund units be exempted from long-term capital gains tax.

The government and regulators also want to rein derivatives trading -- which has largely powered the stock market's rally since the COVID-19 pandemic -- calling it risky and speculative.

Any move to do so, such as through higher taxes, will not only weigh on the market but also reduce trading volumes and in turn, affect brokerages and trading platforms, Jefferies said.",Left,nan,https://www.ndtv.com/business-news/union-budget-2024-to-be-presented-on-tuesday-likely-winners-and-losers-6140610
financialexpress.com,7 things Union Budget 2024 can do for salaried taxpayers,"With the upcoming presentation of the Union Budget 2024 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23rd, the salaried class is eagerly anticipating favorable announcements. This includes tax reductions and reforms aimed at simplifying and streamlining taxation processes.

Salaried taxpayers are hopeful for lower income tax rates to alleviate the impact of inflation and rising interest rates. Additionally, they are looking forward to incentives that promote equity investments, such as tax exemptions, leading to higher disposable income. The expectation also extends to the introduction of a more straightforward tax structure and expanded tax exemptions in the budget.

A few expectations of the salaried class from the Union Budget 2024 are outlined below:

1. Rationalization of slab rates

Numerous people anticipate that the government will adjust the income tax slab rates to create a more progressive and fair system. This adjustment has the potential to lower taxes for the middle-income bracket. Additionally, the current maximum surcharge rate in the new tax regime stands at 25%, while in the old tax regime, it is 37%. The benefits offered in the new tax system could possibly be expanded to the old tax system as well.

2. Increase in 80C deduction limit

The government should consider increasing the deduction limit under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act to offer assistance to middle-class taxpayers. Given that the deduction amount was last modified in FY2014-15, remaining at Rs 1.5 lakh for an extended period, an adjustment upwards is well overdue. The deduction is widely considered the most crucial tax benefit for individual taxpayers in the previous tax system. Given the rising cost of living, raising the deduction limit to a minimum of Rs 2 lakh from the current Rs 1.5 lakh would offer significant relief to the majority of salaried individuals.

3. Rationalization of New Tax Regime

It is important to consider extending the deductions available to individuals under the older tax regime, such as health insurance and NPS contributions, to the new tax regime. This will help promote equal access to healthcare and incentivize savings and investments for taxpayers.

Moreover, “an increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in the new tax regime could provide a much-needed impetus to domestic savings,” says Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India.

4. Increase in Standard Deduction limit

The only deduction salaried taxpayers get is a standard deduction of Rs 50,000. Considering the rate of inflation and this limit being fixed for the past many years now, it is a popular expectation to increase the same to at least Rs 1 lakh.

5. Change in House Rent Allowance (HRA) tax exemption rules

HRA continues to be an exemption useful for the salaried class staying on rent specially in cities which is not their home city. “As per the formula for claiming such exemption, only four cities i.e., Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, are eligible for exemption basis 50% of salary. Rest of the places get the exemption basis 40% of salary only. In today’s times cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Gurgaon, Pune etc. have also equally become expensive. Hence, the expectation that HRA rules may be updated in Budget 2024 to include these cities for HRA exemption basis 50% of salary,” suggests Sirwalla.

6. Inclusion of interest on different kinds of bank deposits u/s 80TTA

Salaried individuals often distribute their money across various savings and term deposit accounts in order to maximize their returns. As such, it may be beneficial for the government to consider including interest earned on different types of bank deposits, such as fixed deposits, under section 80TTA. Additionally, raising the threshold for this inclusion from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 could be a favorable decision.

7. Boost to housing

With the aim of achieving housing for all, there is a widespread anticipation that the government might introduce certain tax incentives for housing and reduce funding costs for middle and low-income individuals. Under the current default tax system, interest on housing loans is not deductible for self-occupied properties. In contrast, the previous tax system allows a deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh only. This differentiation is significant as purchasing a home and obtaining a loan for self-occupation are major financial commitments that often last for extended periods. Given the recent increases in interest rates and regulatory changes, the real estate sector is facing growing challenges. To address these issues and promote homeownership, it is recommended that the government reconsider allowing deductions for interest on self-occupied housing loans even under the new default tax system or increase the deduction in the old tax system to at least Rs 3 lakh, according to KPMG in India.

Thus, there are expectations galore from the upcoming Budget 2024. However, whether this time the salaried class is able to get something from the government or not remains to be seen!",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/7-things-union-budget-2024-can-do-for-salaried-taxpayers-3558169/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Real estate looks for much-needed impetus for long-term growth,"The upcoming presentation of the Union Budget 2024-25 on July 23rd has sparked optimism within the real estate sector regarding the Modi 3.0 regime. Anticipation is mounting for potential tax reliefs and other measures to boost market sentiment. The future of the industry hinges on unimpeded infrastructure development to enhance urban living standards and foster the growth of new areas.

Will the government accede to the longstanding request for industry status for the entire housing sector? Will it implement effective measures to revitalize the affordable housing segment, which has been in decline since the onset of the pandemic? Industry experts continue to ponder over these questions.

“The real estate market in India has shown strong performance in 2024 so far, as evidenced by the increasing number of housing sales and new projects in the top 7 cities. Sales have hit a record high of approximately 493,000 units in the fiscal year 2023-2024, while 447,000 units were launched. It is crucial for this positive trend to be sustained in the coming years, especially since the current growth pattern is more focused on mid-range and luxury housing. In order to address the housing needs of lower-income groups in India, there must be a concerted effort to promote affordable housing alongside the high-end market segment,” says Anuj Puri, Chairman, ANAROCK Group.

Numerous incentives that used to be available to buyers and developers of affordable housing have lapsed within the past two years. So, it is crucial to rejuvenate this significant sector through impactful actions such as providing tax incentives to developers to encourage their focus on affordable housing, as well as offering tax breaks to buyers to enhance affordability.

The industry expects a strong focus on infrastructure and innovation to tackle the housing shortage in both rural and urban areas, especially through programs aimed at improving rental housing.

“Potential tax relief, such as changes to income tax exemption limits in the new tax system, could greatly benefit low-income earners. Adjustments to income tax brackets for individuals earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh annually are expected to increase spending power and stimulate economic activity, which is crucial for the middle class. We also predict further support for the affordable housing sector through reinstated PMAY incentives, while GST reforms will be essential for ensuring nationwide accessibility. The budget is likely to maintain its focus on sustainable development and green innovation, promoting environmentally-friendly practices in infrastructure projects,” says Arvind Nandan, Managing Director – Research & Consulting, Savills India.

Looking ahead to the forthcoming budget for 2024-25, there is a clear opportunity to reshape the trajectory of India’s real estate sector.

“An important aspect is the necessity for increased tax benefits for homebuyers and investors. We call upon the government to contemplate raising the deduction limit for interest on home loans from the current Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh annually, a move that could significantly enhance housing demand. Furthermore, reducing the GST on under-construction properties and adjusting raw material prices would serve to further stimulate the market. These adjustments are not only crucial for revitalizing the sector but also for boosting demand in around 250 associated industries,” says Mohit Goel, Managing Director, Omaxe.

The sector also requires improved ease of doing business for developers, which would foster a more favorable investment environment. “Addressing liquidity issues, simplifying regulations, and providing increased funding for affordable and mid-income housing are vital to promoting sustainable growth. Streamlining approval processes and advancing the digitization of land records would lead to substantial reductions in project delays, benefiting both developers and end-users. On the commercial front, incentivizing green building practices and sustainable infrastructure development is imperative for driving urban renewal and attracting additional investment,” Goel adds.

Vikram Singh, President, Central Park, says, “We are optimistic to see certain positives from the upcoming budget for the luxury real estate sector. The current boom in this market reflects the increasing demand from affluent buyers who are looking for elegant residences with modern amenities and exquisite design. The sector’s upward trajectory is further amplified by the continued urbanisation and growing disposable incomes. Moreover, streamlining regulatory approvals for high-end projects would significantly enhance operational efficiency and boost investor confidence, which are both essential for sustained growth in the realty market. Overall, the real estate sector hopes the budget will promote growth, encourage investment and make home buying altogether more accessible.”

Enabling Indian investors to engage more extensively in global markets is also the need of the hour.

Ritu Kant Ojha, CEO of the Dubai-based Proact Luxury Real Estate, says, “We expect that the forthcoming Union Budget will introduce changes that will enable Indian investors to engage more extensively in global markets. The current 20% Tax Collected at Source on foreign real estate investments, as mandated by the Liberalised Remittance Scheme, limits their ability to take advantage of international opportunities. Reducing this rate to 5% would not only expand the amount of capital available but also facilitate wider portfolio diversification overseas, thereby enhancing India’s presence in international markets. These adjustments are crucial as we strive for a $5 trillion economy and endeavor to harmonize with the tax regulations of developed countries.”

The forthcoming budget has the potential to significantly impact the affordability of Indian real estate.

“With a shortage of 29 million units, 90% of which are in the affordable housing segment, we anticipate substantial measures to stimulate supply and demand. Additionally, the proposed increase of tax rebate on interest on housing loan under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act will facilitate easier access to home ownership for the middle class. Furthermore, granting industry status to the entire real estate sector, not just affordable housing, could reduce borrowing costs by 2-3 percent, potentially leading to lower home prices. Given that India’s urban population is projected to reach 600 million by 2030, the budget should establish a foundation for sustainable and affordable urban housing growth,” suggests LC Mittal, Director, Motia Group.

Gunjan Goel, Director at Goel Ganga Developments, says, “The real estate industry is currently facing a crucial moment, with the budget having the potential to greatly impact affordability. We are seeking solutions to tackle the liquidity challenges that developers are experiencing, resulting in the halt of numerous projects. The SWAMIH fund has already approved Rs 12,000 crore for 130 projects, highlighting the need for more effective mechanisms. Extending the CLSS scheme will undoubtedly boost demand for affordable housing. With recent data showing a 5% year-on-year decrease in housing sales in major cities, it is imperative to implement strong fiscal policies to rejuvenate the sector. One such policy could involve raising the price limit to ₹45 lakh for metro cities, enabling more projects to qualify for lower GST rates and additional subsidies for developers and homebuyers.”

The impact of the Budget on real estate affordability will largely depend on its effectiveness in addressing supply- and demand-side challenges.

“Streamlining approval processes and reducing the number of permits required, which currently stands at around 35, can significantly cut project timelines and costs. On the demand side, revising the cap on capital gains tax exemption for reinvestment in two houses will provide a boost, particularly for Metro markets experiencing higher prices. With the real estate sector’s contribution to GDP at 6-7%, projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, budgetary support is crucial. Additionally, the GST input tax credit for under-construction properties has the potential to lower house prices by 5-7%, making homeownership more attainable for many,” says Aman Gupta, Director, RPS Group.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-real-estate-looks-for-much-needed-impetus-for-long-term-growth-3558665/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectation: Education sector calls for higher allocation and faster implementation of NEP,"As the Union Budget 2024 is around the corner, the education sector urges the government to elevate the investment in education. Experts from the education sector believe that if India aims to position itself as a developed economy in the next two decades in alignment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’, it is crucial to prioritise the education of children, the true architects of our nation’s destiny. “The proposed increase from 2.9% to 6% in the upcoming budget is not just a financial commitment but a strategic move towards empowering our youth with the skills and knowledge required to lead the nation into a prosperous future. By prioritising education, we are laying the foundation for an innovative and globally competitive India,” Manish Rastogi, Whole-Time Director and Chief Executive Officer, Zee Learn Ltd, said.

Linking teachers’ salaries to their qualifications is a strategy designed to promote ongoing professional development throughout their careers. This approach not only aims to elevate the quality of education but also rewards educators for their commitment to growth, as per the experts. “Essential to this strategy are robust teacher training programmes, regular assessments and feedback mechanisms involving parents and students. Transparent reporting systems are also crucial, as they help address any deviations in educational quality through continuous monitoring and feedback loops,” Rastogi added.

Reflecting on the current educational landscape, Aishwarya Rao, Director of The Vivekalaya Group of Institutions, highlights the significance of recent budgetary allocations. She states, “Our expectations are shaped by the recent trends and significant allocations in the education sector. The notable increase to Rs 68,805 crore for school education and Rs 44,095 crore for higher education in the 2023 budget reflects a commendable commitment to strengthening our educational framework. We hope to see this trend continue, particularly with a focus on augmenting digital infrastructure and teacher training programmes. These are critical areas that require substantial investment to ensure equitable and quality education for all students.

Adding to that she said, “We anticipate targeted funding for innovative educational technologies and inclusive education initiatives, which are essential for preparing our students to thrive in a rapidly evolving global landscape.”

On the other hand, Kunal Vasudeva, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Indian School of Hospitality, stresses the urgency of accelerating the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. He warns, “After the introduction of the NEP 2020, it is crucial to accelerate its implementation. Without swift action, we risk stagnation in our educational advancements and miss the opportunity to prepare our students for a rapidly evolving global landscape.”

He further believes that Institutions, particularly niche ones, must be granted autonomy swiftly with appropriate safeguards in place. This autonomy is vital for the nation’s growth, especially in specialised sectors. If this does not happen now, we face the danger of stifling innovation and falling behind in global competitiveness.

Looking ahead, we advocate for the introduction of targeted schemes and increased budgetary allocations in crucial areas such as Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), teacher training and the development of skill-based courses for K-12 students. These strategic investments are essential for cultivating a strong and dynamic educational ecosystem, Rastogi stated.",Center,nan,https://www.financialexpress.com/jobs-career/education/budget-2024-expectation-education-sector-calls-for-higher-allocation-and-faster-implementation-of-nep/3558488/
