financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Impact of proposals and tax changes on propensity to save,"By Dr Sarika Rachuri and Dr Badri Narayanan

Every year, the finance minister presents a Union budget, which is not only a fiscal arithmetic but also a powerful and potent tool to allocate scarce resources to different sectors. It influences the different vectors of aggregate demand: Consumption, Investment, Government Expenditure, and Net Exports. The implicit and underpinning outcome of the union budget which is often not articulated is a default choice architecture of these public policies, that it creates for the public. All public policies provide a nudge in banning undesirable outcomes, (huge tax incidence on cigarettes) while promoting desirable ones (incentivising savings), channelising investments for underdeveloped regions, or even to promote balanced growth. One of the central themes of public finance and union budget is its ability to save and invest. Taxation plays a defining role in people’s ability and inclination to save and invest.

Tax Provisions

From time to time various tax provisions first enunciated in the budget, have provided tax rebates and exemption to the public. Section 88 allowed individuals to claim tax under PPF, NSC, life insurance premiums, Infrastructure bonds, and the like. This was supplemented by Section 80C, which expanded more options for the public to invest. Section 80C was the proverbial nudge to consumers to increase propensity to save and invest.



A tax prayer could claim exemption until Rs. 1.5 lakhs. There has been a steady rise in the number of tax payers from 2.69 crores in 2005-06 to 3.36 crores in 2013 to 6.77 crores on 31 July 2023, and many of these tax payers have enjoyed exemptions. Further, Income Tax provisions also helped tax payers to avail deductions for interest on home loans. Section 80EEA of theIncome Tax Act, 1961, came into effect from April 1, 2020. It allows a deduction for interest on a loan taken for specific house property. The Indian government provides tax benefits on home loans, primarily through deductions on the principal repayment and interest payment components. These tax incentives reduce the overall cost of homeownership, making it more affordable to borrowers.

According to Reserve Bank’s data, credit outstanding to the housing sector, primarily comprising home loans, has increased significantly by Rs 10 lakh crore during the last two years to a staggering Rs 27.22 lakh crore as of March 2024, marking a noteworthy rise from Rs 17.26 lakh crore recorded at the end of March 2022.

The July 2024 budget has changed all that. It has removed the indexation benefit available to asset classes like real estate and brought down the capital gains tax to 12.5% from the 20% with indexation available earlier.

Fig 3: New Tax treatment

This has ignited a debate on the purpose behind the government’s move, and its impact.

Impact of LTCG

A BankBazaar study used RBI’s House Price Index data for 10 major cities and found out that LTCG taxes on an average, increases 2.9 times without the indexation benefit. This study is based on RBI’s House Price Index (2011-2024) and the Cost Inflation Index. This report showed that without indexation, the long-term capital gains taxes rise significantly for all holding periods. The simulated holding periods for LTCG calculations in the study, range from 2 years to 13 years ending in March 2024. The report also shows that longer holding periods correlate with higher taxes with or without indexation. With indexation, the taxes are comparatively higher.



Another finding of the report is that the average indexed tax on LTCG in these 13 years (2010-2023) is 3.90. The report also shows that this average non-indexed tax rises 2.90 times to 11.34, implying additional taxes of 7.44. The report suggests that all taxes with indexation were 0 from 2016-17 whereas without indexation, the taxes rose considerably with values of 3.02 to 8.70. The report shows that because of indexation, there is no long-term capital gains from 2016-17. These seven years show long-term capital losses. Therefore, despite the 20 percent tax rate, the investor’s tax liability would be zero in these years. However, without indexation, there are huge leaps in the LTCG for all years including from 2016-17.

Impact on Savings

An NIPFP study estimates the effect of being in a taxable income bracket on the probability of having investments in specific financial products. They do this by examining portfolio formation using the CMIE Consumer Pyramids Household Survey Data for 2016–173. They find that the probability of investments in tax-favoured financial products is higher for households that are taxed. A disaggregated analysis of salaried households suggests that the tax-incentivised impact on saving is highest for salaried households in the income bracket of Rs 350,000 to Rs 500,000.

For households not subject to tax liability, household characteristics drive the probability of investments in insurance products. Thus, while aggregate financial saving has remained stable, tax breaks have been influential in driving savings into specific products, such as insurance and pensions. Till recently, physical savings of households were increasing. Now, with this new change in Long Term Capital Gains, there will be an impact.

Fig 4: Savings in physical assets

An appraisal of a capital gains tax includes particularly its effect on investment. Investment is one of the most important variables in economic development, and capital gains taxation is directly related to the supply of savings, the composition of investments, and the mobility of capital.

Conclusion

The union budget in the last few decades has played a defining role in providing through its provisions a discernible nudge to build public savings, the tax incentives due to savings have been provided across all asset classes, the PPF savings which are tax exempt indirectly support the bond markets, since a great chunk goes in investment in government securities. Other tax provisions have given tax exemptions in Equity-linked schemes. ULIPs are a dual instrument to help to insure and save. In few years reality sector got a boost, where money from the sale of property was incentivised to be invested back in the realty sector. Exempting interest on housing loans from taxation, and provision of tax treatment of repaying principal amount to be included for tax exemption. All this has helped real estate as an asset class to grow.

The history of incentivising savings, has since decades inculcated the habit of thrift among middle-class and lower-middle-class Indians. This has been the anchor and nest egg for the working-class population of India. Unlike the developed world, there exists no social security mechanism to buffer the middle class and poor. At best by incentivising savings the government nudged and encouraged the propensity to save. However, the new tax provision provides no such incentives. A demographic dividend where a large population is entering the workforce, will be left with no nudge to save is a failing indeed.

financialexpress.com,Explaining Budget 2024 announcements on GST and custom duty,"– By Manish Mishra and Tanay Vyas

The tax proposals contained in the Union Budget recently tabled before the parliament largely aim at bolstering domestic manufacturing, improving ease of doing business, reducing litigation and providing certainty in tax administration.

On the Import duty front, the emphasis is to boost domestic manufacturing, in line with the ‘Make in India’ and ‘Aatmnirbhar Bharat’ initiatives through rationalization of the Customs duty rates. Keeping in line with these objectives, certain exemptions are extended till March 2026 and 2029 respectively, whereas certain others are allowed to lapse on September 30, 2024. The rationalization of import tariffs is expected to continue further with a comprehensive review of the tariff structure announced to be undertaken in the next six months.



On the specific proposals, reduction in duty rates on mobile phones including their parts and accessories are aimed at incentivizing domestic manufacture as well as reducing prices for the end-customers. Exemptions extended to precious metals (gold, silver, platinum) along with ores and concentrates of copper, cobalt, tin and tungsten etc. as well as silicon to boost investment and manufacturing in the related sectors. In the healthcare sector, exemptions have been extended to certain life-saving drugs used for cancer treatment and polyethylene used in orthopaedic implants.

For the renewable sector, basic customs duty is increased on solar glass for manufacture of solar cells from Nil to 10%. This is neutralized by providing exemption on certain capital goods and their parts and extending the exemptions on import of certain critical goods used in manufacture of solar cells and modules. This is expected to incentivize manufacturing of solar cells and modules in India.

Benefits under the MOOWR scheme, which allows manufacturing operations to be carried out in bonded warehouses with duty-free imports of raw material and capital goods, are proposed to be restricted for specific sectors. While this step seems to be undertaken due to certain court pronouncements for the solar power sector, the same appears to be retrograde and does not send out positive signals to the investors. This should have been avoided, given the scheme has provided a significant boost to investment in the manufacturing sector.

There are certain other steps announced to facilitate trade and resolve disputes, such as providing retrospective exemption from levy of GST Compensation Cess on imports by SEZ units, extension of time limits for duty free re-imports and relaxed documentation in support of establishing country of origin in respect of imports under the free/ preferential trade agreements. However, one wonders if a dispute resolution scheme should have been announced to resolve pending customs duty litigation.

From a GST perspective, the focus seems to create more certainty in the tax administration and dispute resolution, considering the massive surge in the GST litigation. The tone was set through various clarifications issued by the Government post the 53rd GST Council meeting and the same is furthered in the proposals.

Rationalization in the adjudication processes in relation to Notices issued for FY 2024-25 onwards, waiver in interest and penalties subject to voluntary payment of taxes for initial years of GST, consideration of industry practices for resolution of disputes, retrospective extension in the dates for availment of ITC and announcement of a sunset clause for anti-profiteering provisions are steps in the right direction which should be welcomed by the Industry.

While infrastructure was stated to be one of the focus sectors, surprisingly there is not much of a change in the rate structure for the sector and status-quo is maintained. It was widely speculated that steps may be taken to address the issue of duty inversion faced by the sector, given that the output from the sector generally enjoys exemption or lower rate of GST whereas procurements suffer tax at median rate of eighteen percent leading to credit accumulation. A ‘deemed export’ status for the sector could be considered, whereby supplies by the sector may be eligible for refund or rebate of such accumulated credits.

To sum up, while the indirect tax proposals contained in the Budget aim at creating a taxpayer friendly environment by focussing on ease of compliances and dispute resolution, it appears that Government has stopped short on taking affirmative measures which could have provided impetus to investments in key sectors and eased the burden of GST on the end consumers. However, given that this was the first budget for the newly elected Government, it certainly sets out the tone for future steps that may be undertaken in this regard in the times to come.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024 rekindles hope for reforms in real estate,"The Union Budget 2024 was being called the ‘Budget of Hope’ not without reason. Amidst economic fluctuations and pricing challenges, this budget marks a significant step forward, introducing key reforms and increased funding that promise to reshape the real estate industry’s landscape.

The budget has introduced a number of key reforms, addressing the sector’s long-standing issues while simultaneously pushing for growth and development. However, real estate developers and investors find themselves cautiously optimistic and would be closely observing on how these reforms are implemented.

One of the most notable changes is the reduction in long-term Capital Gains Tax. This move, aimed at simplifying the tax structure, comes with a trade-off: the removal of indexation benefits. While this may cause some initial concern among investors, the overall impact is expected to stimulate market activity. The ambitious plan to construct 3 crore additional houses in urban and rural areas stands as a testament to the government’s commitment to affordable housing. This initiative, coupled with the Urban 2.0 program investing Rs 10 lakh crore for 1 crore urban families, presents a ray of hope for both the working class and developers. However, the industry would have some scepticism with regards to the intensity of these impact of these measures on the developers.





Urban development takes center stage in this budget, with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) seeing a substantial increase in allocation from Rs 69,270.72 crore in FY2023-24 to Rs 82,576.57 crore for FY2024-25. This boost underscores the government’s vision of cities as growth hubs and urban development as a key priority. In a move towards inclusivity, the budget announces reductions in stamp duties and special considerations for women homeowners. This progressive step is expected to open up new market segments and encourage wider participation in property ownership. Digitization emerges as a crucial theme, with the implementation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) set to revolutionize transactions between buyers and builders. The allocation of Rs 1150.02 crore for the National Urban Digital Mission further emphasizes the Government’s commitment to modernizing the sector.

Despite these positive developments, the real estate industry’s long-standing demand for ‘Industry Status’ remains unaddressed. The absence of this recognition, along with the lack of GST rationalization, continues to create challenges in offering competitive pricing to buyers. Many industry experts argue that granting industry status could be the key to unlocking the sector’s full potential.

As we look to the future, the 2024 Union Budget sets a hopeful tone for real estate in India. While it may not have delivered on all fronts, it has certainly laid the groundwork for significant growth and development. The ambitious housing initiatives and focus on urban development paint a promising picture, but there’s still room for further dialogue on policy reforms.

The coming months will be crucial as the industry adapts to these changes and continues to push for additional reforms. For now, stakeholders in the real estate sector can take heart in the government’s clear signal of support and commitment to progress. The journey towards a fully reformed and vibrant real estate market continues, one budget at a time.

financialexpress.com,Critical Minerals in the Union Budget 2024-2025: Steering through the Headwinds,"By Araudra Singh

The growing significance of critical minerals across the international community, including for developing economies like India cannot be overstated. Imperatives of India’s industrialization and Sustainable Development Goals have amplified the nation’s reliance on these minerals. With their applicability in sectors ranging from high tech and telecommunications to renewables and defence, the Economic Survey of 2022-23 deemed the critical minerals as an upcoming “geopolitical battleground”, signs of which are already apparent. The salience of these indispensable reserves is not only evident by New Delhi’s international engagement in the recent past but also by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s recent Union Budget speech in Lok Sabha.

Plans Charted in the Union Budget

The Finance Minister stated the government’s intentions to set up a Critical Mineral Mission for domestic production, recycling, and overseas acquisition of critical minerals. Its mandate would also include technology development, a skilled workforce, an extended producer responsibility framework, and a financing mechanism. Furthermore, the Minister during her speech, proposed to fully exempt customs duties on 25 critical minerals and reduce basic custom duties on two of the minerals. Both announcements entail significant implications.



Firstly, establishing a Critical Mineral Mission reflects national objectives of not only securing resilient domestic supply chains to mitigate strategic vulnerabilities presented by geopolitical uncertainties, supply chain disruptions, and import dependence on China, but also leveraging foreign reserves, technology, and capital through trusted bilateral and multilateral partnerships. Secondly, the statement is also emblematic of the official desire to foster technological advancement across the critical mineral value chains. Thirdly, the plan to exempt custom duties, besides securing the resources to strategic sectors in a cost-effective manner, is also likely to nudge India’s pace towards a clean energy transition, including the manufacturing of electric vehicles (EV). Lastly, exemption on duties would also enhance global competitiveness across a range of sectors in which the critical minerals are used for manufacturing vital components.

Addressing the Infirmities in the Supply Chains

India’s objective to develop entire value chains for the resources faces multipronged challenges. While the last four fiscal years have seen Union allocations to the Ministry of Mines, overseeing these critical assets rise, the disbursement for capital expenditure has been on a declining trend. Limited fiscal room for capital expenditure is worrying and antithetical to the budget and Critical Mineral Strategy’s focus on boosting domestic production, recycling, and innovation financing. Increasing industrial demands for resources, and the lack of extraction, processing and recycling technology and facilities warrant a significant increase in the Centre’s allocation for capital expenditure. Given the ever-increasing long-term criticality of the minerals, it does not seem to be ideal to be primarily dependent on private or foreign direct investment.

While critical minerals are found in large volumes across the globe, extracting and refining them is not only technologically intensive but also costly. Failing to receive the required number of minimum bidders, the Ministry of Mines recently scrapped the auction of lithium blocks for the second time in five months. The lacklustre response from the investors draws from India’s outdated resource classification rules, lacking adequate information regarding the economic viability of mining a block. Information on economically viable reserves with high geological confidence remains an imperative for mining firms, given the expensive extraction process.

Unlike exploration and manufacturing, the midstream activities i.e., processing and refining, which is the most important part of critical mineral value chains have not attracted requisite attention from the government, including through recent amendment to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. Consequently, the metal refining infrastructure such as vapor metallurgy needs to be amongst the official priorities to sustainably refine these minerals, without which an indigenous reliable ecosystem for minerals would remain elusive. Attaining capabilities to sustainably transform primary and secondary sources to intermediate materials calls for investment, especially in R&D to support research beyond the current laboratory-scale studies.

Subsequent to processing and refining, manufacturing and recycling part of the value chains also merit serious discussions among the policymakers. As technology evolves, India’s economy in future will be further underpinned by technologies that depend on minerals such as lithium, graphite, cobalt, titanium, and rare earth elements. For instance, the critical minerals input required in the manufacturing of an EV is six times that of a traditional car. Already, seven of the total thirteen sectors in the Production-Linked Incentives (PLI) scheme involve these critical assets in manufacturing vital components, such as solar PV modules and auto components. Besides, there are only seven recycling plants in India that can extract reusable materials from used batteries, which is particularly concerning given very limited domestic reserves. India’s burgeoning industrial needs, abundant e-waste and restricted mineral reserves signal the need for investment in cost-effective manufacturing and recycling plants. Amidst price volatility, surging global demand for clean energy technologies, and acute supply and geopolitical risks for minerals, including those considered critical by India, boosting recycling capabilities remains not only an environment-friendly option but also key to secure and cost-effective supply. India’s trajectory towards clean energy goals is expected to generate EV market growth at a CAGR of 49% till 2030. Thus, investing in recycling facilities that can extract and refurbish lithium-ion batteries also necessitates the government’s imminent consideration.

Recycling of critical minerals is expected to upscale going forward since one of the mandates of the Critical Mineral Mission as prescribed by the Union budget is the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework. The rules based on the concept of EPR and relevant to critical minerals are E-Waste Management Rules, 2022 and Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022. While these rules are expected to bring new technologies and investment in the recycling and refurbishment industry, both are riddled with inherent flaws.

In May 2023, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) made representation to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) asking for a one-year deferral of EPR obligations to private telecom operators. The telecom body wrote to the Ministry as the industry was not consulted regarding the average life-cycle of telecom and broadcasting equipment. The end-of-life disposal timeframe imposed under the EPR rules could increase compliance costs and capital expenditure, potentially affecting the network, since the obligations enforced are not in sync with real-world life cycles of products. Also, the weighty targets imposed which make it difficult to absorb the compliance costs as often argued by smaller businesses, merits a reappraisal. The e-waste rules also involve a stark omission. The provision for levying “environmental compensation” to producers, manufacturers, refurbishers, and recyclers for violating norms, does not contain a specified quantum of penalty. Similarly, Battery Waste Management Regulations are also not clear on the penalty imposed for violation of EPR targets and obligations. The rules for battery management also lack a directive on the funds that producers should pay to recyclers for obtaining EPR certificates or fulfilling obligations. This ambiguity can potentially affect the sum paid for waste collection and refurbishing to recyclers. It’s clear that both the rules have their respective loopholes and discrepancies which need to be resolved first, for streamlined implementation of the EPR framework.

Another line of decree entrusted in the Critical Mineral Mission is the skilling of the workforce. Having a skilled workforce and expertise across the value chains is equally salient, which would primarily require leveraging the technical expertise of Western partners like the US, and Australia through knowledge sharing and joint research arrangements. Considering India is the only developing nation in the US-led Mineral Security Partnership (MSP), it would do well to play its cards right and actualise objectives of becoming self-reliant in supply chains by collaborating in capacity-building initiatives in both upstream and midstream activities. While joint ventures in mining, processing, and R&D efforts in sustainable mining technology and extraction practices remain significant, it would serve India well to give partnership with Global South equal weightage. Collaborating with developing countries rich in mineral reserves like Argentina, Brazil and Chile is equally important in avoiding supply chain disruptions. The partnership with Latin American states cannot be merely mineral acquisition or joint exploration but also involve quid pro quo entailing Indian investments in sustainable extraction and processing infrastructure, which they lack.

Therefore, it’s clear that while the Union Budget 2024-25 strikes the right chord vis-à-vis critical minerals, the real challenge lies in implementation. India’s quest for reliable, diversified, and sustainable supply chains for critical minerals is set to be of paramount importance whilst it continues to balance environmental sustainability and developmental growth. Consequently, in the short term, the relevant waste management rules and official reporting standards need to be amended to shun ambiguities and make them attuned to the ground realities of the industry. Whereas, in the longer run, besides collaborating with like-minded and technologically advanced countries, India’s pursuit to become self-reliant across the value chains needs a significant upscale in capital expenditure, including in R&D.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024 – Buy-back tax: The debate continues,"– By Prashant Kapoor and Milan Khanna

Ms. Nirmala Sitaraman, Honorable Finance Minister of India, tabled the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024. The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes to overhaul buy-back taxation regime by bringing in significant amendments to the buy-back tax provisions.

What is Buy-back? – Buy-back of shares means purchase of its own shares by the company from the existing shareholders at a price decided by the Board thereby reducing the number of outstanding shares.



Recently, the corporate world has witnessed a surge in buy-back of shares by cash rich companies including multiple large cap companies that preferred buy-back of shares over conventional distribution of dividend to incentivize shareholders. FY2023-24 recorded the highest spent on buy-back in last 5 years, recording a staggering aggregate distribution of ~INR 51 billion by 41 companies (source: Buy-back offers yearly database by Prime Database, a database focusing on capital market offerings).

At present, buy-back tax @ 23.3% is to be paid by the company on the distributed income. Distributed income means the consideration paid by the company on buy-back of shares as reduced by the amount which was received on issue of such shares (determined in the manner prescribed). Further, the income arising to the shareholders in respect of such buy-back is exempt and not subject to additional tax.

In order to bring parity between tax implications on distribution of dividend (that shifts the burden of tax on the recipient shareholders) and the buy-back, the Finance Bill proposes to tax:

The entire amount received on buy-back of shares as dividend in the hands of shareholders as per their respective tax slabs. The Finance Bill has amended the definition of ‘dividend’ to provide that the amount received from the company towards buy-back will obtain the characteristics of dividend since the expression used is ‘any payment’ vis-à-vis ‘any distribution’ as stated in the other clause for dividend definition. Accordingly, the gross amount would be taxable for shareholders and withholding obligations would be casted on the company undertaking buy-back of shares as similar in the case of dividend.

The cost of acquisition of shares tendered in the buy-back will be considered as a capital loss in the hands of shareholders, which will be eligible for set-off against other capital gains or carry forward for a period of 8 years.

The new tax provisions will be effective from October 1, 2024. The amendment in buy-back taxation proposed in the Union Budget 2024 mark a significant shift in the regulatory landscape governing corporate share buy-backs and is poised to reshape the dynamics of capital distribution and investment strategies for companies as well as investors.

With the applicability of dividend taxation on buy-back, investors may witness a reduced overall return on investment as they would end up paying higher taxes on the entire buy-back amount and not on the real gains (i.e., amount received on buy-back less the amount invested). The increased tax liability will make the investments less attractive for investors.



The cost of acquisition for the bought-back shares shall be available as capital losses to the investors which shall be adjusted against capital gains.

While the investors would be able to carry forward this capital loss for a period of 8 years, they would not derive any benefit until sufficient capital gains are generated to utilize such losses.

The Union Budget, 2024 should have provided for an upfront cost base deduction to the shareholders rather than shifting this to a future capital gains event.

Interestingly, the proposed amendment expands the scope of deemed dividend. Under all exiting clauses, deemed dividend applies only if the company has accumulated profits (whether capitalized or not ). However, the proposed amendment contradicts from the very genesis of these provisions i.e., the deemed dividend under these provisions will apply irrespective of whether the company undertaking a buyback has profits or not.

In nutshell, the Government has plugged the loophole, narrowing down the tax arbitrage between distributing accumulated reserves through dividend and through buy-back of shares. The proposed buy-back taxation framework necessitates companies to comply with the updated tax provisions and reporting requirements and may have a negative impact on capital markets. Companies engaging in buy-back will need to carefully assess the tax implications and ensure accurate tax withholdings at the time of buy-back.

financialexpress.com,Assessing the Union Budget 2024-25 implications for real estate,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget for FY2024-25 outlines an ambitious plan to transform India into a developed nation under the vision of “Viksit Bharat.” This budget places a strong emphasis on urban and infrastructure development, human capital enhancement, manufacturing growth, MSMEs, and driving consumption, identifying nine priority areas for sustained efforts: agriculture productivity and resilience, employment and skilling, inclusive human resource development and social justice, manufacturing and services, urban development, energy security, infrastructure, innovation and R&D, and next-generation reforms.

Not dissimilar in approach to her first budget, which was also presented after the previous Lok Sabha win, this budget largely aims for longer term goals, with a sprinkling of near-term objectives. The focus this time, however, is on a wider range of items, including agriculture, MSMEs, manufacturing, urban and infrastructure development, the start-up economy, and much more.

Urban and infrastructure development take center stage in this budget, with manufacturing and housing positioned as primary beneficiaries. The ‘Cities as Growth Hubs’ initiative aims to rejuvenate urban areas under strain. Key measures include Transit Oriented Development for 14 large cities and a framework for creative brownfield redevelopment.





A significant allocation of INR 15,000 crore for the development of Andhra Pradesh’s capital city underscores the government’s commitment to urban infrastructure. This financial support is expected to catalyze significant real estate development in the region, enhancing market confidence and encouraging investment. Additionally, the budget’s emphasis on manufacturing, through the extension of the Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs, the establishment of industrial parks and corridors, and e-commerce export hubs, is poised to boost the country’s economic performance, with the warehousing real estate segment standing to benefit significantly from these initiatives.

The budget also addresses urban and rural development through measures such as interest subsidies for rental housing, PPP models for rental housing for industrial workers, and the addition of 3 crore housing units under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). These initiatives are designed to tackle the housing shortage and improve living standards in both urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the government’s decision to increase the standard deduction and lower tax slabs in the new tax regime for personal income tax is likely to increase disposable incomes among the middle-income group, thereby boosting demand in the affordable and mid-income housing segments.

The single most spoken of point from real estate perspective is that of long-term capital gains (LTGC) tax, coupled with the removal of indexation benefits. While this sounds like an onerous burden at first, deeper analysis reveals a different picture. A full-scale analysis is out of scope for this essay here; but it is clear that properties held over long time frames that have benefitted from strong price upswings of 7-8 times attract lesser LTCG under the new LTGC of 12.5% (14.95% effective tax) without indexation, than the previous 20% LTGC with indexation. This could have far-reaching implications, especially in curbing over-zealous investor activity, as against end-use purchases.

Moreover, the budget’s capex-led growth strategy, with an outlay of 3.4% of GDP amounting to INR 11.1 lakh crore, demonstrates fiscal prudence with a planned reduction in the fiscal deficit to 4.9% of GDP. This robust financial planning, along with strategic urban development policies, is set to create new urban clusters and spur real estate development across the country.

While the direct-tax part perhaps left a bit to be desired, it needs to be remembered that the finance minister has to present another full budget in about 6-7 months. The present budget lays a solid foundation for sustained economic growth, with urbanisation, manufacturing, infrastructure, and of course real estate sector being beneficiaries at this point. Agriculture and MSMEs were big focus areas too, and as elections loom in several states, it was just about a reasonable attempt to cover various crucial sectors for an effective 6-7 month period.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: New capital gains taxation rules offer fresh opportunities for HNI investors – Here’s how,"The recent Union Budget 2024 has introduced significant reforms in capital gains taxation, reshaping the investment landscape for High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs). I believe these changes warrant a thoughtful reassessment of investment strategies, although not necessarily a drastic overhaul. So, the question isn’t whether you should act – it’s how Thoughtfully portfolio allocations are made going forward to capitalize on these changes.

The new tax regime, already in force, has leveled the playing field across various asset classes. While this shift doesn’t call for knee-jerk reactions, it does present an opportune moment for HNIs to review their portfolios. The key is to evaluate how recent market rallies have impacted asset allocations and whether adjustments are needed to align with individual risk appetites and financial goals.

The revised long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax now provides a more favorable environment for overseas investments, subject to RBI limits for mutual funds. International funds, previously subject to debt taxation, now enjoy parity with Indian equities, albeit with a 24-month holding period for LTCG classification, down from 36 months earlier. This change opens new avenues for global diversification, a strategy that HNIs should seriously consider.





In the real estate sector, the tax reforms have brought about a positive shift, aligning it with equity for taxation purposes. This simplification is particularly beneficial for new real estate buyers. However, the impact of losing indexation benefits will be felt by those holding historical properties, especially those acquired before 2001 or properties where appreciation hasn’t outpaced inflation. These owners might face slightly higher capital gains taxes. While housing demand remains strong, we might see a reduction in speculative investments in urban areas, with investors potentially exiting properties that don’t appreciate rapidly enough. This segment could potentially redirect their allocations to financial markets. Overall, we’re observing a growing trend among investors towards understanding and appreciating the unique advantages of equity investing.

When it comes to unlisted shares, the tax harmonisation strategy now aligns rates with those of listed shares. This creates an intriguing opportunity for HNIs to explore the unlisted equity market. Other investment options that have become more attractive include overseas funds, gold funds, REITs/INVITs, and Equity Fund of Funds, all now taxed at 12.5% for LTCG. Foreign equity/debt, unlisted equity, and physical gold, if held for 24 months, also fall under this tax bracket. This clarity in tax structure allows investors to choose instruments that best suit their risk appetite and holding horizon.

It’s also worth noting that the marginal increase in capital gains tax on listed equities is unlikely to dampen investor sentiment significantly. The domestic inflow story remains strong, underpinned by the robust growth prospects of the Indian economy and equity markets.

While the Budget 2024 tax reforms have indeed reshaped the investment terrain, they also present new opportunities for astute investors. HNIs should view this as a chance to optimise their portfolios, diversifying across both domestic and international markets, and exploring asset classes that now offer more favorable tax treatment. The key lies in making informed decisions based on an understanding of these changes, aligning investments with long-term financial goals, and maintaining a balanced approach to risk and return.

financialexpress.com,How Budget 2024 proposals will ease the cashflow for salaried taxpayers,"By Divya Baweja

July 23 marked a significant milestone as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, the first Budget of the government’s third term. Amidst expectations of economic revival and relief for various sectors, the Budget outlined a comprehensive strategy aimed at fostering inclusive growth and boosting the economy.

One of the highlights of this year’s Budget is the proposed modification of the tax slabs under the new regime, which has been a focus area of the government. In the new tax regime, the income tax rates are set to undergo the following changes:



Moreover, the standard deduction for salaried employees is proposed to increase from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000, providing further relief to taxpayers. These revisions are expected to provide tax savings up to Rs 17,500 for a salaried taxpayer under the new regime.

The Budget further proposes an increase in deduction related to family pension for pensioners opting for the New Tax Regime, raising it from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000. This is aimed at improving the financial well-being of pensioners and providing them with greater disposable incomes.



Further, in a bid to enhance social security benefits, the Budget proposes an increase in the deduction of employer’s contribution towards the National Pension System (NPS) from 10% to 14% of the employee’s salary for those opting for the new tax regime. This move is expected to encourage more taxpayers to opt for the new tax regime.

The Budget also aims to rationalize the taxation of capital gains, proposing a simplified structure. The holding period has been limited to two periods only – 12 months and 24 months – to determine if an asset is a long-term or a short-term capital asset.

Further, long-term gains on all financial and non-financial assets will now attract a uniform tax rate of 12.5%. Hence, the tax rate for long-term capital gains on STT paid listed securities and units of equity-oriented funds has increased from 10% to 12.5%, above Rs 125,000 (as against Rs 100,000 under the current provisions); however, the tax rate for long term capital gains on all other assets has been reduced from 20% to 12.5%. Moreover, the benefit of indexation, which was earlier available on long term capital assets, has been proposed to be abolished.

While for listed bonds and debentures, the rate shall be reduced to 12.5%, capital gains on unlisted debentures and unlisted bonds shall still be taxed at applicable slab rates, irrespective of whether it is a short-term or long-term gain.

Concurrently, short-term capital gains (STCG) on listed equity shares and units of equity-oriented mutual funds will see an increase in the tax rate from the existing 15% to 20%.

To ease the cashflow for salaried taxpayers, it has been proposed that the tax collected at source, or any other deduction of tax, be allowed while arriving at the remaining tax liability by employers. This is a welcome move which shall result in reducing the claims for refund while filing the tax return.

Similarly, positive changes have been proposed in the Budget to provide relief to taxpayers under the Black Money Law and in reducing the time for issuing notices for reassessment.

The above changes made by the Hon’ble FM aim to make the new tax regime more attractive, which is in line with the thinking of the government. On the contrary, the increase in the capital gains rate for STT paid listed securities and units of equity-oriented funds may dampen the spirit of investors.

Overall, the Budget seems to be moving in the direction of simplifying the tax laws, to make life easer for the taxpayers.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Pathway to a Viksit Bharat,"– By Suman Chowdhury

The Union Budget of July 2024 outlines not just short term fiscal measures but also a strategic roadmap for economic and fiscal policies over the next five years. With a focus on fiscal consolidation, rationalization of taxation structure and a reboot of the manufacturing sector, the budget also prioritizes long-term goals like employment generation through incentives and skilling initiatives, crucial steps towards the goal of Viksit Bharat.

Key Themes



Fiscal Consolidation

The budget reaffirms the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation, aiming for a fiscal deficit below 4.5% by FY26 after targeting a 4.9% figure in FY25 based on a realistic growth in tax revenues. From FY27, the focus will shift to a gradual reduction of the Central Government debt as a proportion of GDP. From a low of 3.4% in FY19, the fiscal deficit spiked to 9.2% in FY21 due to COVID-19, followed by a steady decline to 5.6% in FY24. The government improved on the last fiscal’s deficit target by 30 bps and now revised the current year target by 20 bps over the interim budget.

Employment Generation

Three new schemes will incentivize job creation for both new employees and employers, targeting the creation of over 2 Crore new jobs, which will positively impact private consumption over the medium term.

Manufacturing Ecosystem

The budget emphasizes the developing of a robust manufacturing sector, especially through MSMEs, to generate employment. Measures include:

– A separate guarantee fund for MSME loans up to Rs 100 Cr.

– Additional loans for stressed MSMEs.

– An expanded TReDS platform for better working capital funding.

Policies were announced to improve the manufacturing infrastructure through new industrial parks, rental housing for industrial workers, and the ship leasing industry, further supported by large outlays for skilling programs.

Infrastructure Development

With a capital expenditure allocation of Rs 11.1 tn, a 16% growth over the previous year, the government aims to accelerate infrastructure development, particularly boosting the order book of construction companies post general elections. Special focus is on infrastructural development in Bihar and AP, and tourism infrastructure in several states.

Agricultural Transformation

Policy measures to enhance crop diversity, mitigate climate risks, and moderate food inflation include initiatives for self-reliance in pulses and oilseeds and developing urban-centred vegetable production clusters. Establishing a digital land registry backbone is a pivotal reform for the agricultural sector.

Sustainability and Energy

While the budget falls short on some sustainability fronts such as EVs, it includes measures to support indigenous manufacture of batteries and solar cells by reducing customs duties on essential components. Policies to diversify alternative energy sources, such as pumped hydro projects and small modular nuclear reactors, aim to enhance the renewable energy mix in the grid, essential for achieving the 2030 SDGs.

Tax Reforms

Adjustments in tax slabs under the new regime and a moderate increase in the standard deduction will reduce tax payouts for mid-income salaried employees, potentially boosting consumption and encouraging transition to the simpler tax regime. However, higher tax payouts on capital gains will impact those with significant equity market incomes.

Overall, the 2024 budget is structured to support long-term economic growth through strategic thrust on infrastructure, manufacturing, and employment generation, aligning with the broader vision of a Viksit Bharat.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: A blueprint for sustainable growth and development,"By Pooja Misra

“Tripartite compact” a term given in the Economic Survey has resonated pretty strongly with many of us. The survey states that for the country to be a Viksit Bharat by 2047, a tripartite compact is needed between the Centre, State and Private industry be it in terms of land and labour reforms and/or between the Government, Private Sector and Academia for skill development and job creation.

The Indian economy has remained robust, demonstrated resilience in the face of geopolitical challenges and achieved a GDP growth of 8.2% in the previous financial year, but for India to be a Viksit Bharat by 2047 and move towards equitable growth and away from a K-shaped growth there are certain key challenges that the country needs to address. While we have suitably grown from a low-income economy to a low-middle-income nation with our GDP per capita being in the range of $2730.77 approx. as against that of China being $13,136.48 and US and UK being 85,372.69 and $51,074.79 respectively, to be a Viksit Bharat by 2047 we need to focus on addressing these challenges and not get caught in ‘the middle-income trap’.



What does the Employment Data show:

To begin with, the one challenge that has been on the forefront for quite some time now is unemployment. The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) – Quarterly Bulletin for January – March 2024 showed that the unemployment rate in urban areas in India stood at 6.7% as against a global unemployment rate of 5.1% (World Bank, 2023). As per RBI KLEMS data, all-India unemployment rate (UR) had declined to a 20-month low of 7% (May 2024), however, the Economic survey itself acknowledges that, to cater to the rising workforce the Indian economy needs to generate an average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs annually until 2030 in the non-farm sector.

The numbers for Labour Force Participation rate (LFPR) and Female Labour Force Participation (FLFPR) in urban areas in India show that it has increased to 50.2% and 25.6% respectively in January – March 2024, yet when we compare the LFPR to World Bank data it shows that at a global level the LFPR was at 66.3% in 2022 and FLFPR stood at 49% in 2023, thus highlighting the fact that the country still has some way to go. Yes, the Government has done well in designing of the three Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) schemes which should give the much-needed boost to increased LFPR, employment and private investment. Interestingly, this would also lead to the formalisation of labour and to a certain extent address the issue of private investment not taking off and work favorably for the economy.

Increased Private Capex – need of the hour

As stated in the Economic Survey it is high time that private investment cycle takes off and does the heavy lifting. An increase in private capital expenditure, will lead to companies expanding operations, investing in new technologies and creation of jobs. With the Government focusing on and calling for ‘all hands on deck’, laying stress on a ‘tripartite compact’, an investment-led growth should create jobs, enhance productivity, build long-term economic capacity and lay the foundation for sustainable long-term growth for the nation. With capacity utilization numbers of India Inc. being in the region of 74%-80%, the logical next step is increased private capital expenditure.



While sectors such as steel, cement, construction, real estate have been showing increased private capex, however we know that it is not broad based and as given in the Economic Survey private gross fixed capital formation in machinery & equipment and intellectual property is yet to take off. The ELI for manufacturing could give the much-needed push. The silver lining on the wall being that in addition to incentivising for private investment to increase in the Union Budget 2024-25, there is continuity being maintained in the govt. capex with an allocation of 11.11 lakh crore. Increased government capex results in boosting growth, gives rise to employment opportunities for the skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled persons and has a multiplier impact on the core sectors of the economy.

Time and cost overruns for Government Projects need to be monitored:

However, in reference to the government capital expenditure what is much needed is that there should be close monitoring of projects in relation to time and cost overrun. Just to quote latest data, the Indian government’s cost overruns in central government projects reached a 12-month high of 20.09% in April 2024, with 1,838 projects with a value of Rs 150 crore and above costing Rs 33.2 lakh crore, while the time overrun has dipped from 36.04 months in March to 35.4 months in April with 48% of projects delayed for over two years.

MSMEs: A Key Integral Constituent of the Economy

The plus point in the budget being that the Government has done well by providing the boost to the MSME sector through credit guarantee scheme etc. The highlight being e-commerce export hubs to be set-up to enable MSMEs and traditional artisans to market their produce in international markets which should logically give a boost to the One District, One Product scheme and help in balanced regional development.

Another positive from the budget is that with a reduction in the fiscal deficit target to 4.9% of GDP for this FY (moving fast on the glide path), the crowding out effect due to government borrowings will be lowered and leave ample space in the financial flow and availability of funds for the private sector and will also give added advantage to the small and medium sector.

Land and Labour reforms needed for Viksit Bharat 2047:

Also to add, while the Government has been moving in the right direction with its China + 1 policy, PLI schemes etc, however, for the same to fructify, with ease of doing business as its central focus, next-generation structural and economic reforms are much needed not only to be devised, but also implemented and executed especially in the context of land and labour policies. Reforms in the land acquisition policy is a key area that the government needs to address and address fast. Agreeably, digitisation of land records, creating digitised cadastral maps are key steps which can ensure effective implementation of land acquisition policy but we need to move faster on the land acquisition reform so that it becomes an enabler and does not remain a deterrent for industry. Similar is the case with the labor reforms. Here is where the tripartite compact between the Centre, States and private sector needs to move into action.

Effective implementation of Training and Skill Development Programmes:

Training and skill development programs aligning with industry needs have been the call of the day for quite some time now. While, 1,000 Industrial Training Institutes to be upgraded in hub and spoke arrangements with outcome orientation, 20 lakh youth to be skilled over a 5-year period and course content & design aligned as per skill needs of industry are all steps in the right direction and has good intent behind it but, what needs to be seen and closely monitored is its execution on the ground. Skills that make individuals more employable and adaptable to changing job requirements and consequently bring down structural unemployment need to be identified and worked upon by the academia hand in hand with the industry. Equal onus for re-designing of course curriculum lies with the academia and industry. Yes, the announcement that one crore youth would receive internship opportunities in the top 500 companies will prove to be a significant investment in skill development programs and provide a solid foundation for a workforce prepared for the future, but if we want to be a Viksit Bharat by 2047, this is an area in which the Government, academicians and industry need to come together and work.

Quality Employment will build a Viksit Bharat

To be a Viksit Bharat by 2047, not only job creation but, quality employment is what we would need and the same can be an outcome of research and development, increased domestic manufacturing wherein skilled labour is employed, expansion of exports especially in areas catering to labour-intensive manufacturing and signing of more free trade agreements. Rather, it might be a good idea that that when FTAs are signed the details of the same should be percolated down to the MSMEs especially the ones engaged in exports as that would help them strategise their production plan accordingly and reap higher returns.

Urban Development a key focal point

Not to miss, with 68% of the world population projected to live in urban areas by 2050 (United Nations, 2018) and with India, China and Nigeria expected to be accounting for as high as 35% of the projected growth of the global population between 2018 and 2050, investing in building of sustainable urban infrastructure is a head that cannot be ignored and the Government has done well by stating that ‘Cities are the growth hubs’ and ‘Creative redevelopment of cities’ and ‘Transit Oriented Development plans for 14 large cities with a population above 30 lakh is much needed’. Strategically designed sustainable infrastructure facilitates long term sustainable urban expansion, while minimising resource depletion and mitigating environmental damage.

All growth engines needed to fire

Last but most importantly, it has been a much-discussed fact time and again, that the nation needs to fire on all its growth engines especially Private Final Consumption expenditure. While increased employment should give the much-needed boost to private consumption this will bear fruits only in the medium term. Increasing money in the hands of people to spend especially the middle and lower income strata of society could be a solution worth exploring. Yes, while some comfort has been provided to individuals who opt for the new tax scheme, however, a more innovative approach, such as bringing petrol and diesel under the GST ambit, may give a significant boost to the economy in the short term too.

The Budget Session that started on July 22 and is scheduled to conclude on August 12. While there was nothing special in the Union Budget for the middle-class, however some assistance was provided to the farmers. On Tuesday, while delivering her budget speech, Sitharaman offered financial aid as well as irrigation and rehabilitation projects for states hit by flood including Bihar, Assam, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.

Let’s have a look at why these states have been given special flood relief aid in Budget 2024:

Bihar

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her speech said that Rs 11,500 crore would be allocated for flood control efforts in Bihar. Floods have often befallen the state, with many of them coming from outside the nation. She further added that there are currently no plans in place to construct flood control structures in Nepal.



The FM stated that projects with an estimated cost of Rs 11,500 crore will receive financial support from our government under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme and other sources. In addition to this, she said that a survey and inquiry into flood control and irrigation projects relating to Kosi will be conducted.

Assam

Due to the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries originating outside of India, Assam experiences floods every year. During the budget speech, Sitharaman stated that assistance to Assam for flood management and related projects will be provided.

Sikkim

In her Budget 2024 announcement, FM Sitharaman expressed her desire to aid in the state’s reconstruction following the catastrophic Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). Devastating landslides and flash floods have struck Sikkim, causing havoc throughout the state.

Uttarakhand

Funds to support the state will be provided as announced during the presentation of the Union Budget speech due to massive landslides and cloudbursts causing losses in the state.

Himachal Pradesh

Floods last year caused significant damages in Himachal Pradesh. The finance minister said, “Our government will provide assistance to the state for reconstruction and rehabilitation through multilateral development assistance.”",Center,Center- Right,https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/budget-2024-bihar-to-assam-these-flood-prone-states-get-key-aid-programme-know-details-of-nirmala-sitharamans-announcement/3565009/
financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024-25: A roadmap for inclusive growth,"By Pawan Munjal

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi embarks on his third consecutive term, he reaffirms his commitment to continuity and stability. The inaugural Union Budget of the Modi 3.0 government, presented by our finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, epitomises this promise. This Budget reinforces India’s ambitious journey towards becoming Viksit Bharat—a developed nation.

In this Amrit Kaal, India stands on a strong and robust economic growth trajectory, with a projected GDP growth of ~6.5-7% for the current fiscal year. Despite global economic adversities, India has successfully shielded itself from adverse impacts. Budget 2024 is meticulously designed to address key areas crucial for propelling India to the next echelon of growth.



To advance India’s growth, Budget 2024 focuses on crucial areas: women-led development, advanced skilling, job creation, rural empowerment, energy sector transformation, and ease of doing business. This Budget not only addresses these pivotal areas but also establishes a solid foundation to sustain the government’s growth trajectory for the next five years. Such strategic alignment ensures a comprehensive and inclusive framework, positioning India for continued ascendancy on the global stage.





India’s youthful demographic provides a significant advantage in addressing the global skill gap. The employment-linked incentive scheme, initiated by the finance minister, is a decisive step in this direction, aiming to benefit 20 lakh youth over the next five years. Additionally, upgrading 1,000 industrial training institutes will catalyse the creation of skilled workforce, aligning with the industry demands.

Prime Minister Modi’s unwavering belief in the power of nari shakti (women power) is evident in Budget 2024’s emphasis on enhancing women’s participation in the workforce. The announcement of establishing hostels and forming partnerships to conduct women-specific skilling programmes is not only praiseworthy, but also underscores the government’s commitment to all-encompassing, inclusive development.

India’s commitment to green energy has reached a pivotal juncture. The Budget extends its energy security initiatives by introducing a policy document on energy transition pathways that harmonises employment, growth, and environmental sustainability imperatives.

The government’s commitment to bolstering rural development is evident in the substantial budget allocation for capital expenditure, aimed at strengthening infrastructure and enhancing connectivity in rural areas. These connectivity projects will facilitate greater accessibility and mobility within rural communities, fostering inclusive growth.

The announcement of releasing 109 high-yielding, resilient, and climate-adaptive varieties of 32 field and horticultural crops coupled with the plan to initiate one crore farmers into natural farming holds the potential to boost agricultural sector growth, advancing India’s journey towards becoming aatmanirbhar (self-reliant).

Recognising micro, small and medium Enterprises (MSMEs) as the backbone of our nation, it is encouraging to see an increase in the Mudra loan limit from `10 lakh to `20 lakh. This move will ensure enhanced capital availability, drive innovation, and spur employment generation opportunities.

Budget 2024 reflects India’s steadfast commitment to inclusive and sustainable growth. By prioritising advanced skilling, robust employment initiatives, green energy transformation, and comprehensive support to MSMEs, this Budget lays the foundation for a resilient and innovative future. These decisive measures will not only address current challenges, but also create employment opportunities, driving the nation towards unparalleled prosperity. With this visionary blueprint, India is set to emerge stronger, more self-reliant, and ready to lead on the global stage.

Chadha remarked that the BJP’s failure to secure a majority in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, with only 240 seats, was a result of the public imposing an “18% GST” on the government.

Participating in the budget debate, Chadha said, “In 2019, the BJP had 303 seats in Lok Sabha, but in 2024, the public imposed 18% GST and gave them only 240 seats. The main reasons for their plight are economic failures.” He illustrated this by explaining the tax burden on a common man: “If a person earns Rs 10, they pay Rs 3 in income tax, Rs 2-2.50 in GST, Rs 2 in capital gains tax, and Rs 1-1.50 in other charges, leaving them with only Rs 2-3. Despite this heavy taxation, what does the common man gain? We pay taxes like England but get services like Somalia.”



Chadha further alleged that the Budget 2024 has managed to displease all sections of society. He quipped, “Typically, some sections are pleased and others are disappointed with the budget. This time, the government has disappointed everyone, including BJP supporters. Over the last 10 years, they have burdened citizens with heavy taxes.”

In his speech, Chadha offered an analysis of why the BJP lost seats in the elections and provided suggestions to the government. He emphasised that economic issues, particularly rural income and inflation, food inflation and unemployment, were the primary reasons for the BJP’s defeat.

He highlighted that rural income growth is at a decadal low, food inflation is around 9% and unemployment rates are alarmingly high in both organised and unorganised sectors.

Chadha concluded by stressing the need for better economic management, urging the government to address these critical issues.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: How removal of indexation benefits impacts property tax – Comparison of pre-2001 and post-2001 purchases,"In the Union Budget 2024, the removal of the indexation benefit on property transactions has led to significant changes in the calculation of long-term capital gains (LTCG). However, the government has clarified that the indexation benefit will remain available for properties bought or inherited before 2001, even though the LTCG tax rate has been reduced from 20% to 12.5%.

As the government has clarified that properties bought before 2001 will still get indexation benefits on sale, here is an illustration taking two scenarios – pre-2001 purchase and post-2001 property purchase.





Scenario 1: Property Bought in 1999

For property bought before 2001, the indexation benefit is available, as per new changes in the LTCG structure.

Calculation of Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) with Indexation

Let’s assume the Cost Inflation Index (CII) for the year of sale (2024) is 348 and for the year 1999 is 100.

Indexed cost of acquisition = Purchase value * (CII for 2024 / CII for 1999)

Indexed cost of acquisition = ₹10,00,000 * (348 / 100) = ₹34,80,000

LTCG Calculation:

LTCG = Current property value – Indexed cost of acquisition

LTCG = ₹1,00,00,000 – ₹34,80,000 = ₹65,20,000

Tax Calculation:

Tax rate = 12.5%

Tax = 12.5% of ₹65,20,000 = ₹8,15,000

Long-Term Capital Gains Tax payable: ₹8,15,000

Scenario 2: Property Bought in 2003

Calculation of Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) without Indexation

For property bought after 2001, the indexation benefit is not available.

Cost of acquisition = ₹10,00,000

LTCG Calculation:

LTCG = Current property value – Cost of acquisition

LTCG = ₹1,00,00,000 – ₹10,00,000 = ₹90,00,000

Tax Calculation:

Tax rate = 12.5%

Tax = 12.5% of ₹90,00,000 = ₹11,25,000

Long-Term Capital Gains payable: ₹11,25,500

To summarise the both scenarios, the tax payable on the sale of a property bought in 1999, benefiting from indexation, is ₹8,15,000. The tax payable on the sale of a property bought in 2003, without indexation, is ₹11,25,000.

Justifying the indexation removal move, meanwhile, the Income Tax Department in one of the posts on social media handle ‘X’ said, “Nominal real estate returns are generally in the region of 12-16 per cent per annum, much higher than inflation. The indexation for inflation is in the region of 4-5 per cent, depending on the period of holding. Therefore, substantial tax savings are expected to a vast majority of such tax payers.”",Center,Center,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/budget-2024-how-removal-of-indexation-benefits-impacts-property-tax-comparison-of-pre-2001-and-post-2001-purchases-3564909/
financialexpress.com,What is indexation in property sale and how is it calculated? What has changed after Budget 2024?,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in Budget 2024, announced the scrapping of indexation benefits on property sales, prompting real estate experts to call the move “negative” for the sector from an investment perspective. However, the government has attempted to offset this by lowering the long-term capital gains tax to 12.5% on the sale of property and other financial and non-financial assets. Before moving further, let’s understand what indexation is and how it is calculated on the sale of various assets, including real estate assets held over a certain period.

In case of property sale, indexation helps in adjusting its purchase price according to the prevailing inflation rate. So basically the adjustment inflates the purchase price of a property considering the inflation over the invested years, which ultimately brings down the taxable capital gains on the sale of the property. The government releases cost inflation index (CII) numbers to index capital gains on specified assets. CII number takes into account the prevailing inflation for the particular financial year.





Through indexation, investors can accurately determine their capital gains and be assured that they are paying taxes only on the real gains after inflation is adjusted.

How is Indexation Calculated?

Let’s break down an example to see how indexation worked under the previous tax rules:

Purchase Price of Property: ₹50 lakh

Adjusted Purchase Price (Indexed): ₹64.82 lakh

Sale Price (2024-25): ₹70 lakh

Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG): ₹5.18 lakh

LTCG Tax Liability: ₹1.036 lakh (20% of Gain)

Under New Tax Rules – No Indexation Allowed

Now, let’s see how the calculations look under the new tax rules, where indexation is not allowed:

Purchase Price of Property: ₹50 lakh

Sale Price (2024-25): ₹70 lakh

Gain: ₹20 lakh

LTCG Tax Liability: ₹2.5 lakh (12.5% of Gain)

Remember, the purchase price of the asset is adjusted by the cost inflation index (CII). This helps in accounting for inflation over the period of holding the asset.

Formula to calculate the adjusted purchase price using the cost inflation index is: Cost Inflation Index (CII) = Sales Amount – (Purchase Amount * (Index in year of sale / Index in year of purchase))

This adjustment ensures that the taxable gain reflects the real increase in the asset’s value, not just the effect of inflation.

Changes in the Union Budget 2024 regarding indexation benefits

In the Union Budget 2024, the Centre has lowered the tax rates on capital gains from the sale of long-held real estate properties but has scrapped the indexation benefit. The LTCG tax rate has been reduced from 20% with indexation to 12.5% without indexation on sale of property.

The indexation benefit, however, can be taken on the sale of property bought or inherited before 2001, which means if someone sells now an old property bought before 2001, he or she will have to pay an LTCG rate of 12.5% without this ‘inflation adjustment’ benefit.



Many experts see this removal of indexation for long-term capital gains (LTCG) on property deals in the Budget a significant blow to property owners selling their ancestral properties.

“The Budget move on change in taxation, effective from July 23, 2024, replaces the 20% LTCG rate with indexation to a flat 12.5% without indexation. This translates to a potentially higher tax burden, often amounting to lakhs of rupees, for those looking to sell older properties,” says KS Roy, a personal finance expert.

The removal of the indexation benefit could have three major consequences.

1. Slowdown in the resale market: It may discourage owners of older residential properties and land from selling, as the increased tax liability reduces their potential profit.

2. Rise in cash transactions: There’s a concern that this change could incentivize under-the-table cash deals to avoid the higher tax burden, counteracting efforts to formalize the real estate sector.

3. Higher property prices: Sellers may attempt to offset the increased tax burden by raising property prices, effectively transferring the cost to buyers.",Center,Center,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/what-is-indexation-in-property-sale-and-how-is-it-calculated-what-has-changed-after-budget-2024-3564188/

The government will launch Phase 4 of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana, which aims to provide all-weather roads to 25,000 rural habitats. This initiative is expected to enhance connectivity and support economic development in rural areas.

Addressing the challenges faced by various states due to flooding, Sitharaman, in her Union Budget 2024 speech, highlighted the government’s commitment to providing substantial financial support.

Uttarakhand, which has faced substantial damage from landslides and cloudbursts, will be granted the necessary aid to help with recovery and rebuilding efforts.

The total financial support for these initiatives is estimated to be Rs 11,500 crore, reflecting the government’s ongoing commitment to addressing infrastructure challenges and improving resilience against natural disasters.

The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana’s fourth phase will connect 50,000 habitations having population above 250 in plain areas and 100 in special category states with all- weather roads.

Following these phases, a new component, the Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas (RCPLWEA), was introduced in 2016 to focus on constructing rural roads in areas affected by left-wing extremism.

This will be her seventh consecutive budget and will surpass the record held by the late Moraji Desai, who presented six consecutive budgets.



The much awaited comprehensive budget for 2024–25, the first under the Modi 3.0 government, will be unveiled on the Parliament floor today at 11 a.m.

The finance minister’s big statements and the government’s prognostications regarding the state of the economy as a whole will be the focus of attention for everyone. The first significant economic document of the Modi 3.0 government would be the Union Budget 2024, which will likely lay the groundwork for the country’s transformation into ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, among other things. Sitharaman presented the pre-Budget Economic Survey to the Lok Sabha on Monday. It established a cautious growth estimate of 6.5 to 7 percent for the current fiscal year.



The Finance Minister also lay on the table, under subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, a copy each (in English and Hindi) of the following papers: medium-term fiscal policy strategy statement and macro-economic framework statement.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 sets the stage for a sustainable growth trajectory for real estate,"Covering a wide spectrum of Indian sectors, the first Union Budget of Modi 3.0 laid its focus on MSMEs, employment, skilling, youth, and the middle class. While the Budget sidestepped the long-standing demands of the real estate sector, the focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, boost to infrastructure, urban redevelopment and relaxation in income tax slabs are the big reforms that will indirectly provide a fillip to the real estate sector.

“The call to State Governments to reduce stamp duty and initiate land related reforms that includes urban planning, usage, building bylaws, and GIS mapping of land records are steps in the right direction that will not just help the sector but also be a strong growth propeller for the Indian economy,” said Samir Jasuja, Founder and CEO of PropEquity.

The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the PPP model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and Transit-Oriented Developments.



“The additional 3 crore housing units in rural and urban areas under PMAY is a welcome step for closing the gap in the sector. The decision to increase the standard deduction along with lowering the tax slabs in the new tax regime for personal income tax should lead to an increase in disposable incomes for the middle-income group. This will bode well for demand in affordable and mid-income housing. The changes in capital gains tax remain an area of concern, though,” said Anurag Mathur, CEO, Savills India.

Amit Goyal, Managing Director, India Sotheby’s International Realty, said, “The budget strikes a delicate balance: prioritizing infrastructure, job creation, and MSMEs while maintaining fiscal discipline. The commitment to reduce the deficit to 4.5% and below over the next few years by FM Nirmala Sitharaman, is commendable. This ensures long-term economic stability, high credit rating and FDI inflows for India. In a young nation with a large youth population (40% under 25!), skilling and job creation are crucial.”

For real estate transaction, bringing down the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5% is a welcome step, even if it comes with removal of indexation benefits. This will encourage more liquidity in property transactions. Higher uniformity in long term capital gains tax across different asset classes was a long standing ask of investors.

“The push for digitization, efficient land management, and modernized bylaws is also a boost for urbanisation and real estate. This will improve ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes,” he added.

Sunil Dewali, Co-CEO of Andromeda Sales & Distribution Pvt Ltd, parent company of Andromeda Realty Advisors, said, “The Finance Minister’s announcement to make housing more affordable, with a Rs 2.2 lakh crore push under the PM Awas Yojana-Urban, is a major step forward. Addressing the needs of one crore poor and middle-class families with a Rs 10 lakh crore investment over five years, it reflects a robust approach to urban development. Encouraging states to reduce high stamp duty rates, especially for women buyers, is progressive. Digitizing land records, GIS mapping, and urban housing initiatives, alongside workforce skilling, will boost the real estate sector. Significant infrastructure investments and simplified FDI rules will drive private investment, fostering economic growth and stability.”

Here we take a look at some of India’s leading developers’ budget reactions:

Jogendra Singh, CFO and Group President (Finance), Hero Realty Private Ltd: “The Finance minister has presented a long-term sustainable growth-oriented budget through focus on all drivers of the economy including agriculture, employment generation, skill development, urban development, energy, infra push, R&D and innovation push and creating an engine to steer ’Bharat’ into ‘Viksit Bharat’. The proposals on industry are welcome and growth-oriented, however on personal taxation, the changes may create a negative sentiment with changes in capital gains tax. Other tax proposals are on expected lines to reduce litigation, dispute and complexity. Decriminalization in certain defaults is a welcome step.”

Sanjeev Kumar Sharma, CFO, M3M India: “The Budget for 2024 shows a forward-thinking approach, tackling the changing requirements of India’s property market. The focus on building infrastructure and providing support for housing matches well with the changing desires of those looking to buy homes. There’s a clear pattern where people are becoming more open to spending more, choosing developments that include extra living areas and contemporary facilities. The Real Estate sector is focusing on aligning with the government’s initiatives and demonstrating a commitment to addressing the evolving needs of homebuyers. This budget creates a setting that supports steady expansion, allowing companies like M3M India to innovate and produce top-notch housing developments. We are hopeful for what’s to come and are ready to make a significant impact on the industry, in line with the government’s goals.”

Vivek Singhal, CEO, Smartworld Developers: “The 2024 Union Budget reaffirms the government’s commitment to urban development and housing, aligning perfectly with the real estate sector’s growth trajectory. The substantial allocation of Rs 11.11 lakh crore for infrastructure development, representing 3.4% of India’s GDP, is a significant boost that will have far-reaching positive impacts on our industry. The government’s encouragement for states to moderate stamp duty rates is a welcome move that could potentially stimulate property transactions. The consideration of further duty reductions for properties purchased by women is an innovative step towards promoting inclusivity in homeownership. These measures build upon the robust growth we witnessed in 2023, where housing sales in the top seven cities reached an all-time high of 4.77 lakh units. As we progress through 2024, we anticipate that these budget provisions, combined with the sector’s inherent strengths, will maintain this momentum. The budget’s focus on urban development and housing will undoubtedly enhance real estate’s appeal to both homebuyers and investors.”

Kunal Rishi, COO, Paras Buildtech: “In this landmark budget, the government has demonstrated a strong commitment to propelling India towards a ‘Viksit Bharat’. The measures announced, particularly the encouragement to states to moderate stamp duties and the consideration of reduced duties for properties purchased by women, are significant steps forward. These initiatives will not only make homeownership more accessible but will also stimulate urban development across the country. The allocation of Rs 11.11 lakh crore for capital expenditure is a clear indication of the government’s dedication to infrastructure development. This substantial investment will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the real estate sector, driving growth and enhancing urban living standards. Furthermore, the Rs 10 lakh crore investment under PM Awas Yojana Urban 2.0 to address the housing needs of the urban poor and middle class is a commendable initiative. This move will provide a much-needed boost to urban housing and ensure that more families have access to affordable and quality homes. Overall, this budget sets a robust foundation for sustainable growth in the real estate sector and reaffirms the government’s vision for a progressive and inclusive India.”

Ashish Sharma, AVP Operations, Brahma Group: “The Budget 2024 brings in great tax incentives and simpler regulations to boost investments in housing and infrastructure projects. Additionally, it aims to improve funding for developers and homebuyers, support housing initiatives, and promote sustainable urban development. Moreover, the proposed Rs 10 lakh crore investment sets the stage for a transformative era in the real estate sector, promising better connectivity and urban expansion. The budget’s emphasis on accessibility, affordability, and environmental sustainability shows its dedication to creating job opportunities and ensuring robust sectoral growth in the coming years.”

Ashish Agarwal, Director, AU Real Estate: “We wholeheartedly embrace the Union Budget 2024-25 unveiled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, particularly the ambitious allocation for infrastructure development. The proposed investment of Rs 10 lakh crore signals a transformative era for the real estate sector, paving the way for enhanced connectivity and urban expansion. By prioritizing ease of doing business and supporting job creation, this budget fosters an environment ripe for investment and innovation. We believe these strategic initiatives will not only meet the growing demand for housing but also stimulate economic growth, benefiting developers, buyers, and communities alike. Together, we can build a brighter future, turning vision into reality in the vibrant landscape of real estate.”

Aman Trehan, Executive Director, Trehan Iris: “The Union Budget 2024-25 has ignited a sense of optimism within the real estate fraternity. The substantial capital expenditure of Rs 10 lakh crore earmarked for infrastructure development is a testament to the government’s commitment to fostering a conducive environment for growth. As real estate developers, we are particularly enthused by the emphasis on ease of doing business and the incentives aimed at job creation. These measures will undoubtedly catalyze investment and spur innovation in the sector. Moreover, the focus on housing and urban development aligns perfectly with our vision of creating vibrant, livable communities. We are confident that this budget will serve as a catalyst for the real estate industry, propelling it towards new heights of success and sustainability.”

Santosh Agarwal, CFO and Executive Director of Alphacorp: “We applaud the government for its forward-thinking budget proposals, which hold significant promise for the real estate sector. The emphasis on ‘Viksit Bharat’ as a theme for this year is particularly commendable as it aims to bridge the urban-rural divide and ensure inclusive development across regions. Lower stamp duties aim to make property more affordable for women, boosting home ownership and stimulating real estate transactions. This reduction in costs is expected to encourage more women and families to take benefit of the savings. Furthermore, investment-ready ‘plug and play’ industrial parks will be developed in or near 100 cities, with 12 parks already sanctioned under the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme. These initiatives are poised to bolster industrial growth, attract investments, and boost local economies across the nation.”

LC Mittal, Director, Motia Group: “Bringing investment in urban housing to ₹10 lakh crore under PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 is a quantum jump seen in the nation’s response towards its urban housing crisis. A commitment of this magnitude for one crore families exhibits that the Centre is serious about making urban development inclusive. The contribution by Centre, which will be ₹2.2 lakh crore over a period of five years, gives financial muscle to the scheme. This huge investment is most likely to have far-reaching effects beyond the simple provision of housing. It could stimulate the construction sector, create millions of jobs, and boost allied industries. What’s more, along with mixing poor and middle-class families, the scheme recognizes the variety of housing needs across the socio-economic spectrum in urban India. Such an approach could usefully contribute to the reduction of inequality within cities and improve living conditions within India’s fast-growing towns.”

Aman Gupta, Director of RPS Group: “Ambitious targets for meeting the housing needs of 1 crore urban families under PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 point toward the enormity of the challenge that is urban housing in India. With projected urbanization to reach 50 percent in 2050, this ₹10-lakh-crore investment had been most timely and sorely required. The ₹2.2 lakh crore central assistance is a very strong model of public-private partnership, in which government support will act as a catalyst for private investment. This could result in innovative financing models and construction technologies in the affordable housing sector. Moreover, unlike most housing policies that leave out this ‘missing middle,’ the scheme targets both poor and middle-class families. If implemented correctly, this can potentially reduce a huge urban housing shortage of 18.78 million units in the year 2012 and change the urban landscape of India. It is a game-changing announcement that the FM made by stating an investment of ₹10 lakh crore in urban housing under PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 for India’s real estate sector.”

Anurag Goel, Director at Goel Ganga Developments: “The FM’s announcement of ₹10 lakh crore investment in urban housing under PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 is thus a shot in the arm for India’s real estate sector. This huge infusion—₹2.2 lakh crore in central assistance—can indeed rejuvenate the affordable segment of housing, which has remained in a challenging position over the past few years. For the target of 1 crore families within five years, it translates to about 20 lakh houses per annum, which becomes a significant scaling-up from the current version of the scheme. It can also generate enhanced demand for construction materials and may revive sectors such as cement, steel, and home appliances. It is in this regard that additional focus on the middle-class families, apart from the urban poor, broadens the scheme’s scope and possibly leads to more diversified housing typologies and urban design solutions. This kind of holistic approach can play a huge role in realizing the government’s vision of ‘Housing for All’.”

Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited: “The outlay of ₹10 lakh crore for urban housing under PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 is of an amount that would largely share in the annual GDP of India, thus showing the priority in the housing sector by the government. The ₹2.2 lakh crore central assistance spread over five years offers a stable funding base, which is so important to long-term planning in the real estate sector. Targeting 1 crore families, this scheme addresses roughly 22% of India’s urban households, according to the 2011 census. The scale of intervention would be large enough to hopefully bring down urban poverty, for adequate housing has been inextricably interwoven with health, education, and economic outcomes. Besides, incorporating middle-class families at least gives due recognition to the budding aspirations of India’s urban population. If effectively implemented, this has the potential to go a long way in bridging the yawning urban housing gap and making critically vital contributions toward India’s economic growth and development across the urban landscape.”

Ravi Saund, Founding Director, Emperium Private Limited: “The Finance Minister’s announcement of a Rs 10 lakh crore investment in urban housing through PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 represents a major boost for India’s real estate sector. The Rs 2.2 lakh crore allocated for central assistance will revitalize the affordable housing segment, which has struggled in recent years. With a target of providing homes to 1 crore families over the next five years, this initiative translates to approximately 20 lakh houses annually, marking a substantial increase from the previous scheme. This surge in construction activity is expected to boost demand for building materials and rejuvenate related industries such as cement, steel, and home appliances. By extending its focus to middle-class families in addition to the urban poor, the scheme’s expanded scope promises to foster diverse housing solutions and innovations in urban design. This comprehensive approach is a significant step towards achieving the government’s ‘Housing for All’ vision.”

Vikas Aggarwal, COO, Worldwide Realty: “FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s bold move to allocate Rs 10 lakh crore to the PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 marks a pivotal moment for the real estate sector. As urbanization accelerates towards 50% by 2050, this comprehensive investment is exactly what is needed to meet the burgeoning housing demands. The substantial Rs 2.2 lakh crore central assistance is a testament to the government’s strategic vision for fostering public-private collaborations. This financial backing is expected to spur innovative solutions in affordable housing and bring forward advanced construction methods. Notably, the scheme’s inclusive approach, addressing both the underprivileged and the middle class, fills a critical gap left by previous policies. With proper implementation, this initiative holds the potential to alleviate the vast urban housing deficit and reshape India’s urban environments significantly.”

Saransh Trehan, Managing Director, Trehan Group: “The essentiality for Housing for All becomes the mainstay for Budget 2024 yet again as the announcement of PMAY Urban Housing 2.0 becomes one of the salient attractions. Under the scheme, the government offers to provide homes at subsidized rates and allocates Rs 10 lakh crore for the initiative. The introduction of Rental housing to be built on PPP mode and upsizing of retail infrastructure will be crucial in empowering the real estate sector and housing segments and promoting all forms of property developments in metro as well as Tier 2 and 3 cities.”

Dushyant Singh, Director, Orion One 32: “The Union Budget 2024 offers some promising roads to development, urbanization, and infrastructural developments. The announcement of Urban Housing 2.0 with a budget allocation of Rs 10 lakh crore will secure the lives of thousands of people struggling to make two ends meet and living in makeshift homes in urban cities and towns. The availability of homes at subsidized rates will incentivize them to invest in properties. On the other hand, the government’s focus on rental housing expected to be built on PPP mode is also approbation-worthy and designed to improve living conditions for industrial workers.”

Neeraj K Mishra, Executive Director, Ganga Realty: “As one of the largest employment-generating sectors in India, a renewed focus on employment creation in the Union Budget 2024 is noteworthy and will attract upskilled talent in real estate too. It also recognizes infrastructural development as one of the critical growth propellers and promote state-level infrastructural developments to attract key investments in different parts of the country. With the promulgation of PMAY Urban Housing 2.0 and the earmarking of 10 lakh crore for the programme, the government once again prioritizes its core agenda of achieving Housing for All in Budget 2024. Providing homes at subsidized rates will be instrumental in alleviating thousands of people from a life of poverty and destitution and imbuing their lives with one of the qualitative facilities, which is also a crucial marker of judging the quality of life- housing. While allocating fresh budgets for emboldening housing has become a commonality in Budget announcements, the focus on rental housing for industrial workers, which will be taken up in a PPP mode, comes off as a good surprise and a refreshing step towards promoting diverse forms of housing.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-sets-the-stage-for-a-sustainable-growth-trajectory-for-real-estate-3563135/
financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: ‘Need to recognise indispensable role of technology in shaping the future of healthcare’,"Union Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will announce the Union Budget 2024-25 today. Industry leaders emphasise on building infrastructure and technology for healthcare.

“We expect a budget that fortifies the cornerstone of our nation’s healthcare system. A robust and sturdy healthcare system is essential to India’s economic development. We believe that the budget will place more of an emphasis on building infrastructure and technology for healthcare as well as on hiring qualified medical personnel. Improving these fundamental elements would make it possible to provide better healthcare services and guarantee that underserved areas and low-income individuals are sufficiently serviced,” Dr Vaibhav Kapoor, Co-founder, Pristyn Care told Financial Express.com.

A robust healthcare system is vital for our population’s well-being and the country’s overall growth, Dr. Kapoor said.



“India must strengthen its infrastructure, invest in advanced medical technologies and enable trajectories for upskilling of healthcare professionals. Healthcare technology strengthening can enable doctors to scale up patient care and management and open new pathways to a futuristic care ecosystem,” he said.

Meanwhile, Rahul Cordeiro, CFO, of Wipro GE Healthcare said that in 2023-24, the budget underscored the importance of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.



“Today, India is preparing to become ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. As we set a visionary blueprint for growth, the first Union Budget of the government is particularly significant for healthcare sector. As India aims to become the global manufacturing and MedTech hub, the country needs a promising outlay for the sector to encourage collaboration in R&D and high-end indigenous manufacturing and research. While National Medical Devices Policy 2023, Production Linked Incentive Scheme, Promotion of Research, and Innovation in Pharma MedTech Sector (PRIP) Scheme will help India unlock its full potential, the dependency on import continues to be a challenge,” Cordeiro told Financial Express.com.

We must solve for the persisting headwinds that have long impacted the sector, import dependence being one, he said.

“We are hopeful the budget will answer some critical questions such as – how can we accelerate the pace for ‘Make in India’ by prioritizing sourcing of domestically manufactured MedTech, can rebates to private healthcare providers buying local equipment, especially in underserved areas, incentivize wider adoption, and how can we boost local R&D through Innovation Linked Incentive schemes on the lines of PLI for manufacturing,” he added.

According to Sameer Dashputre, Chief Strategy Officer & Co-Founder, Dozee, delivering quality healthcare across wide geography with limited Human Resources is India’s key challenge.

“Technology is the biggest force multiplier which will enable us to bridge the gap in shorter time and lesser cost. We recommend fund allocation for a dedicated Bharat Healthtech AI for developing and implementing large-scale adoption of indigenous AI-powered technologies. The focus of the AI technologies should be on addressing the shortage of medical skills and mass screening for NCD control,” Dashputre told Financial Express.com.

Moreover, Sajeev Nair, Founder and Chairman, Vieroots the Union Budget 2024 should recognize the indispensable role of technology in shaping the future of healthcare.

“Investments in digital health solutions, telemedicine, and health informatics can bridge the gap between urban and rural healthcare accessibility. The government should consider incentivizing startups that leverage technology to enhance healthcare delivery, ensuring that the benefits of innovation are widespread and not confined to urban centres,” Nair told Financial Express.com.

Additionally, the government should allocate more resources for preventive health measures, including screening, prognosis, and cardiac and cancer risk assessment, given India’s high mortality rates in these areas, he said.

According to Nair, a stronger focus on the ‘Fit India’ movement is crucial, as awareness is the key to success. Just as the government successfully promoted the Swachh Bharat Mission through extensive awareness campaigns, a similar approach should be adopted for the Fit India campaign. With the average age of the Indian population around 30, motivating individuals to stay healthy and fit will significantly boost national productivity.



“Access to quality healthcare should be a fundamental right for every individual, irrespective of socioeconomic status. Achieving universal healthcare coverage requires concerted efforts from both the public and private sectors, along with policy interventions to bridge healthcare disparities. Increased medical education should not solely focus on producing more doctors but also prioritize holistic healthcare delivery,” Nair told Financial Express.com.

Moreover, the government has increased the allocation of Rs 1,100 crore for biotechnology research and development. The output of biotechnology R&D tangibly touches our everyday lives. Biotech innovations in healthcare have led to groundbreaking treatments, improved diagnostic tools, and personalized medicine. Therefore, the government should continue to remain focused on biotechnology R&D to provide better healthcare to society at large, he said.

“The Union Budget 2024 should emphasize preventive health measures, technological advancements, and universal healthcare access. These steps will ensure a healthier, more productive population and a robust healthcare system,” he added.

Tetsuya Yamada, MD, OMRON Healthcare India India’s healthcare system faces a significant challenge due to the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

“One of the main types of NCD is cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke which have hypertension as one of the primary underlying causes. India has more than 220 million people who suffer from high blood pressure, but a WHO study showed that only 15% of them receive treatment. Around 5% of them use a digital BP monitor. This implies that most of them are unaware of their condition, or they don’t get the proper treatment. To effectively address this concern, it is crucial to raise awareness about the issue and its potential solutions, such as the regular monitoring of hypertension and ECG at home, to ensure more proactive health management,” Yamada told Financial Express.com.

We hope that the government will keep in mind the importance of implementing policies and promoting widespread knowledge of preventive care, which can reduce the burden of costs for hospitalization and surgery, he added.

“Additionally, it is equally important to monitor the market and maintain the quality and availability of home healthcare monitoring devices. This will help prevent the circulation of counterfeit medical-grade devices in the market, which could hinder the advancement of healthcare. We anticipate that the Union Budget 2024-25 will reflect a forward-thinking approach including preventive care at home, aligning with industry needs, and ultimately establishing a resilient and advanced healthcare framework,” he pointed out.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-need-to-recognise-indispensable-role-of-technology-in-shaping-the-future-of-healthcare-3561703/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: These cancer medicines get custom duty exemption – What does this exactly means,"Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday tabled the Union Budget 2024-25. Although there was no major scheme announcement for the healthcare sector, the Finance Minister proposed the complete exemption of three cancer medicines from basic customs duty.

The government has proposed to remove the custom duties for these medicines, Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, Osimertinib and Durvalumab, from 10 percent to nil.

Dr. Mandeep Singh Malhotra, Director of Surgical Oncology at CK Birla Hospital, Delhi highlighted some critical aspects of these life-saving cancer medicines and the impact of custom duty exemption.



What are these drugs used for specifically?

Trastuzumab Deruxtecan: This is an antibody-drug conjugate used primarily to treat HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). It is also being studied for use in other types of cancer, such as gastric cancer.

This is an antibody-drug conjugate used primarily to treat HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). It is also being studied for use in other types of cancer, such as gastric cancer. Osimertinib: This is a targeted therapy used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific mutations in the EGFR gene. It is particularly effective against cancers that have developed resistance to earlier generations of EGFR inhibitors.

This is a targeted therapy used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific mutations in the EGFR gene. It is particularly effective against cancers that have developed resistance to earlier generations of EGFR inhibitors. Durvalumab: This is an immunotherapy drug that works by blocking the PD-L1 protein, helping the immune system to attack cancer cells. It is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer).

How much will the cost come down?

The exact reduction in cost will depend on the current customs duty rates and other associated costs such as import taxes and logistics, Dr. Malhotra explained. According to Dr. Malhotra, exemption from basic customs duty could potentially reduce the price by 10-20 percent, making these treatments more affordable for patients. However, precise figures would require detailed pricing and duty structure analysis, he highlighted.

How commonly are these drugs prescribed?

Trastuzumab Deruxtecan: This is commonly prescribed for patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer who have not responded to other treatments. It is relatively new but has shown significant promise in clinical trials.

These initiatives, she explained, are designed to leverage enrolment in the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO).

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: Standard deduction for salaried class increased from 50,000 to 75,000","In a bid to give a boost to salaried taxpayers, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday increased the Standard Deduction limit from 50,000 to 75,000. But the deduction is applicable only in the New Tax Regime, while its limit remains unchanged in the Old Tax Regime.

Commenting on the same, Adhil Shetty, CEO of Bankbazaar.com, said, “The Union Budget’s proposal to raise the standard tax deduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 is a crucial move to reduce the financial strain on taxpayers. This increase will offer greater relief by reducing taxable income, enabling taxpayers to save more and enhance their financial well-being. It is particularly advantageous for middle-income earners, as it boosts their disposable income and promotes savings and investment.”

Rahul Jain, President and Head, Nuvama Wealth, said, “The personal income tax in the new regime has seen two significant improvements. Initially, the standard deduction has been raised to Rs 75,000, marking a 50% increase. Additionally, the revision of three income slabs has been implemented. The new regime will result in reduced tax liability, potentially saving up to Rs 17,500, as mentioned in the budget speech. This will put more money in the hands of individuals, boosting personal consumption.”



It may be noted that the standard deduction is a set amount that can be claimed by employees without having to show proof of the actual expenses they have incurred. This deduction has a long history, having been available for many years before being eliminated in 2005, only to be reinstated in the 2018 Union Budget. Initially set at Rs 40,000 in the Budget 2018, the standard deduction was later raised to Rs 50,000 in the following Budget. This deduction was later introduced in the new tax regime in the Budget 2023.

Tax experts were of the opinion that the current standard deduction of Rs 50,000 might not be sufficient to cover the rising costs and expenses related to a higher standard of living. Therefore, there was a necessity to raise its limit. This adjustment would also create fairness with individuals earning income from business or profession, who have the option to claim actual expenses or choose a presumptive basis of taxation.

Additionally, following the pandemic, medical expenses had increased, which also needed to be taken into account when contemplating an increase in the standard deduction. To tackle these issues, there was a popular expectation for the standard deduction to be increased to Rs 1 lakh from the current limit of Rs 50,000.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-standard-deduction-for-salaried-class-increased-from-50000-to-75000-3560890/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: Tax slab changes, Standard Deduction hike to Rs 75K enhance New Tax Regime’s appeal among taxpayers","As widely expected, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech on Tuesday proposed some changes in the New Tax Regime to enhance its appeal among taxpayers. First, Standard Deduction for salaried employees was proposed to be increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000, while deduction on family pension for pensioners was increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000.

Apart from this, tax slabs under the new tax regime were proposed to be simplified, which will encourage more taxpayers to switch from the Old Tax Regime.

Commenting on this, Adhil Shetty, CEO of Bankbazaar.com, said, “The Union Budget 2024-25 has further simplified the tax slabs under the new tax regime, encouraging more taxpayers to switch from the old regime, which still attracts a large percentage due to its wider deductions for various financial investments.”



The revised tax slabs are as follows: those earning Rs 3-7 lakh will pay 5%, while income between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 10 lakh will be taxed at 10%. Similarly, one will have to pay 15% tax on income between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, while income from Rs 12-15 lakh will fall under the 20% tax slab, and those earning above Rs 15 lakh will be taxed at 30%.

Additionally, the standard deduction has been increased, allowing taxpayers to save approximately Rs 17,500 more under the new regime.

“The simplified tax structure aims to make the new tax regime more attractive by reducing complexity and potentially lowering the tax burden for middle-income earners. By setting lower rates for intermediate income brackets, the government is addressing a key concern that has kept many taxpayers in the old regime—its extensive deductions and exemptions,” added Shetty.

It may be noted that the New Tax Regime, introduced in the Budget 2020 with altered tax slabs and concessional tax rates but minimal exemptions and deductions from income, was supposed to herald a new era for India in the field of taxation. However, it failed to take off owing to low interest of taxpayers.

In a bid to increase its adoption rate among taxpayers, several changes were made in this regime in the Budget 2023. For example, the rebate limit was increased to Rs 7 lakh from Rs 5 lakh earlier, and the number of slabs were reduced from 6 to 5, while the tax exemption limit was increased to Rs 3 lakh.

The New Regime was also made the default option. Still, compared to the old regime, the new regime was less popular among taxpayers because of not giving them many options to make tax-saving investments.

Tax experts, therefore, wanted the government to contemplate raising the basic exemption limit in the New Tax Regime from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, and tax rebate from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh. They also suggested to impose the 30% tax rate at an income of Rs 20 lakh or Rs 25 lakh, rather than the current Rs 15 lakh, making the tax system more equitable.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-tax-slab-changes-standard-deduction-hike-to-rs-75k-enhance-new-tax-regimes-appeal-among-taxpayers-3560903/

Nirmala Sitharaman, adorned in a white silk saree featuring a magenta border, posed alongside her team for the traditional ‘briefcase’ photograph outside her office. The occasion preceded her meeting with President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhawan.



Budget 2023: A Statement of Simplicity and Elegance

In her most recent budget presentation, Nirmala Sitharaman opted for a striking red silk saree adorned with a black and gold temple border.

This understated yet elegant ensemble underscored the significance of the occasion, being the last full budget before the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections.



Union Budget 2022: Embracing Cultural Diversity

During the 2022 budget session, Sitharaman arrived at Parliament draped in a rust and maroon handloom saree from Odisha, featuring delicate silver thread work along the border. This choice highlighted her appreciation for India’s rich textile heritage, amidst speculations of a Benarasi saree choice, possibly influenced by the imminent UP assembly elections.

In her maiden budget presentation in 2019, Nirmala Sitharaman made headlines not only for her policies but also for her attire—a bright pink Mangalgiri saree with a gold border. Significantly, she eschewed the colonial-era briefcase for carrying the budget papers, opting instead for a traditional ‘bahi khata’, symbolizing a departure from established norms towards embracing indigenous practices.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Switching tax regimes to be allowed for all? Experts seek a more taxpayer-friendly system,"Ahead of the Union Budget 2024, tax experts have called for a more flexible tax system, urging the government to allow all taxpayers the option to switch between tax regimes.

They argue that this change in taxation policy would help taxpayers plan their investments in a better manner, ultimately leading to a more taxpayer-friendly system. If the government allows taxpayers this flexibility, this would promote fairness and efficiency in the tax framework.

Who can switch personal income tax regimes in India?

Earlier, when the new tax regime was introduced there was no restriction on how many times one can change tax regime, irrespective of the status of the taxpayer. Both non-salaried and salaried taxpayers were allowed to change the tax regime next year from the other regime they opted in that particular financial year.



However, now only individual and HUF taxpayers have the option to choose between the old and new tax regimes on a year-by-year basis. Those earning income from business or profession who opt out of the current new tax regime under Section 115 BAC can only return to it once.



This restriction places diligent and compliant professionals at a significant disadvantage. Consequently, it is expected that the Union Budget 2024 will introduce greater flexibility, allowing professionals to switch between the old and new tax regimes on an annual basis, say experts.

Union Budget 2023: Key Changes in Tax Regime Switching Rules

In the Union Budget 2023, the government introduced significant changes to the rules for switching income tax regimes. One major update was designating the new tax regime as the default option if a taxpayer does not specify their preference. Additionally, individuals with business income and non-salaried professionals are now permitted to switch their tax regime only once. This means that if they opt for the new tax system, they will not be able to revert to the old regime.

Taxpayers earning income from a business or profession are restricted to changing tax regimes only once. They have the option to switch between the old and new regimes during ITR filing. To make this transition, they must submit Form 10-IE along with their ITR.



What is Form 10IE?

Taxpayers — whether individuals or HUFs — with business or professional income are required to file Form 10-IE when opting for the new tax regime. This form serves as a declaration of your switch to the new regime and must be submitted before filing your ITR. By completing this form, you notify the Income-Tax Department of your updated tax regime choice.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-switching-tax-regimes-to-be-allowed-for-all-experts-seek-a-more-taxpayer-friendly-system-3560757/

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Expectations of the Automotive and Technology Industry,"By- Neelesh Talathi

Envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Viksit Bharat 2047 sets an ambitious roadmap for India’s transformation into a developed nation by its centenary of independence. This vision aims to elevate India’s economic, social, and environmental standing on the global stage. With a GDP growth of 7.6% in FY 2023-24, India has become the world’s fifth-largest economy. Contributing 16% to global growth in 2023, India is now playing a significant role on the world stage.

The Automotive Sector



The automotive industry has a 7.1% contribution to India’s GDP. The sector’s impact extends beyond economic figures, with a significant contribution in creating employment. As we approach the Union Budget 2024, there are clear expectations for further support to innovation and competitiveness in the auto industry.

Make India Prima-Donna of FDI Inflows: India is the world’s 3rd largest automobile market with a substantive consumption domestically and enjoying a 4.7% share in Indian exports. This is on the back of strong domestic demand, well-developed component manufacturing eco-system, and policy support from the Government of India. The sector has attracted cumulative equity foreign investment of US$ 35.40 billion between April 2000 and September 2023. Opportunity remains to make India the global leader in shared mobility by 2030, to gain leadership in heavy truck manufacturing (presently 3rd largest) & car (from #4), and drive the next wave of development on Electrical Vehicles. Of this only to meet India’s EV ambition by 2030 calls for an investment of US$180bn.

The automotive industry expects stepped-up momentum in creating a conducive environment to boost Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows. These measures could include greater allocation to the automobile industry under the PLI schemes, tax benefits linked to investment for EV and employment, and measures to streamline approval processes to enhance the ease of doing business.

Winning in India’s EV Sector: India has made international commitments to reduce economy-wide emission intensity by 45% below 2005 levels by 2030. Further, Indian imports on account of oil add up to around US$ 100bn. A shift to Electrical Vehicles is not merely a solution to these challenges but also an opportunity to gain global leadership in a relatively nascent and fast-growing industry.

With an EV penetration rate at under 1%, many factors need to come together to address the key blockers which according to a study by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minster (EAC-PM) include high cost, range anxiety, limited model options and unknow resale value. While winning in Electrical Vehicles is admittedly not only going to be about budgetary support it is noteworthy that between 2009-2022 the Chinese Government poured US$29Bn into subsidies and tax breaks for Chinese EV manufacturers.

In this budget the automobile industry would like for the Honorable Finance Minister to focus on facilitating creating charging infrastructure (India needs 1.3Mn vs around 13000 presently), Tax Rebates on leasing of Electrical Vehicles (solution for concerns on resale value) and mandate all new procurement by the government to be only electrical vehicles. What better way of persuading the common man than to follow our own leaders?

Innovation and R&D: Research and Development (R&D) investments are crucial for the success of the ‘Make in India’ campaign and for keeping India competitive on the global stage. The Union Budget 2023 underscored the importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by announcing the establishment of three ‘Centres of Excellence’ for AI to enable ‘Make AI for India’ and ‘Make AI Work for India’. Budget 2024 is expected to further boost R&D initiatives, particularly in areas such as advanced batteries, electric vehicles, and connected infrastructure. This focus on innovation will be key to driving technological advancements and fostering an environment of continuous improvement.

Enable Start-ups to disrupt more: Numerous innovations & disruptions have been germinated by our start-up industry in the automobile sector including strides being made in autonomous cars, hi-tech low-cost solutions to battery charging, affordable mobility solutions, Artificial Intelligence (AI) in consumer discovery and data-based solutions on financing, insurance, etc.

India today ranks in the 40th position in the Global Innovation Index 2023; with the brain pool that India has, we should be aspiring to be in the Top 10. While we have successfully created a vibrant entrepreneurial fraternity there is more that needs to be done to unshackle the willingness to take risk. Trapping like “Angel Tax” (Sec 56(2) (viib) of Income Tax Act) needs to be urgently undone and the budget should set out a clear message about fostering trust between the Tax administrators and the Taxpayers. According to data from PrivateCircle Research as reported by Hindu Business Line, former employees of just one successful Indian start-up have founded around 44 start-ups with a cumulative valuation of US$25Bn (as of Feb 24).

If steps are taken in this budget to remove dual taxation on ESOP (presently suffers both Perquisite Tax and Capital Gain Tax) it will put more money in the hands of younger Indians to convert their ideas into viable ventures, paving the way for India’s aspiration to be in the Top10 in the Global Innovation Index.

As concluding remarks and to steal a line from the auto industry, in an otherwise bumpy global doom & gloom, the Indian economy is very much on an auto-cruise mode. We hope to see Union Budget 2024 clear all roadblocks and provide the rocket fuel to accelerate our leap towards Viksit Bharat.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Realtors want Govt to focus on ways to propel housing demand further,"The real estate sector has played a key role in shaping India’s economic growth. The sector not just generates substantial employment opportunities but also brings in a lot of foreign and domestic investment. The demand for housing, offices, retail, warehousing etc. is not limited to India’s metros but also tier 2 and 3 cities that have been playing an important role with their robust connectivity and infrastructure developments.

According to a report by data analytics firm PropEquity, housing transactions in the top 30 Tier II cities rose by 11% year-on-year to almost 2.08 lakh units in the previous fiscal year due to strong consumer demand fueled by solid economic expansion, infrastructure enhancements, and increasing aspiration for property ownership. Data indicates that housing unit sales in India’s 30 key Tier II cities reached 2.07 lakh units in 2023-24, up from 1.86 lakh units in the previous financial year. Interestingly, the data showed that out of these 30 cities, the top 10 cities contributed 80% to the total sales. Housing sales in India’s top seven cities continue to be robust.





To keep this momentum going, real estate developers believe the Budget 2024 must focus on propelling this demand further.

Samir Jasuja, Founder and CEO of PropEquity said, “Increasing the interest deduction limit under Section 24B of the Income Tax Act would allow homeowners to claim a higher amount of interest paid on their home loans as a tax deduction, potentially providing significant tax relief. The single-window clearance system aims to consolidate all development authorities under one roof, ensuring timely approvals for real estate projects.”

Vivek Singhal, CEO Smartworld Developers said, “Positive outlook is being observed regarding upcoming policy adjustments, including possible decreases in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates and initiatives to stabilize material costs. A significant advancement could come from the complete exemption of interest paid on home loans under section 24, surpassing the current cap of Rs 2 lakh, and the increase in the standard deduction limit under section 80C, which could result in a higher amount of disposable income for consumers. Furthermore, there are hopes for tax benefits and expanded deduction limits on home loans.”

The real estate industry has demonstrated remarkable resilience amidst a global economic downturn and increasing input expenses, thereby sustaining the balance between demand and supply.

“However, the industry should be acknowledged for its role in driving economic growth, generating employment, and developing top-notch infrastructure by implementing tax cuts and adjusting GST input tax credit regulations to lower property costs and boost demand in all types of assets. Additionally, the longstanding request of granting industry status to the sector should be prioritized to support the government’s goal of providing housing for all and reaching a $5-trillion economy by 2025,” said Angad Bedi, MD, BCD Group.

Mohit Malhotra, Founder & CEO, NeoLiv said, “Our primary focus is on the mid-housing segment, which is crucial for us. We expect that this will lead to the emergence of fresh development prospects due to higher budget allocations for infrastructure. This, in turn, will make it more convenient to reach city centers, which is vital for mid-range housing initiatives aimed at meeting the requirements of the middle-income population. We are eager for the budget to acknowledge the future possibilities within this segment. We are optimistic that it will encompass measures to empower emerging developers with strong financial backing and clear-cut policies, thus nurturing the expansion of the housing industry in the nation.”

“It is imperative for the government to consider increasing the cap on interest payment deductions for home loans from the current Rs 2 lakh annually to Rs 5 lakh. This move would significantly boost housing demand, particularly in light of the significant surge in housing prices and mortgage rates in the last 1-2 years,” said Vijay Harsh Jha, founder and CEO, VS Realtors (I) Pvt Ltd, a Gurugram-based property brokerage firm.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-realtors-want-govt-to-focus-on-ways-to-propel-housing-demand-further-3560177/

The recent bull run, leading up to the Budget session, reflects strong investor sentiment fueled by expectations of policy announcements and support for domestic cyclicals and growth-oriented sectors in the upcoming Union Budget 2024.

Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty experienced minor gains last week, extending their winning streak to seven weeks. However, a sharp decline in the previous session erased most of the weekly gains. On Friday, investors rushed to book profits following four days of record-breaking rallies and a global sell-off triggered by an IT outage causing widespread device crashes.

The rally in benchmark indices last week was driven by IT stocks, buoyed by strong Q1FY25 performance and expectations of a US Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Notably, the BSE benchmark hit the 81,000-mark for the first time on Thursday.



GIFT Nifty traded down by 117.50 points or 0.48% at 24,416.50 indicating a negative opening for domestic indices NSE Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex on Monday. Previously, on Friday, the NSE Nifty 50 ended down by 269.95 points or 1.09% to settle at 24,530.90 while the BSE Sensex fell 738.81 points or 0.91% to 80,604.65.

“Markets experienced profit-taking and shed nearly a percent, erasing the gains of the previous trading session. After a flat start, the Nifty gradually declined throughout the day, ultimately closing near the day’s low at 24,530.90 level. Most sectors ended lower, with metals, realty, and energy being the top losers. The broader indices also faced pressure, dropping over 2% each,” said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking.

Mishra also added that This decline signals caution ahead of the Union Budget, as participants chose to book profits. We may see further dips in the Nifty, with the next crucial support at the 24,150 level, corresponding to the 20 DEMA. Traders are advised to avoid aggressive positions and opt for hedged trades. It is also recommended to focus on index majors rather than midcap and smallcap stocks for now.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Smarter tax for smarter tech,"– By Naveen Aggarwal

India’s technology sector continues to demonstrate resilience amidst weaker global contracts, subdued hiring activities and clampdown on discretionary spend. With AI / GenAI taking center stage, there is increasing emphasis on areas such as semiconductors, data processing, cybersecurity, blockchain, amongst others. The sector expects this year’s budget to bring the much-needed reforms that will help unleash the next phase of exponential growth.

More legroom on Safe Harbors



Safe harbor provisions provide certainty and relief from rigorous tax scrutiny to taxpayers complying with specified conditions. The margin rate currently prescribed for IT and routine software development services is 17-18% for international transactions up to INR 200 crores. This is higher than the comparable benchmark and commercially unviable for taxpayers to adopt, thus the need to revisit the current margin rates and align it with global trends.

Additionally, the present threshold of INR 200 crores eliminates several medium sized companies and almost all the large companies from purview of safe harbour provisions, as the international transactions undertaken will likely surpass the limit. To augment a more comprehensive regime, the government should consider abolishing the threshold or increasing it to at least INR 1,000 crore, and also bringing in routine engineering design transactions also within the ambit, which will help attract fresh investments in the sector.

Fast tracking Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)

The average timeline to conclude APAs’ in India is 4-5 years and, in many cases, get concluded post expiry of the period sought to be covered under the APA. During the period when APA is under negotiation, taxpayers are subjected to regular transfer pricing audits. There is a need to prescribe a timeline for concluding the same, including introducing a mechanism to fast-track processing of renewal applications as well as APAs’ for standard transactions, simplifying the compliances and holding regular audit proceedings in abeyance till APA process is ongoing. This will make the APA route more attractive and provide a predictable tax regime for technology companies with growing India interest.

Driving certainty on Significant Economic Presence (SEP) and Equalization Levy (EL)

Despite being a frontrunner in introducing these measures to tax the digital economy, ambiguities remain around its scope and compliance remit. Clarity is required around aspects such as its interplay with royalty, fee for technical services (FTS) transactions and attribution of profits in respect of SEP, etc. The expectation is that this year’s budget will likely refine these SEP provisions / guidelines to ensure that digital businesses are taxed fairly.

On EL, a critical ask is that the levy deposited should be allowed to be adjusted against the income tax liability in case of subsequent Permanent Establishment (PE) determination or Royalty/ FTS characterization. With EL here to stay, considering the uncertainty around ratification of BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Pillar One, an appeal mechanism for EL related disputes will help bring stability in the tax ecosystem.

Defined roadmap on implementation of BEPS Pillar Two

The sector, with its international operations and intricate value chains, is expected to get impacted by the global tax deal on BEPS. Several countries such as UK, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, members of the European Union, amongst others have already adopted or looking to adopt BEPS Pillar Two. Therefore, a clear roadmap towards its implementation, which aims to deter profit shifting by setting a minimum effective tax rate of 15% for large multinationals, will be essential for companies to plan and comply effectively.

Relief from TCS on ESOPs

Pursuant to the recent amendments in overseas investment and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) regulations, remittance in respect of ESOPs issued by foreign entities to Indian subsidiary’s employees are covered within the LRS limit and potentially subject to TCS at 20%. While employees can claim credit in their income-tax returns, such TCS has a significant cash-flow impact. Remittance in respect of stock plans is out of the employees’ tax paid salary and the perquisite component is also tracked under the withholding tax provisions. There is therefore a need to provide relief from applicability of TCS on ESOPs and similar plans to help maintain their attractiveness as an employee retention tool.

Adding thrust to Make in India

One expects the PLI to get extended to newer sectors that involve manufacturing across hi-tech products, consumer and industrial electronics, computers, etc., bolstering domestic production and attracting investments. Growing sectors such as space, drones, in fact the growing tech startups, would greatly benefit from this fillip and keep the momentum going on the ‘Make in India’ sentiment.

No surprises, the tech sector will play the anchor role in India’s $10 Tn journey, given its heft in driving innovation, drawing investments and employment generation. One is hopeful that this budget sets the tone for a transformative growth led agenda for this sector to help build a globally competitive business ecosystem in the time to come.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Govt employees await big announcement on 8th Pay Commission formation! Will FM Sitharaman deliver?,"8th Pay Commission: As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present her 7th Union Budget on July 23, expectations are running high among government employees that the FM would announce the 8th Pay Commission in her budget speech. Over 49 lakh central government employees and 67 lakh pensioners are eagerly waiting for the Modi government to announce setting up the 8th Pay Commission.



In recent times, several bodies and unions representing central government employees have submitted proposals to the Centre on the 8th Pay Commission, the restoration of the old pension scheme, and the release of 18 months’ dearness allowance arrears.

FM Sitharaman may make a major announcement regarding the establishment of the 8th Pay Commission in tomorrow’s budget, according to reports.



Historically, a new pay commission has been established every ten years. If the Modi government follows this pattern and introduces the 8th Pay Commission in 2025-26, it could result in a salary increase of up to 44.44%.



Central govt employees and advisory councils press for 8th Pay Commission formation

Central government employees have consistently pressed for the formation of the 8th Pay Commission through various forums. Numerous employee committees have repeatedly urged the central government to establish the 8th Pay Commission to revise basic salaries, allowances, pensions, and other benefits.

In a recent letter to the Cabinet Secretary of the Government of India, SB Yadav, General Secretary of the Employees Federation, called for the creation of the 8th Pay Commission, the restoration of the old pension scheme, the release of 18 months’ dearness allowance, and additional relief for employees and pensioners.

The National Council of Joint Advisory Machinery has also echoed the demand for the formation of the 8th Pay Commission. General Secretary C. Srikumar has confirmed that this request will be formally presented to the central government.

However, it’s important to note that the Modi government has not yet officially announced the establishment of the 8th Pay Commission, and no specific implementation date has been set. Typically, it takes around 12 to 18 months for a pay commission to formulate its recommendations after being established. During this period, the commission evaluates various factors, including current economic conditions, to propose adjustments to employee salaries and benefits.



Central govt employees demand increase in Fitment Factor from 2.57 to 3.68

Central government employees have been advocating for an increase in the fitment factor from 2.57 to 3.68. The fitment factor is a key multiplier used to calculate salaries and pensions for government employees. For example, the 2.57 fitment factor was applied when revising salaries from the 6th Central Pay Commission to the 7th Pay Commission.

The 6th Pay Commission proposed a fitment factor of 1.86, while the 7th Pay Commission set the factor at 2.57. This adjustment raised the minimum basic pay for central government employees to Rs 18,000 per month, up from Rs 7,000, reflecting a 2.57-fold increase from the previous commission. Employees are now urging the government to elevate the fitment factor to 3.68 to further enhance their salaries and benefits.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-govt-employees-await-big-announcement-on-8th-pay-commission-formation-will-fm-sitharaman-deliver-3560908/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: Centre vs State spending on education,"In the 2023 budget, the Ministry of Education was allocated Rs 1,12,899 crore, marking a 13 percent increase. This amount constitutes 2.9 percent of the central government’s overall estimated expenditure for FY24. However, the share of education spending in the aggregate expenditure of states and Union Territories (UTs) has been declining over the past decade. For the current financial year, 27 out of the 31 states and UTs have budgeted a lower proportion of expenditure on education compared to the average spending during the pre-pandemic period (FY16-20). “Considering that state budgets account for 60% of the net expenditure of the government in India, an increment in a state’s spending on education would be massively beneficial in enhancing the state’s landscape, and the overall improvement of education and literacy rates at the national level,” Chandrakant Patil, Minister of Higher and Technical Education, Maharashtra, told the financialexpress.com.

Patil further suggested that it is also important to not just focus on allocations as a headline number, but rather also look at the policies which are being unveiled by the Government to effectively channelize the allocations.

In FY24, an average of 14.7 percent of the budget of Indian states was allocated to education. The majority of funding for government schools comes from state governments, while the central government contributes through programmes such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), Teacher Education (TE), and mid-day meals. “Each state has unique priorities influenced by factors like demographics and socioeconomic barriers. Consequently, some states allocate more to their budgets, while others tailor their allocations to specific needs. States with established infrastructure and stable student enrolment require lower education funding, whereas those revamping their education systems allocate higher amounts to build capacity,” Praneet Mungali, Secretary, Sanskriti Group of Schools, Pune, said.



Public expenditure on education in India has been increasing annually since 2013. In 2022, an estimated RS 757,000 crore was spent by both the central and state governments. However, it is still very less from the recommended figure by the National Education Policy. The policy recommended that India allocate at least 6% of its GDP to education. However, actual public expenditure has remained around 2.8% of GDP. More than 85% of public education spending is covered by state governments. In 2022-23, states are estimated to bear 89.3% of the total education expenditure, while the central government contributes 10.7% through specific programmess. “Since the introduction of GST, revenue collection by states and UTs has fluctuated, leading to an unbalanced division of tax revenue and impacting overall expenditure. Additionally, vast demographics affect state education budgets, as some states classify spending on schools for certain castes (SC/ST) as welfare rather than education expenditure, creating an illusion of inadequate education funding,” Mungali explained.

In 2022-23, the central budget for education is projected to fall short by Rs 7,100 crore, or 7% less than planned. Reports indicate that the gap between budgeted and actual expenditure has been widening since 2017, increasing from a 5.5% shortfall in 2017-18 to 7% in 2022-23. Conversely, state budgets are expected to exceed their planned education spending by 2.1% in 2022-23.

In 2022-23, total public education expenditure (central and state) is estimated to be 9.5% of combined central and state expenditures, down from 11.6% in 2013-14. The central government’s share is estimated at 2.3% of its total expenditure, while states are projected to spend 13% of their total expenditures on education. Delhi leads with 21.1% of its total expenditure allocated to education, followed by Bihar at 19.7%. In contrast, Telangana and Manipur have the lowest percentages, at 6.8% and 7.6%, respectively. “It is important to recognise that while we should always look for growth in budgets, it is equally significant to have a greater focus towards policies formalised to channelise the budgets and ensuring the overall utilisation of budgets,” Patil suggested.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budgetnbsp-2024-expectations-cantre-vs-state-spending-on-educationnbsp-3561330/
financialexpress.com,How Budget 2024 can influence Consumer Behavior in India,"– By Saket Gaurav

The Union Budget 2024 holds promise to steer India towards a high-growth trajectory. India’s economic progress can be shaped by implementing key changes in policies and reforms focused on industrial growth, particularly in consumer durables. Strategic changes, discussed below, can have a profound effect on consumer behavior across the country.



Tax Reforms and Reliefs



A lower tax rate or increased tax exemptions can lead to more disposable income for individuals, which will increase consumer expenditures, particularly in the consumer durables sector. Increased disposable money can drive sales of smartwatches and smart TVs as individuals feel safer and tend to spend more on leisure and health-related goods.

Subsidies and Incentives

In addition to subsidies and incentives available currently, consumers who buy electric vehicles or install solar power plants should receive additional benefits. These provisions will encourage more consumers to make eco-friendly choices, ultimately benefiting the environment.

Economic Growth Projections

The Union Budget 2024 should bring a holistic approach towards benefiting the economy. A thriving economy boosts consumers' confidence in their financial stability, encouraging them to invest in durable goods. This greater confidence frequently leads to higher purchases of products such as air conditioners, refrigerators, and other household appliances. As consumer spending rises significantly, it benefits both manufacturers and retailers.

Inflation Control Measures

We anticipate certain inflation-control measures this year from the budget that would stabilize prices and make commodities more affordable to end customers. When inflation is kept under control, purchasing power rises, allowing customers to spend more on their lifestyle. This may result in increased demand for consumer durables, as steady pricing makes these items more accessible to a larger audience.

Employment Generation Schemes

A number of special reforms for generating employment are expected in Budget 2024. Higher employment rates imply that more people have consistent incomes, which leads to increased spending power. As people strive to better their quality of life, they frequently increase their expenditure on lifestyle and durable goods.

Support for MSMEs and Startups

The rising pool of MSMEs and startups has the potential to significantly impact the Indian economy. When small and medium-sized businesses grow, consumers benefit from greater choice and variety. This promotes competition and innovation, which leads to improved products and services for customers. Encouraging the expansion of MSMEs and startups can result in a more dynamic and consumer-friendly market environment.

Infrastructure Development

Improved infrastructure, such as better roads and transportation networks, improves market access, making it easier for customers to buy goods and services. This benefits local economies while also increasing the consumer base for a variety of products, including consumer durables.

Digital India Initiatives

Digital India signifies a huge advancement in India’s economic development. Promoting e-commerce and digital payments through policies and improvements that promote Digital India, such as the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), can significantly impact consumer behavior. As more people shop online, the demand for digital payment solutions and e-commerce platforms increases. This change, aided by efforts such as ONDC, may result in an increase in online transactions, helping companies that adapt swiftly to digital trends.

Agricultural Reforms

The next wave of buyers will be from rural India. Special arrangements to promote rural incomes can lead to increased sales of consumer durables from rural areas. Consumers in rural areas are more likely to invest in improving their level of living if they have some discretionary income.

Healthcare Investments

Lower healthcare costs, such as reduced GST rates for health insurance, can allow individuals to spend more on lifestyle items and consumer durables. This can lead to greater demand for a wide range of items, which helps to boost overall economic growth.

Education and Skill Development Programs

Education and skill development initiatives increase career prospects, resulting in increased incomes for individuals. Consumers are more inclined to spend on education-related items and services as their career prospects improve and their wages rise. This can increase demand for smartwatches, computers, and other instructional tools, boosting the consumer durables industry.

As we anticipate these changes, businesses must adjust and align their strategy to meet the changing needs of consumers in this dynamic market climate.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Juggernaut keeps rolling,"– By Gaurav Mehndiratta and Palav Shah

With the Modi government embarking on its third term, the nation is standing at the cusp of unprecedented growth and transformation. The government’s continued commitment to driving growth and innovation should propel India towards a path of sustained progress and global influence thereby making it a dynamic investment destination poised to lead on the world stage amid global uncertainty.

The past ten years of the Modi Government have been focused on economic growth, digital initiatives, infrastructure development, transparency, and efficiency in tax administration.



As India marches towards the vision of becoming a 5 trillion US dollar economy by 2026, the Union Budget of 2024 set on the anvil in July is an opportune time for the Modi government to formulate policies and provide tax incentives that boost and accelerate growth, attract foreign investment, and create a tax friendly climate.

Backed by a politically stable environment, the corporate sector key wishlist encapsulated below is that the Budget 2024 will shape the landscape for a diverse array of sectors and bring in a new wave of fervent optimism to steer the country’s trajectory forward.

Extension of deadline for concessional corporate tax rate under Section 115BAB for new manufacturing companies

The sunset date of 31 March 2024 for concessional corporate tax rate of 15 percent available to new domestic manufacturing companies to be extended for at least five years to incentivize domestic production, reduce dependency on imports, boost investments both by foreign and Indian players into India and create more jobs and improve India’s manufacturing eco-system overall. The ambit of the concessional rate to be extended to certain other activities such as research and development, software development, data processing, production of films or testing services and be included in the list of qualifying businesses eligible for the concessional corporate tax rate to boost the SME sector.

Dispute Resolution and Fast tracking of CIT(A) Appeals

To augment the vision of reducing tax litigation, an additional amnesty scheme Vivad se Vishwas Scheme 2.0 be re-introduced to significantly reduce the back log of pending litigation. It is expected that the government introduces a comprehensive policy framework for reducing the pendency of CIT(A) by providing timelines by which the appeals should be disposed off and designing a framework for clubbing of pending appeals for same assessee having similar issues for different assessment years, disposing off high stake matters involving 10 crore or more on priority and matters involving 50 crore and above be directly taken up at the Tribunal level.

BEPS 2.0 – Minimum Corporate Tax Rules under ‘Pillar 2’

BEPS 2.0 – a significant development in the realm of international taxation, is an initiative by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. It aims to ensure that the multinational enterprises (MNEs) pay their fair share of taxes across tax jurisdictions.

Anticipations for the upcoming Budget revolve around the Government providing a roadmap for implementation of the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (GloBe Rules) under the Two-Pillar Solution with respect to Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up tax, Under-taxed Payment Rule in the domestic tax laws of India for MNEs operating in India.

It is also expected that India would implement the concept of Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) by participation in the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) which enables the source jurisdiction to levy a top up withholding tax if the residence country’s effective income tax rate on specified income categories falls below 9 percent.

One will also need to watch out whether post introduction of Pillar Two reforms, unilateral measures introduced by India such as Equalisation Levy (EL) and Significant Economic Presence (SEP) to tax digital businesses are phased out or not.

India-Mauritius protocol

In light of Action 6 of the BEPS Inclusive Framework, India and Mauritius signed a protocol amending the India-Mauritius Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) introducing the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) in the Preamble to the DTAA. The PPT provides that DTAA benefit will not be granted if it is reasonable to conclude that obtaining such benefit was one of the principal purposes. The said protocol has raised a plethora of questions regarding the investments made by various overseas companies in the past. Clarity with respect to the ‘retrospective’ applicability of the protocol and taxability of capital gains with respect to investments made prior to 1 April 2017 and, whether any grandfathering clause will be introduced to safeguard the investors interests are awaited and it is expected that both the countries will issue guidelines once the protocol is ratified and made effective.

Cross border mergers

Corporate and regulatory laws in India now permit both inbound and outbound mergers pursuant to globalization and digitalization of businesses and free flows of capital and labor supporting enterprise. However, outbound mergers are generally less attractive as they are time consuming and tax neutrality is not available as in the case of inbound mergers. Inbound mergers are tax neutral i.e., not subjected to capital gains tax under Section 47. Similar tax neutrality should be extended to outbound mergers as well to provide impetus to outbound mergers.

The above reforms/ clarifications should boost investor confidence by making India as a preferred investment destination hub, considering most overseas countries are keen on evaluating and following China plus one strategy which should in turn foster economic growth and ensure fiscal sustainability for India.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: 50% of last-drawn salary as pension for govt employees? Will Budget settle OPS Vs NPS debate?,"Union Budget 2024: For years, central government employees who joined central services, except armed forces, before 2004 have been demanding restoration of the Old Pension Scheme (OPS), which was replaced by the National Pension System back then.

Ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25, the Modi government has received several proposals to scrap the NPS and bring back the OPS for employees of various government services.



Amid growing demands for the restoration of the OPS, the Modi government is expected to approve a proposal on guaranteed pension for central government employees, if not fully scrapping the NPS. Various media reports indicate that Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman may announce in her Budget 2024 speech a guarantee of 50% of employees’ last-drawn salary as pension under the NPS, which replaced OPS.



This move follows concerted efforts by central government employees advocating for improved pension payouts under NPS. Central trade unions had previously met with Sitharaman, urging the reinstatement of OPS.



Union Budget 2024: Will OPS Vs NPS debate continue or get settled?

Under the Old Pension Scheme, retired government employees receive a lifelong pension equivalent to 50% of their final salary, adjusted periodically based on pay commission recommendations. As a ‘defined benefit’ plan, the OPS guarantees a fixed pension amount without requiring employee contributions during their service.

In contrast, the NPS operates as a ‘defined contribution’ scheme. Central government employees contribute 10% of their basic salary, while the government adds 14%. Pensions under the NPS are contingent on the accumulated contributions and investment returns, making the pension amount variable.

7th Pay Commission: All central govt staff except armed forces are covered under NPS

All central government employees, except those in the armed forces, who joined their services after April 2004 are covered under the New Pension System (NPS), following the scrapping of the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) as part of pension reforms implemented 20 years ago. Since then, various central and state government employee unions have been demanding the restoration of the old system. Employees who joined central government services before 2004 remain under the OPS and continue to receive a guaranteed pension.

Will Modi govt restore 50% of last-drawn salary as guaranteed pension

The Centre has previously said many times that reverting to the old pension system is not an option. But reports suggest that the Modi government is trying to find a new solution and considering a guaranteed pension amounting to 50% of the last-drawn salary for central government employees under the NPS.

According to a recent report by The Times of India, the Modi government may take this step in view of payout disparities between the Old Pension Scheme and the New Pension System.

A committee led by Finance Secretary T. V. Somanathan was tasked with examining the demand for a return to the OPS and preparing a report for the government. Under the OPS, central government employees receive a lifelong pension amounting to 50% of their last-drawn salary, with adjustments based on Pay Commission recommendations.



Why are central government employees demanding OPS restoration?

Central government employees have voiced significant concerns about the NPS, citing several issues. Employee organizations argue that the existence of two pension systems has led to income disparities among retirees from the same organization with equivalent service years, creating a sense of discrimination between different groups of employees working side by side. Additionally, the NPS is criticized for reducing take-home salaries by 10%, further fueling discontent.

To pressure the government into addressing these concerns, various groups associated with central government employees have called for the restoration of the OPS. Recently, the All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF) has formally requested the government to reinstate the OPS.

financialexpress.com,Top 10 expectations of individual taxpayers which Budget 2024 needs to fulfill,"Severely impacted by soaring inflation, declining real wages, and the escalating cost of living, individual taxpayers are eagerly looking to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as the Budget 2024 is scheduled to be presented on Tuesday (July 23rd).

This being a full-fledged budget, unlike the last one, they anticipate the FM to address their concerns. Key expectations include rationalizing income tax slab rates, raising the Section 80C deduction limit, increasing the standard deduction limit, providing more tax benefits for homebuyers and investors, and making adjustments to the New Tax Regime to enhance its appeal.



Sanjiv Malhotra, Senior Advisor, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, says, “Despite the consistent demand for a decrease in personal income tax prior to each budget, I am of the opinion that the current moment is suitable to implement this change. The middle class has been significantly impacted by years of inflation, making it reasonable for them to anticipate some form of relief. The Indian economy appears to be stable, with a GDP growth rate of 7-8%. To further stimulate growth, it is essential to shift towards a consumption-driven strategy. This shift would involve restructuring tax brackets to provide individuals with greater disposable income.”





Adhil Shetty, CEO of Bankbazaar.com, has similar views. “Taxpayers eagerly await budget announcements that will increase their disposable income. This year is no different; taxpayers expect higher deductions under the old regime and hope the new regime will allow more people to retain a greater portion of their income after taxes,” he says.

Given below are a few of the main anticipations that individual taxpayers have for Budget 2024:

1. De-cluttering of Section 80C

The Income Tax Act’s Section 80C has not been reviewed since 2014, and it is now necessary to make adjustments to this important aspect of tax savings. Section 80C covers various financial obligations such as housing loan principal repayments, tax-saver fixed deposits, employees’ provident fund, children’s school fees, and life insurance premiums. To maximize benefits for taxpayers, it would be beneficial to strategically streamline Section 80C. By separating loan repayments and insurance premiums, the government can offer more focused and efficient tax incentives for investments.

2. Increase in 80C deduction limit

The revision of the Section 80C deduction limit has been a long-standing desire of individual taxpayers, in addition to the de-cluttering of Section 80C of the I-T Act. The last revision was made in 2014, increasing the limit to Rs 1.5 lakh.

According to Bankbazaar, the current 80C limit of Rs 1.5 lakh, unchanged since 2014, should be increased to at least Rs 2 lakh to account for inflation and rising expenses. This enhancement will encourage taxpayers to save more and invest in financial instruments.

3. Change in Income Tax Slabs

It is always speculative to opine on the revised income tax slabs, but tax experts feel that the basic exemption limit may increase by Rs 100,000 and similarly the successive slabs may also see Rs 100,000 – Rs 200,000 increase. These numbers may look modest but given the fiscal deficit target, the FM may have a limited bandwidth.

4. More Relief under New Tax Regime

The two parallel tax regimes are likely to stay for a while, however, the government may offer some more relief under the new regime to motivate taxpayers to move towards it.

Shetty says, “Given that most taxpayers favor the old regime despite the absence of inflation adjustment, the new tax regime will need to offer higher tax exemptions. This will enhance the appeal of the new regime.”

“Income tax relief in the hands of taxpayers may partially get offset by increased GST collections (due to increased expenditure by households). Hence its net impact may not be of a significant concern to the exchequer,” suggests Malhotra.

5. Increase in Standard Deduction

Salaried individuals no longer receive travel allowance exemption and medical reimbursement starting from the Financial Year 2018-19, as they are now eligible for standard deduction. In order to address the increasing medical and fuel expenses, it is necessary to raise the standard deduction limit from the current Rs 50,000 to Rs 100,000 per annum. This adjustment will also bring parity with those earning income from business or profession, who have the option to claim actual expenses or choose a presumptive basis of taxation based on a certain percentage of their gross income.

6. Tax Sops for Homebuyers

Homebuyers who purchase their homes through a housing loan can avail tax benefits. Section 24 of the Income Tax Act allows for a deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh on the annual interest paid on the home loan EMI, while Section 80C of the I-T Act permits a deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh for the principal amount paid. Tax experts suggest that the deduction under Section 24 should be increased to at least Rs 5 lakh, given the significant rise in home loan interest rates and housing prices. Additionally, they propose enhancing the limit for housing loan principal repayments under Section 80C or introducing a separate deduction specifically tailored for home loans.

7. Increase in 80D deduction for health insurance premium

Salaried taxpayers seek an increase in the health insurance premium deduction under section 80D from Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000 at least. This change will offer significant relief and encourage prioritizing health insurance. Similarly, the 80D deduction for health insurance premium needs to be increased to Rs 100,000 for senior citizens. This change is crucial due to the significant rise in insurance premiums post-COVID-19, ensuring that health care remains affordable for all.

8. Rationalisation of capital gains tax regime

The capital gains tax structure in India is complex, with different rates for different types of assets and varying periods of holding to qualify as long term. For example, listed equity shares require a 12-month holding period, real estate requires 24 months, and debt instruments require 36 months. While there may have been historical reasons for this complexity, it may be beneficial to consider a more uniform capital gains tax structure in line with the government’s objective of simplifying the tax system, according to KPMG in India.

9. Change in HRA tax exemption rules

The House Rent Allowance (HRA) remains a valuable exemption for individual taxpayers residing in rented accommodations, particularly in cities other than their home city. According to the exemption formula, only four cities – Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata – are eligible for a 50% salary basis exemption, while the rest of the places receive a 40% salary basis exemption. However, cities such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Gurugram and Pune have also become increasingly expensive. Therefore, there is an expectation that the HRA rules may be revised in the Union Budget 2024 to include these cities for a 50% salary basis exemption.

10. Increase in exemption limit for interest on bank deposits

Under Section 80TTA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, individuals can avail a deduction of up to Rs 10,000 on the interest earned from savings in a bank, co-operative society, or post office. However, the current Rs 10,000 exemption limit for interest on bank deposits is insufficient and should be increased to Rs 50,000 at least to better reflect the current economic environment.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/top-10-expectations-of-individual-taxpayers-which-budget-2024-needs-to-fulfill-3560566/
financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Will Modi govt expand tax benefits under Section 80EEA to give a boost to affordable housing?,"Union Budget 2024: Real estate sector stakeholders, including homebuyers in the affordable housing segment, are hoping for some major reform measures in this first budget of the Modi 3.0 regime to be presented on July 23. The affordable housing segment has been tremendously benefitted by the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana during the Modi 2.0 term. Now, there is growing expectation that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will not only reintroduce but also expand tax benefits under Section 80EEA.

How much tax deduction benefit is available under Section 80EEA?

Section 80EEA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which came into effect on April 1, 2020, provides a deduction for interest on loans taken for specific house properties. The maximum deduction under Section 80EEA is Rs 1,50,000 per financial year.

This deduction is calculated based on the interest paid on the home loan, with a maximum limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh per financial year, subject to specific conditions. It is important to note that this deduction is in addition to the deductions available under Section 24B for home loan interest payments.





Under the “Housing for All” initiative, the government extended the interest deduction for low-cost housing loans taken between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2022. This led to the introduction of Section 80EEA, effective from Assessment Year 2020-21 (Financial Year 2019-20), which provides a higher interest deduction compared to its predecessor. Previously, Section 80EE allowed a deduction of up to Rs 50,000 for first-time home-buyers on loans sanctioned between April 1, 2016, and March 31, 2017. The new provision under Section 80EEA aims to offer greater financial relief and support for affordable housing.

Ahead of the budget, the real estate sector is hopeful for reform measures that will stimulate both demand and supply.

Tax benefits on home loans for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25)

Tax benefits are one of the important considerations when planning to take a housing loan. Tax benefits on housing loans are provided under Section 24, Section 80C, and Section 80EE of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Here are tax benefits under various Sections of Income Tax Act, 1961.

Under Section 24 – Rs 2 lakh per annum

Under Section 80C – Rs 1.5 lakh per annum

Under Section 80EE – Rs 50,000

“As the Union Budget 2024 approaches, home buyers across India are eagerly anticipating meaningful reforms to make property ownership more accessible and affordable. The real estate sector has demonstrated resilience and significant growth potential, especially in the affordable housing segment, driven by initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. We expect the government to reintroduce and expand tax benefits under Section 80EEA, potentially extending the loan sanctioning qualification period to March 31, 2026,” says Ashwin Sheth, Chairman and Managing Director of Ashwin Sheth Group.

“This extension would enable more individuals to benefit from the affordable housing scheme, promoting property ownership and providing substantial tax advantages. The real estate industry is on the cusp of growth and with the right policy support, we can create a more dynamic and inclusive housing market. As we await the budget presentation on July 23, we remain hopeful for measures that will boost both demand and supply while fostering sustainable and positive development in the sector,” he added.



Highlighting that the first Budget of the Narendra Modi 3.0 government will also include a long-term blueprint for making India a developed nation by 2047, an Assocham-Primus paper listed areas that would require the government’s greater attention and priorities for realising the national goals.

While the Budget would attend to the immediate requirements of boosting consumption, investment and augmenting the supply side of the economy, it is also expected to lay a roadmap for the bigger goal of scaling up national income to a level of developed nations,” said Assocham President Sanjay Nayar.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-will-modi-govt-expand-tax-benefits-under-section-80eea-to-give-a-boost-to-affordable-housing-3561017/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: FMCG sector bets on steps to boost rural consumption, grants and more","In the run-up to the Union Budget, the FMCG industry is anticipating announcements and incentives that would boost the rural economy and drive consumption in these areas. India’s FMCG and consumer industry’s growth, for several quarters, remained elusive on rising input costs impacting margins, and inflation that has resulted in low consumer spending from the rural and middle class consumers. Even as the last week of June showed sales volume growth for FMCG firms, there are concerns if this recovery is sustainable or just a blip. With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman all set to table the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, FMCG industry voiced its demands and are hopeful that the government will provide income tax relief to the salaried class in order to boost consumption, address the current inverted tax structure within the GST framework, allocate grants to the FMCG industry, among other reform policies that would boost the growth of the sector.

Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO, Marico Limited, said, “Ahead of this year’s Union Budget, we anticipate policies aimed at fostering inclusive and sustainable development. Key expectations include a continued emphasis on rural development through investments in infrastructure and employment, bolstering agricultural activities to enhance rural income. Tax relief for middle-class and salaried classes will not only enhance purchasing power but will also serve as a catalyst in increasing consumption patterns. The government’s support during the critical monsoon period is crucial for stabilizing rural economies and ensuring farmers have access to essential resources.”



Per data by NielsenIQ, rural consumption declined for at least six quarters since 2021, with only a slight positive turn in the first quarter of 2023. Namit Puri, Managing Director & Senior Partner, BCG, “The Union Budget 2024 is anticipated to introduce significant changes in taxation structure. Taxation changes aimed to simulate consumption are likely to also give a boost to volume growth which has been below potential. Continued investments in physical and digital infrastructure would help in bringing greater efficiency and expansion of the consumption opportunities. A push towards unlocking rural consumption, physical infrastructure and addressing farmer earnings, would really benefit the consumer sector.”



Mayank Shah, Vice President, Parle Products, said, “We are expecting the Budget to focus on rural infrastructure and agriculture related sectors, which would help in revival of the rural economy. We saw that rural consumption was impacted last year; though it is getting revived, this will help further accelerate the revival of rural demand. That will also generate employment in rural India. Also, higher allocation to rural initiatives like NREGA will also go a long way in helping the revival of rural demand. On the urban front, initiatives for job creation will be helpful which would help drive consumption of consumer products. Government needs to take steps that could help put more money in the hands of the consumers. This can be done by lowering the tax rate or increasing the income tax slabs which would result in adding more money in the hands of rural consumers.”

Besides rural consumption, the FMCG sector also advocated for measures centered on addressing immediate economic challenges while fostering long-term growth. Manish Aggarwal, Director, Bikano, Bikanervala Foods Pvt Ltd, said, “We anticipate proactive measures to control inflation, stimulate overall consumption, create rural jobs, and incentivize capital expenditure, innovation, research, and development. Recognizing the critical role of rural economies, we emphasize the need for schemes to boost rural consumption, aiming for a more stable market in 2024.”

He also said that the government needs to introduce policies to protect oilseed farmers and the oleochemical industry. Additionally, the government should also emphasise on capital expenditure and private-sector manufacturing and services to support income generation and economic activity.

Furthermore, the industry also talked about the need for more grants to support the FMCG sector. Shammi Agarwal, Director, Pansari Group, said, “We expect the government to allocate more grants to support the FMCG industry. This financial support can boost innovation, support the start-up ecosystem, and promote research and development (R&D) within the FMCG sector.” In the 2024 Interim budget, the government’s emphasis on achieving Atmanirbharta for oilseeds, including sesame, sunflower, and mustard showed their commitment to pushing the agriculture sector towards growth. This, he added, ensured food security and also opened avenues for sustainable farming practices that benefited both farmers and consumers. “Apart from this, we hope that the government will review and rationalise export and import duties on food items. Reducing these duties can enhance the competitiveness of Indian products in global markets and ensure affordability for consumers domestically,” he said.

The FMCG sector is also looking forward to initiatives encouraging private sector investments in infrastructure, which will not only create jobs but also boost productivity. Per industry leaders, digital adoption and entrepreneurship are poised to drive job creation and economic growth, supported by policies that promote innovation and efficiency. “We are optimistic that Budget 2024-25 will set the stage for a resilient economic recovery, empowering businesses, and will contribute to India’s growth trajectory,” said Saugata Gupta.

Here is more on what the industry leaders and experts are saying and expecting from the Union Budget:

Sunil Agarwal, Co-founder and Chairman, Joy Personal Care (RSH Global)

Key expectations include a reduction in income tax slabs to boost consumer purchasing power, improved access to credit for businesses, and significant GST reforms to lower costs on branded food products. The FMCG sector’s remarkable adaptability to changing consumer behavior has been evident for years. While the upcoming budget is expected to prioritize education, employment, and healthcare, it is essential for other industries to receive a boost as well. Maintaining fiscal responsibility is crucial in this uncertain global environment, but addressing high GST rates on essential FMCG products and enhancing infrastructure development will be vital for long-term growth. Looking ahead, increased government spending and consumer-centric policies like tax reduction offer a promising path for market revival.

Anubhav Agarwal, MD and CEO, BN Group

With a growing economy, strong investor sentiment and consistent increase in consumer spending, the FMCG industry is poised to grow significantly. We expect new regulations that successfully address issues faced by rural communities while protecting the interests of oilseed producers and the oleochemical sector. Furthermore, we anticipate the government will address the gap between MSP of crops and prices for final processed, as it will further boost the growth and development of the sector.

Akash Agrawal, Co-Founder, Zoff Foods

We urge the government to address the current inverted tax structure within the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework. This structure impacts food manufacturers, hindering their ability to claim the full Input Tax Credit (ITC) due to higher tax rate paid for services and other items as compared to lower tax rate of raw materials. The tax rate on basic raw material procurement and final product is 5 per cent, which makes a significant ITC blockage for manufacturers, leading to an average cash flow deficit of 10-15 per cent. This ultimately translates to reduced investments in production capacity, innovation, and job creation.

Nikhil Sethi, Partner and National Head, Consumer Goods, KPMG in India

The FMCG sector has been constrained for some time now due to low consumption growth and many external factors including elections, increasing commodity prices and tougher regulations. A budget that can help the sector should include initiatives that:

Provide stimulus to the currently constrained consumption: Accomplishable by increasing tax benefits, allowances and exemptions for individuals and allocating a higher budget for the NREGA scheme.

Incentivize manufacturing investments for new capacities and innovation: Extending the PLI scheme to include FMCG and consumer goods sectors, aiming to increase domestic production. Offering substantial financial incentives to organizations that invest in innovation, research, technology development, local sourcing, and sustainable practices that contribute to the betterment of the environment and society will not only boost manufacturing but also enhance global competitiveness, employment creation and consumer trust.

Phase regulatory compliances to synchronize investments required with sales, for instance, that on packaging or formulations.

Incentivize the ability to export to meet global standards, manufacture value added products, build scale, and so on. Introducing comprehensive tax benefits and simplify export procedures can double FMCG exports by 2026.

Allocate budget or give subsidies for strengthening value chains across agricultural and dairy sectors by adopting technology/artificial intelligence, automation in food processing infrastructure, waste reduction and crop insurance.

Atul Garg, Managing Director, GRM Overseas Limited

We hope that the budget will include measures to create buffer stocks of essential food grains like rice and wheat to address any shortfall in production and also to avoid export restrictions.

Strengthening access to credit for long-term loans is essential to enhance growth, productivity, and farm income in the agri- commodity sector. Additionally, minimizing wastage by augmenting storage capacities and upgrading warehouses is crucial. Infrastructure still continues to be a challenge and its pan-India development is a critical driver of agricultural growth. Building rural infrastructure, including roads, bridges, storage facilities, cold chains, and veterinary services, can significantly reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access for farmers in remote areas. These measures will lead to increased participation of India in global agriculture and food exports.

We recommend enhancing the budget allocation for the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) to boost farm exports. Establishing district export hubs are essential steps toward achieving these goals.

Siddhartha Nangia, Co-Founder, Smytten

As we anticipate the Union Budget 2024, the FMCG sector is looking for policies that will stimulate both rural and urban demand. Initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency, reduce operational costs, and support digital transformation will be pivotal. We also hope for incentives to promote sustainable packaging and eco-friendly practices, aligning with the global shift towards sustainability. Enhanced investment in infrastructure, particularly in logistics and transportation, will be critical for improving market access and reducing costs. Furthermore, supportive policies for startups and MSMEs can boost entrepreneurial initiatives within the sector.

Priyanka Duggal, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat

The consumer industry is hopeful for rationalisation of the provisions of accelerated tax incentives for employment generation, simplified tax structures as well as adding incentives for the startups looking at reverse flip to Indian holding companies, retail-centric initiatives for digitisation simplifying the equalisation levy, TDS and TCS provisions. From a direct tax perspective, the interim Budget 2024 seems to have missed extending the concessional tax rate of 15 per cent for new manufacturing companies. Reflecting at the importance and impending growth of the sector, a clear ask from the Budget will be to reinstate the same. With technology and AI becoming critical for retail and ecommerce companies, the need of the hour is promoting digitisation for businesses and introducing accelerated tax breaks on digitisation expenditures.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-fmcg-sector-bets-on-steps-to-boost-rural-consumption-grants-and-more-3559923/

He noted the absence of any mention from the TDP on the issue. JD(U), a significant NDA ally, had recently passed a resolution urging for special status or an alternative package for Bihar.

In a post on X, Ramesh, who was present at the meeting said, “In today’s all-party meeting of floor leaders chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, the JD(U) leader demanded special category status of Bihar. The YSRCP leader demanded special category status for Andhra Pradesh. Strangely, the TDP leader kept quiet on the matter.”



Demands for special category status in Andhra Pradesh have resurfaced following the Lok Sabha elections.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024 expectations: Building resilience for consumer industry,"By- Naveen Malpani

The Indian retail industry is currently experiencing significant transformations driven by several key factors, including omnichannel push, technological advancements, sustainability, etc. These changes are reshaping how businesses operate and interact with consumers.

To fully leverage this potential, the industry must focus on several strategic areas, such as enhancing supply chain efficiency through advanced analytics and AI. This may significantly reduce costs and improve service levels. Investing in omnichannel strategies that seamlessly integrate online and offline experiences will be key to capturing the diverse Indian consumer base. Additionally, prioritising data security and privacy will be crucial as digital transactions and data exchanges increase in the country.



Furthermore, fostering innovation through incentives for startups and tech adoption can drive the next wave of growth. Government policies that support infrastructure development, especially in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, can unlock new markets and consumer segments. Finally, sustainability initiatives, such as incentives for green practices and sustainable packaging, can position the industry as a leader in responsible consumption, aligning with global trends and consumer expectations of least damage to the environment.

However, navigating challenges, such as regulatory complexities and economic fluctuations require resilience and strategic adaptation. This year’s budget is expected to address critical areas, such as enhancing consumer purchasing power, improving supply chain infrastructure, and fostering a competitive business environment.

The industry seeks measures that leverage tax collections (including rationalising GST rates, streamlining tax compliance) in order to provide necessary support, along with incentives for digital adoption and sustainable practices, and measures to bolster domestic manufacturing. The retail and e-commerce sectors are hopeful that the Union Budget 2024 will strike a balance between fiscal responsibility, combating inflation and propelling industry growth.

Here are some key areas to look out for:

Building digital infrastructure: With the rapid digitisation of the consumer market, there is an expectation for significant investment in digital infrastructure. This includes enhancing internet connectivity, promoting digital literacy, and strengthening cybersecurity measures. Offering tax breaks on investments made in adoption of AI, ML, and blockchain, could significantly drive technological advancement.

Extension of incentives for the manufacturing sector: To further promote manufacturing, the government may consider extending concessional tax rate of 15% for new manufacturing companies introduced in October 2019, by one year, from March 2024 to March 2025. This would encourage continued growth and investment in the sector.

Opportunities to boost Rural consumption: The Industry has been struggling with stagnant volume growth for last couple of quarters. Incentives like relaxation in direct tax rates, investment in rural infrastructure, favorable minimum support price for agriculture output can boost disposable income in the hands of the consumer. This can effectively help in improving the disposable income in the hands of the consumer and thereby boost consumption.

Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme: The PLI scheme has significantly impacted various sectors in India. Its further extension to the leather, toys, textile and footwear industry will create more jobs and increase manufacturing. Recently, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry decided to reopen the application window for PLI scheme for White goods (ACs and LED lights) for 90 days driven by increased industry interest.

Fostering global investments in retail: As global MNCs explore expansion in India, it is essential for tax and regulatory laws to be strategically aligned. This would facilitate smoother entry and growth for these companies, thereby contributing to India’s economic development by providing regulatory clarity and tax incentives.

Providing upliftment to D2C set up: The D2C landscape faces significant challenges related to compliance complexities, including GST, TDS, and Angel Tax. Simplifying these processes would ease operational burdens for startups and MSMEs. To incentivise innovation, tax reliefs, employment-focused deductions, and subsidies, are anticipated. Furthermore, government initiatives supporting funding, loans, and digitisation can spur growth and sustainability in the sector.

Rationalisation of Basic Customs Duties: To support the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative and stimulate domestic manufacturing, stakeholders advocate for the rationalisation of basic customs duties on key imports, such as components for high-end mobile phones and consumer durables. This is crucial for keeping the sector competitive.

Rationalisation of provisions relating to deduction and collection of taxes on sale of goods: As of now, the Government has mandated both buyer and seller to either deduct tax or collect tax respectively upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Fixing the obligation on any one of the parties will reduce compliance burden and enhance ease of doing business for companies operating in the consumer industry.

Financing Options for Retailers: Programs like the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana could be further promoted to provide financial support to small-scale kirana and brick-and-mortar stores, ensuring their continued relevance and growth.

As the Union Budget 2024 approaches, anticipation is palpable across the nation. The annual budget is not merely a financial document but a blueprint of India’s aspirations and priorities. Over the past almost eight decades, India’s journey has been marked by steadfast devotion to democracy, integrity, and sustainable growth. Despite encountering challenges, the country has continually evolved, embodying resilience and unwavering pursuit of progress. This narrative is both commendable and a source of national pride.

The forthcoming budget is expected to be no different in its significance. It will, by default, reflect the myriad factors that have shaped India’s impressive economic narrative. This narrative is built upon the nation’s collective sensibilities, transcending political, historical, and geopolitical challenges.



In a democracy like India, the collective strength of individuals fosters a belief system that prioritizes the sense of nation’s building. This collective dynamism is evident in the country’s thriving economy as well, significantly bolstered by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). These enterprises, collectively, make the backbone of the Indian economy, driving future growth and innovation.

Given their crucial role, it is imperative that the upcoming budget prioritises MSMEs. Adequate support and favorable policies for MSMEs are essential for India to aim to sustain a CAGR of 8-9% and achieve its ambitious goal of becoming a $10 trillion economy.



Ensuring that MSMEs receive the attention and resources they deserve is critical for India’s sustained progress. As we await the Union Budget 2024, it is essential to recognize that India’s economic success is built on the collaborative efforts of countless individuals and enterprises. Their collective strength has forged a resilient and dynamic economy that is rightly a source of national pride.

Furthermore, the Union Budget should continue to serve as a strategic vision statement that unites all stakeholders—Government, Corporations, MSMEs, and Citizens—in the collective endeavour of nation-building. Each stakeholder, through focused efforts, contributes to lighting the path forward. This unifying vision can catalyse innovative solutions and collaborations, fostering unprecedented growth.

In essence, the upcoming Union Budget is not just a fiscal statement; it is a reflection of a nation’s collective strength, aspirations, and achievements. As India stands on the brink of becoming a global economic powerhouse, it is timely to acknowledge the journey thus far and look forward to the promising future that lies ahead.

Undoubtedly, the Union Budget holds unparalleled significance in actualizing India’s ambition of becoming a preeminent global power. Its role is not just to allocate funds, but to strategically address and rectify the nation’s enduring economic and civic challenges. In an era of transformation, the budget must act as a catalyst for growth, rather than an impediment to the nation’s progress.

A well-articulated vision within the budget can unify diverse stakeholders in unprecedented ways, sparking innovative solutions and collaborative efforts. Thus, the Union Budget must serve as an annual manifesto, reaffirming a shared vision that mobilizes corporations, MSMEs, the government, and citizens alike. Each stakeholder, by actively participating, contributes to illuminating the collective path forward, steering India towards a prosperous and sustainable future.

financialexpress.com,What India’s leading developers expect from Budget 2024,"India’s economy has displayed impressive resilience and sustained strong macroeconomic health despite global economic challenges. As India prepares for the Union Budget 2024, the real estate sector, which has experienced robust growth and demand recovery post-pandemic, is anticipated to receive a boost to further drive its expansion.

The government’s steadfast dedication to the ‘Housing for All’ initiative underscores the necessity for substantial fiscal backing to accomplish its goals. “With indications of controlled inflation, promising growth prospects, and the anticipation of a favorable monsoon, there is ample room for growth. The eagerly-anticipated Union Budget, which outlines the government’s financial strategy, is eagerly awaited by both the industry and individuals. The real estate sector is hopeful for specific announcements that could benefit homebuyers and the industry,” says Dr. Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head – Research and REIS, India, JLL.





Here we take a look at India’s leading property developers’ key expectations from the Budget 2024:

Kalyan Chakrabarti, CEO, Emaar India: “As we await the upcoming union budget, we are optimistic that it shall be akin to the interim budget auguring growth and development. We continue to seek an industry status for the real estate sector, which would represent a significant stride on the infrastructure front by the government. This move would enable developers to lower borrowing costs and pass on the benefits to the customers. As key stakeholders in the sector, one of our primary expectations is a reduction on GST rates on construction materials to enhance affordability and make home-buying more accessible. We expect policies that will promote financial inclusivity and incentivisation, such as reforms in taxation and financial accessibility. Additionally, optimising the process of land acquisition and registration of properties to make it more transparent and efficient, further encouraging development and investment in the sector. We are hopeful that the budget will positively contribute to the real estate sector’s mission of inclusive growth, sustainable development, and job creation in the coming years.”

Naveen Gadde, MD, Navanaami: “The real estate sector faces significant challenges due to the rising costs of land and construction materials. These escalating expenses have made it difficult for developers to maintain the feasibility of launching new projects, which has contributed to shooting the cost of property for the middle class. We hope that the home loan rate of interests will be reduced to push demand and make good properties available for the real estate sector. The government can also grant stamp duty concessions. We hope the budget will introduce fiscal incentives and policy reforms that will help stimulate demand and ease liquidity constraints. Such measures are crucial for enabling developers to continue providing affordable housing options to a broader segment of the population. By addressing these challenges, the government can ensure the growth of the real estate sector and make homeownership more accessible to many aspiring homeowners. Additionally, we expect initiatives that promote sustainable development and enhance the overall ease of doing business in this sector.”

Rishi Raj, COO, Max Estates: “While the implementation of RERA has brought much-needed transparency and accountability to the real estate sector, developers believe that granting industry status to real estate could further catalyze growth and investment. There is a pressing need to simplify procedures and foster innovation within the sector. We are hopeful that the upcoming budget will address these needs by introducing policies that promote sustainable practices and encourage the use of advanced technologies in construction and project management. Such initiatives will not only enhance efficiency but also ensure the long-term growth and modernization of the real estate industry. Additionally, with respect to GST, allowing for Input Tax Credit for built to lease commercial real estate projects is not only consistent with core principles of GST but also will further aid development of Grade A+ commercial developments critical to further strengthen India’s position as hub for global services (e.g., Global Capability Centres). By addressing these critical issues, the government can create a more supportive environment for real estate development, benefiting both developers and homebuyers in the Delhi NCR region and beyond.”

Anuj Munot, CEO & Founder, UrbanWrk: “The Indian real estate sector has shown strong performance in recent quarters, making the 2024 Union Budget a crucial moment for the industry. Anticipated reforms are expected to streamline processes, boost transparency, and drive growth. With NITI Aayog projecting the sector’s market size to hit $1 trillion by 2030, it is imperative for the government to address key issues such as high input costs for materials like steel and cement. Lowering the 28% GST on cement and granting real estate industry status can reduce construction expenses and facilitate developers in accessing loans at lower interest rates. Moreover, the implementation of a single-window clearance system will expedite project approvals, creating a more efficient and investor-friendly environment. These initiatives will not only stimulate growth but also significantly contribute to the country’s GDP, increasing the sector’s share from 8% to 13% by 2025.”

Ashok Singh Jaunapuria, MD and CEO of SS Group: “We are eagerly awaiting the Union Budget 2024, hoping for tax reforms, increased incentives for affordable housing, greater investment in urban infrastructure, and more efficient regulatory procedures. These measures will boost the growth of the real estate sector, making homeownership more accessible and sustainable. It is recommended that the government raise the interest deduction limit to promote homeownership. By improving tax benefits, potential homebuyers will be more motivated to invest in real estate, enhancing their financial security and stimulating market expansion. Higher deductions on home loan interest could make owning a home more financially feasible for many, potentially leading to a surge in demand for residential properties. Furthermore, increased investment in urban infrastructure can enhance connectivity and quality of life, making urban areas more appealing to residents and investors. Streamlined regulatory processes will assist developers in completing projects more efficiently, reducing costs and delays.”

Manas Mehrotra, Founder, 315Work Avenue: “The country is seeing a new office culture given the change in work patterns across the world and new preferences of the workforce. Understandably, the coworking industry has become more relevant than ever with the demand surging significantly in the recent times owing to its affordable pricing options and flexible work culture. Large enterprises too have shifted gears to coworking space as they embraced the hybrid work model to suit their organizational requirements. India continues to be the fastest growing flex office market in the APAC region and is set to account for one-fifth of the office market by 2030. Taking into consideration the popularity of hybrid working, we have a few expectations around GST and taxation from the upcoming Union Budget that can further accelerate growth of this sector.

In recent years, the entrepreneurial landscape has undergone a significant change and coworking spaces have emerged as a transformative force in India’s startup ecosystem. Some of the measures that we could look forward to include lower GST rate for small-scale coworking clients. This will significantly help the coworking industry boost their footprints by attracting small start-ups to be part of the industry as well as increase the revenue collection to the government. The salary upper limit of 25k could be enhanced to 40k and timeline from 3 yrs to 5 yrs to enable start-ups/coworking entities to enjoy the benefit of sec 80JJAA as these industries are generating a greater volume of employment. Input tax credit under GST is an important issue that concerns coworking sector. We expect the budget would enable coworking firms to claim input credit on work contract and construction services supplied so that it is passed on to companies who lease out space for coworking and thereby reduce their overall costs.”

Ramani Sastri, Chairman & MD, Sterling Developers: “The real estate sector plays a pivotal role in the economy, contributing significantly to employment and GDP. Hence, the upcoming budget should introduce measures that will bolster this economic context. The Indian real estate sector continues to scale new heights in 2024 driven by positive market sentiments. economic expansion, urbanization, evolving lifestyles, rising disposable incomes, better employment opportunities, increased business activity and government policies amongst others. The desire for homeownership remains undeterred among consumers, as residential sales continue to breach previous highs. This year, the demands go beyond the usual expectation of single-window clearance and industry status, which could unlock financial advantages and streamline project approvals. There is an express need for more tax sops for both homebuyers as well as investors. The government should raise the deduction limit for interest payment on home loans from the existing Rs 2 lakh a year to Rs 5 lakh, which will add momentum to housing demand, reduce GST on under-construction properties and effect adjustments in raw material pricing. For a large section of the population, affordability remains the biggest challenge and hence there should also be expansion in the definition of affordable housing as this would expand the benefits for homebuyers and hence boost the end-user demand. Any tax exemption from rental income will also encourage greater investment in residential real estate.”

Dinesh Gupta, Secretary, CREDAI Western UP: “Boosting the real estate sector with tax incentives, improved tax structures, and a single-window clearance policy will encourage further investment in the real estate sector from both domestic and foreign sources. Furthermore, tax reforms that lower income taxes for both corporations and individuals, simplify tax legislation, offer targeted incentives, expand the SWAMIH stress fund, and lower the GST rates on building materials will boost the building industry and improve the situation for real estate players. The combined effect of the aforementioned reforms will raise the amount of money accessible to taxpayers, enabling them to buy real estate more enthusiastically and ultimately speed up the nation’s economic growth.”

Sarthi Goel, CEO of Civitech Group: “The real estate industry expects a number of significant changes to promote efficiency and growth. Real estate will attract investors and simplify rules if it is given industrial status. Simplifying the clearance process with a single window can speed up project approvals, cut down on delays, and improve project execution in general. Moreover, higher house loan interest rate deductions are essential for expanding access to luxury properties, which would boost demand and foster a healthy market environment. These programs not only help the industry reach its growth goals, but they also significantly improve the state of the economy as a whole by creating jobs and stimulating infrastructural development.”

Himanshu Garg, Director, RG Group: “To improve housing accessibility, tax slabs should be raised and limit of affordable housing should be revised. Industry experts are in favour of raising the housing affordability cap in metro areas, especially in the MMR and NCR regions, from ₹45 lakhs to ₹75 lakhs. As a basic need of person and safe investment, home loan rates should be low and the limit of the Credit-Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) can also be increased. Aside from that, simplifying GST is essential to lower expenses and improve affordability for homebuyers. Additionally, easing FDI regulations will draw in international capital, promoting growth and innovation in the luxury market.”

Bhavesh Kothari, Founder & CEO, Property First: “We are optimistic and expect the upcoming budget to bring in massive transformations. We urge the Finance Minister to implement tax reliefs in terms of reduction in GST rate along with an input tax credit on under-construction properties. Besides, anticipation is high that home mortgage rates will drop considerably to pave the way for renewed growth. Granting industry status to the sector would be another significant step that would catalyse growth and contribute to the nation’s economy. Also, we expect the government to continue focusing on more infrastructure development in highways, metro lines, planned satellite cities, etc as it will help drive housing demand across the country.”

Madhusudan G, CMD, Sumadhura Group: “We expect the Union Budget 2024-25 to introduce progressive reforms to meet the rising demand for residential and commercial spaces. Our top priorities include tax breaks for affordable housing projects to boost stagnant sales in the sector. Also, a revival of the Credit-Linked Subsidy Scheme will make homeownership more accessible. We also expect tax incentives and infrastructure enhancements to boost urban living standards and drive growth in emerging areas. Simultaneously, we expect the government to grant industry status to real estate, a long-standing demand that could drive fresh investment and growth.”

Pyush Lohia, Director, Lohia Worldspace: “We are hopeful that the upcoming budget will bring significant changes. We are particularly looking for increased investment in infrastructure and meaningful tax reforms. Easing tax provisions on housing would be a significant step, making homes more affordable and driving demand. The deduction limit on interest paid on home loans needs to be raised from the current cap of Rs 2 lakh per annum. These measures would turn out critical not just for the sector but for broader economic growth, job creation, and supporting small businesses. A balanced approach will pave the way for sustainable development.”

Anantharam Varayur, Co-founder of Manasum Senior Living Homes: “With the number of elderly people rapidly growing, the senior living industry is set for major growth. Projections show that the proportion of elderly individuals aged 60 and above is expected to reach 19.5% by 2050. Currently, India has 150 million elderly people, which is expected to reach 230 million in the next 10-12 years. However, the penetration rate of senior living properties is only 1% in India with only 18,000 units across the country, compared to 6% in the US and 11% in the UK. There is ample scope to meet the supply gap and the ever-increasing demand. There is a need to look at providing subsidies or tax deductions for low- and middle-income seniors in order to increase affordability of these housing units. Further, on the income tax front, senior citizens should be given some relief at this later stage of their life, given that they have been responsible citizens and paid taxes throughout their lives. Among other reliefs, the budget should provide relaxation on services and purchases in real estate. Additionally, infrastructure development in Tier-II and Tier-III cities is key for the sector.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/what-indias-leading-developers-expect-from-budget-2024-3559865/
financialexpress.com,"Railway Budget 2024 Prediction: Indian Railways likely to see big budgetary boost of Rs 2-2.25 lakh crore, says report","In a groundbreaking prediction report released by Jarvis, an AI-enabled Market Intelligence & Equity Market Analytics Platform, significant insights into the upcoming Railway Budget allocations have been unveiled. According to the report, the government is likely to allocate Rs 2 lakh crore to Rs 2.25 lakh crore for the development of Indian Railways. This substantial allocation aims to bolster infrastructure, enhance connectivity, and modernise services across the railway network, addressing long-standing issues and meeting growing passenger and freight demands.



Key Challenges

However, the report also underscores key challenges that could impede these ambitious allocations. Funding constraints to pose a significant hurdle, requiring innovative mechanisms and increased private sector participation

Funding constraints continue to pose a significant hurdle, so there is a need for innovative financing mechanisms and increased participation from the private sector. Project execution remains another critical area. We need better ways to manage them and watch progress closely.



Using new technologies like artificial intelligence, IoT, and automation is also important. They can make things work better, safer, and help us use resources wisely in these areas. Apart from enhancing efficiency, these are also crucial for ensuring sustainability across Railways.

As stakeholders await the Union Budget announcement, scheduled for July 23, all eyes are on how these predictions will translate into actionable policies and initiatives that propel India towards its developmental goals in the coming fiscal year and beyond.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/railway-budget-2024-prediction-indian-railways-likely-to-see-big-budgetary-boost-of-rs-2-2-25-lakh-crore-says-report-3559820/
financialexpress.com,"Railway Budget 2024 Expectations: Will Modi 3.0 revolutionise passenger experience, development of railway stations?","Railway Budget 2024-25: This is the first railway budget under Modi 3.0 and going by the momentum set by previous budgets, expectations are high this year as the Centre is expected to reinforce driving transformative growth over the next five years. With a keen focus on passenger comfort and convenience, modernizing stations, improving connectivity, and upgrading train services are paramount. Moreover, addressing last-mile connectivity for freight and logistics is anticipated to boost revenues significantly amidst a growing industrial sector.

Improving passenger experience

“Today, passengers in India are well-acquainted with global trends in convenience and comfort. It is imperative to capitalise on this by improving passenger experiences, which not only enhances satisfaction but also boosts revenue

significantly. Efforts should focus on modernising railway stations, increasing connectivity, and upgrading train services to align with international standards,” says Harsh Varshneya, principal architect at STHAPATI.



Increasing Passenger Traffic

If the railway budget 2024 focuses on improving passenger experience, it is bound to increase passenger traffic as well. As Varshneya puts it, “Drawing people to railways in major parts of the country is a challenge. With the growing aviation sector, efforts will need to be made to ensure that railways can still attract passengers by improving the infrastructure of railway stations, providing faster connectivity, and providing better train services that are in line with global standards.”



Freight and Logistics

With a major thrust on the industrial sector and more international houses setting up bases in India, freight and logistics is also one sector in which we can expect railways to resolve the last-mile problem. If they do, it will surely increase revenues drastically.

Transportation Hubs/Multi-Modal Hubs

Budget announcements are critically important for transportation hubs in Indian Railways as they dictate funding allocations and strategic priorities for infrastructure development, modernisation, and service enhancement.



Mitu Mathur, Director, GPM Architects and Planners says, “Developing railway stations as multimodal hubs will enhance the overall quality of urban infrastructure by reducing distances and travel time, leading to economic revitalisation and social upliftment channels.”

She further adds that Development of railway stations should be considered as channels of economic revitalisation and social upliftment as they generate more employment opportunities and unlock the real estate opportunities of otherwise under-utilised land parcels.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/railway-budget-2024-expectations-will-modi-3-0-revolutionise-passenger-experience-development-of-railway-stations-3559734/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: How to make the New Tax Regime more attractive,"The Budget 2024 is right around the corner, and every taxpayer is waiting with bated breath to see how it will affect his wallet. The budget not only sets the economic tone for the country but also profoundly impacts individual finances. This article explores ways the government could make the new tax regime more attractive for taxpayers.

What is the new tax regime?

The Finance Act 2020 inserted Section 115BAC, with effect from the assessment year 2021-22, to provide for an alternative regime providing for lower tax rates for individuals and Hindu undivided families (HUF). However, an assessee has to forego various exemptions and deductions to claim the benefit of reduced tax rates under this regime. Last year, the Finance Act 2023 extended the scope of this regime to AOP, BOI, and AJP and made it a default tax regime.

Why are taxpayers not switching to the new tax regime?

The new tax regime was designed to simplify tax computation. It came with lower tax rates and new tax slabs but required taxpayers to give up many popular deductions and exemptions. These deductions include premiums paid towards life insurance, home loan principal/interest payments, health insurance premiums and many more.



Although the new tax regime offers lower tax rates, many people found it less beneficial due to the loss of deductions. Thus, despite its higher tax rates, the old tax regime remained popular because it ultimately resulted in a lower tax liability for small taxpayers compared to the new regime. Where an individual is eligible to claim deductions under Section 80C, Section 80D and interest on a housing loan under Section 24(b), the old tax regime is always beneficial for him. Where there is no housing loan but one pays rent, no exemption is allowed under Section 10(13A) for the HRA under the new tax regime. This makes the new tax regime unattractive for many salaried individuals who migrate to metro cities for employment.



How to make the new tax regime popular?

Introduce deductions

In India, a significant proportion of home purchases are financed through home loans. While exact numbers fluctuate yearly, estimates suggest that around 70-80% of home buyers in urban areas rely on home loans to finance their new houses. A taxpayer with a home loan can avail deductions under Sections 80C and 24(b) for principal repayment and interest payments, leading to substantial tax savings.

Further, considering the high cost of medical treatment, medical insurance is a must-buy for every taxpayer. The deduction of medical insurance premiums is available under Section 80D. Similarly, almost every salaried employee gets from tax savings through the House Rent Allowance (HRA). The new tax regime does not allow these deductions. Therefore, taxpayers cannot simply switch to the new regime without first calculating their tax liability under the old regime.

Accordingly, introducing some common deductions can significantly increase the appeal of the new tax regime. Allowing deductions for HRA, home loan repayment, and medical insurance would make the new tax regime more attractive.

Beyond incorporating existing deductions, the finance minister should introduce new deductions specific to the new tax regime. These could be tailored to modern financial needs and expenses, providing further incentives for taxpayers to transition from the old tax regime to the new tax regime.

Change in tax slab

A tax slab refers to an income range that attracts a specific tax rate. Under income tax, individual taxpayers are subject to varying tax rates based on their income levels.

The existing basic exemption limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh in the old tax regime has remained unchanged since the Budget 2015. Further, individuals are taxed at a rate of 30% on income exceeding Rs. 10 lakh. Despite hyperinflation, the government still needs to revise these thresholds. It is unlikely that the government will change the tax slabs and rates under the old tax regime because its primary goal is to encourage people to switch to the new tax regime. Therefore, modifying the old tax regime would hinder the government’s objective.

However, changes in slabs or tax rates are possible under the new tax regime. Presently, the basic exemption limit in the new tax regime stands at Rs. 3 lakh, with the highest tax rate of 30% applicable on income exceeding Rs. 15 lakh. Therefore, tax slabs or rate changes under the new tax regime may encourage greater taxpayer participation.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: 9 facts to know ahead of FM Sitharaman’s speech,"Union Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is poised to make history by delivering her seventh consecutive Budget on Tuesday (July 23) for the fiscal year 2024-25, surpassing former Prime Minister Morarji Desai’s record. Appointed as India’s first full-time woman finance minister in 2019, she has presented six budgets to date, including an interim one earlier in February 1. The upcoming full Union Budget marks her seventh straight, exceeding Desai’s record of five consecutive full budgets and one interim budget from 1959 to 1964.

Here’s a list of 9 facts about India’s Budget presentation:

–First Budget of Independent India: India’s inaugural Union Budget post-independence was presented on November 26, 1947, by RK Shanmukham Chetty, marking a historic fiscal milestone.

–Most Budgets Presented: Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai holds the record for presenting the most budgets among Indian finance ministers. He served under Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri and presented a total of 10 budgets during his tenure.



Desai’s budgetary legacy began with his first budget on February 28, 1959. Over the years, he presented full budgets consecutively for the next two years. In 1962, he presented an interim budget, followed by two more full budgets. After a gap of four years, Desai presented another interim budget in 1967. Subsequently, he presented three full budgets in consecutive years from 1967 to 1969, completing a total of 10 budgets during his distinguished tenure as Finance Minister.

–Second Highest Number of Budgets: Congress leader P Chidambaram, former Finance Minister, presented budgets on nine occasions. His stints included terms -under the United Front government led by HD Deve Gowda and later during the Congress-led UPA regime.



–Third Highest Number of Budgets: Congress leader and former President Pranab Mukherjee presented eight budgets, spanning from the early 1980s to 2012, prominently during his role in the UPA government, contributing significantly to India’s economic policies.

–Manmohan Singh’s Contributions: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh presented five consecutive budgets between 1991 and 1995, during his tenure as Finance Minister under P V Narasimha Rao’s government, pivotal for India’s economic reforms.

–Longest Budget Speech: Nirmala Sitharaman delivered the longest budget speech on February 1, 2020, lasting two hours and 40 minutes, underlining comprehensive fiscal policies and reforms.

–Shortest Budget Speech: Hirubhai Mulljibhai Patel’s interim Budget speech in 1977 remains the shortest, succinctly delivered in just 800 words.

–Historical Timing Shift: Traditionally, the Budget was presented on the final day of February at 5 pm, a practice dating back to colonial times when announcements synchronized with London’s time zone. India, being 4 hours and 30 minutes ahead of British Summer Time, ensured the Budget was delivered during daylight hours in the UK. In 1999, Finance Minister Yashwant Singh of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government changed the timing to 11 am. Since then, Budget presentations have consistently occurred at this earlier hour.

–Date Change: In 2017, the Budget presentation date was moved to February 1st to expedite the Parliamentary approval process, ensuring completion by the end of March. This adjustment enabled the Budget’s implementation to commence from April 1st, the start of the fiscal year. Previously, presenting the Budget on February 29th necessitated a delay in implementation until May or June, factoring in the 2-3 months required for parliamentary approval.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-9-key-facts-to-know-ahead-of-fm-sitharamans-speech-3559900/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Banking sector hopes for policy continuity; announcements on FDI, divestment, cyber security measures and more","As we are closing in on the date of the Union Budget presentation, the banking sector is betting on policy continuity on infrastructure spend. The industry leaders and experts said that the Budget should announce policy changes and incentives that help move towards growth, bring financial stability, and support digitalisation. Yashraj Erande, India Leader, Financial Services, BCG, said, “For India to become a $7 trillion economy, the financial services and fintech sector has a crucial multiplier role to play. We expect the pace of reforms to accelerate with the upcoming budget. The focus of the reforms has to be on creating more large scale balance sheets, infusing digital and AI in the financial services operating model to drive efficiency, with exceptional focus on governance and risk. Driving better partnerships between fintechs and unlocking more pools of domestic and global capital to fund these balance sheets plus technology will be crucial.”

Prashant Kumar, MD & CEO, YES Bank, said, “The government is expected to remain committed to the reforms process and be focused on eight key areas: sustainable growth, financial sector, infrastructure and investment, women, youth & farmers, last-mile connectivity, inclusive development, and economic expansion – all essential towards achieving ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. At YES BANK, we are prepared to support the government’s push for enhancing digital infrastructure and promoting financial inclusion. This aligns with our commitment to bringing advanced banking services to underserved regions and supporting initiatives in green mobility, affordable housing, healthcare, and education. These efforts will not only spur economic growth but also ensure holistic development.”



The industry experts also recommended that the government should increase foreign direct investment (FDI) to boost capital in the sector. Vivek Iyer, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat, said, “Given that India is a banking led economy, initiatives around liberalisation of foreign direct investment, rationalisation of foreign bank tax rates amongst others will help boost capital flows in the country, which will further accelerate the goals towards Amrit Kaal that the government set out for India.” Currently, 49 per cent of FDI in the banking sector is allowed under the automatic route and beyond that, government approval is required for private banks. In public sector banks, up to 20 per cent of FDI is allowed.



Many also talked about taking actions towards divestment in banks and insurance. Per experts, privatisation of certain institutions could help bring in more investment and thereby strengthen the financial system. Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, said, “There is a wish for a reduction in government presence, particularly in the banking and insurance sectors. While divestment has been discussed over the years, there has been limited progress towards achieving this. Now is the right time for the government to consider divestment in banks and insurance to help supercharge the credit growth required for an above 8 per cent growth rate.”

Further, with the rise in the number of frauds in the banking sector, the industry also expects the government to announce common policies and measures that will augment enterprise resilience and cyber security. According to the RBI annual report released on May 30, as many as 36,075 frauds were reported in banks in FY24, growing by nearly 166 per cent as against the 13,564 cases reported during FY23. Mahesh Ramamoorthy, Chief Information Officer, YES Bank, said, “Establishing a continuum of cybersecurity measures is essential to improving an organisation’s security posture. Investments in advanced threat intelligence and robust encryption will protect our digital assets and build user trust. Additionally, improving data privacy and governance will ensure compliance with global standards and safeguard user information.”

Further, V Balasubramanian, CEO, Financial Software and Systems, said that the government should also look at charging digital payments like UPI. He said, “The government should look at charging digital payments like UPI which will allow banks to build robust payment infrastructure and security standards enabling fast, simple and secure payments while protecting the end consumers against frauds and cyber security threats. Apart from this, the government should also focus on building a payment platform on cloud for banks. This is where cloud technology can play a major role in empowering banks to be more agile, cost-effective and collaborative in their endeavours to make digital payments safe and secure.”

Here is what’s more on the wishlist of the banking sector for the Union Budget, to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23…

Anish Mashruwala, Partner, JSA Advocates and Solicitors

Given the continuity of the NDA government coming out of the recent elections, the safest bet for the banking sector is the continuity of the policy on infrastructure spend. Any additional spend there has a direct fillip to lending in the banking sector, with cascading effects in the industry supply chain verticals. Accordingly, the banking sector will hope that the growth decade of India continues with heavy infra spend. One other area that I believe the banking sector will look to is some guidance and guardrail policies around prolific digitisation. With the challenge of rising frauds in the industry and the onset of generative artificial intelligence, the banking sector, while already gearing up for that, would be looking for common policies establishing acceptable standards. Towards that, if the government could assist in sops on the spends to establish robust departments within the banks, it will incentivise the sector to embrace the challenges quicker.

The upcoming Union Budget presents an opportunity to boost the growth of India’s MSME sector. Measures like Production-Linked Incentives, Export promotion, Digital India campaign, simplification of tax structure and Skill development will bolster the global competitiveness of MSMEs. We are optimistic about the continued thrust on digital adoption, financial inclusion, green policies, market access and concerted efforts to foster entrepreneurship. These will help integrate MSMEs deeper into global value chains while incubating new ideas and sparking innovation. We hope to see measures that will augment enterprise resilience and cyber security, considering emerging external risks.

Banking requires dynamic and timely reforms for countries like India. FDI in banking should be increased to invite more capital; government participation in public sector banks should be reduced asap; incentives to individuals on tax applied on fixed deposits should be given to increase liability business and to create level playing field with the stock market and create balance; big incentives should be given to private sector especially SME on Capital Expenses for capacity building and increase employment and also to reduce dependency on government spending; focused reform and incentives be given on long term lending by banks on identified infrastructure projects; tax concessions should be given to private sector availing Green Finance to set up greenfield and brownfield Green Projects.

Protections should be given to decision makers in the banking sector where loans go bad or lead to fraud where decision is taken in the normal course and committee-based approach. Fear of penalty and prosecution need to be balanced for the banking industry to apply themselves.

The newly appointed government will be expected to continue with policy focus on prudent fiscal management and fiscal glide path to achieve a fiscal deficit of 4.5 per cent by FY 26. This augurs well for overall macro-stability for transitioning towards the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047. I believe the Union Government budget should focus on five key priorities for the upcoming Union Budget

– Commitment towards fiscal discipline needs to get reiterated and will boost India’s fiscal image at a time of global bond inclusion.

– Viksit Bharat requires scaling up of financial intermediation in a sustainable manner. There is an urgent need to accelerate deposit mobilization by the banking system. The FY25 Union Budget (along with support from the RBI) could look at providing a level playing field to bank deposits vis-à-vis other competing instruments by incentivizing deposit mobilization through lowering tax incidence on FDs.

– With the government’s focus on digitization and financialization of the economy and boosting cyber security, the Indian banking system needs to meaningfully scale up the technological infrastructure to be future ready. FY25 Union Budget could offer some tax rebates for scaling up technological infrastructure.

– The Union Budget needs to be multi-dimensional prioritising filling of government jobs, existing PLI Scheme to reinvigorate labour intensive sectors like textiles, leather, tourism, etc, doubling increasing allocation towards education from close to 3 per cent currently of GDP to around 6 per cent.

– The Budget could consider increasing targeted allocation for affordable housing under the PMAY Scheme while also providing tax incentives to home loan borrowers for developers. Scaling up of agriculture infrastructure and encouraging ‘farm tourism’ will also provide a strong impetus to rural incomes.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-banking-sector-hopes-for-policy-continuity-announcements-on-fdi-divestment-cyber-security-measures-and-more-3560060/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: Consumer durable industry calls for 5-12% GST cut,"The consumer durables sector outlines important expectations for policy considerations as the budget draws near. The industry is pushing for a 5 or 12 per cent GST cut on both entry-level and luxury appliances in order to increase affordability and spur growth for all income brackets. In order to strengthen local manufacturing and create jobs, tax reductions for raw materials, components, and machinery improvements are emphasised, along with the necessity of continued support for the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) plan and the Made in India initiative.



In fact, the Union Budget of 2024 plays a crucial role in keeping India as the world’s third-largest economy. With India contributing $3.7 trillion to the global economy and having the largest population of young people, there is a lot of untapped potential.

Let’s have a look at what the industry specialist foresee:

As per Kamal Nandi, Business Head and Executive Vice President of Godrej Appliances, the durables industry will gain from measures that reduce input costs, encourage technological innovation towards building energy-efficient products and lower taxation to induce appliance adoption and penetration in the country. “With temperatures rising above 50°C in many cities, ACs are certainly becoming a necessity. GST reduction will make ACs more affordable to masses and improve the quality of life for many more Indians. We also need to recognise the environmental impact of appliances and recommend addressing it with lower tax rates for consumers to switch to 5-star rated products,” Nandi added.

“Encouraging the use of automation is seen as pivotal for reducing costs and improving competitiveness in the business environment. Addressing human capital needs, there is an emphasis on skill development initiatives and industry-academia partnerships to upskill the workforce. Additionally, the industry advocates for regulatory streamlining to lower transaction costs and enhance the ease of doing business. Lastly, there is a plea for tax incentives promoting sustainable practices, aligning with global environmental goals and making sustainability a competitive advantage,” Mahesh Gupta, Chairman of Kent RO Systems stated.



For Avneet Singh Marwah, CEO, Super Plastronics Pvt Ltd, Exclusive Brand Licensee of Blaupunkt TVs in India, there is a need to focus on strategies that encourage spending and investment in order to boost the economy and tackle the rising inflation. “Keeping the 15% corporate tax rate for new manufacturing ventures would attract both local and international businesses to set up shop in India. One expected move is reducing the GST rate on LED TVs larger than 32 inches from 28% to 18%. Another proposal is to review income tax slabs to increase disposable income for taxpayers as it would likely lead to higher spending and boost consumption across various sectors,” Marwah explained.

“As we look ahead to the upcoming Union Budget 2024, we are highly optimistic about its transformative potential for the consumer durables sector. We eagerly expect the new government to bring in policies that support research and development, enhance infrastructure, and promote sustainable practices,” Harshit Aggarwal, CEO and Founder Novamax Appliances said.

Interestingly, Arjun Bajaj, Director of Videotex believes that the Indian government should prioritise comprehensive support for the local manufacturing of electronics, including the television industry. “While mobile phone manufacturing has benefited from numerous incentives, the TV manufacturing sector, despite contributing nearly USD 12 billion to the economy, has faced neglect. Furthermore, the industry is heavily reliant on imports for critical components like semiconductors and display fabs, predominantly sourced from China and Taiwan. This dependence exposes the industry to price volatility and supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical tensions. While the government has initiated efforts to establish semiconductor manufacturing in India, it is crucial to expedite these projects and also focus on developing domestic display manufacturing capabilities. This would reduce dependency on imports, stabilise the supply chain, and strengthen the overall electronics manufacturing ecosystem in India,” Bajaj shared.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-consumer-durable-industry-calls-for-5-12-gst-cut-3560049/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Focus of Budget likely on affordable housing, infrastructure, says ASSOCHAM","The upcoming Union Budget is anticipated to place a strong emphasis on manufacturing, affordable housing, green mobility and comprehensive infrastructure development in addition to increasing demand for consumption, according to a study published by Assocham and Primus.

“While the Budget would attend to the immediate requirements of boosting consumption, investment and augmenting the supply side of the economy, it is also expected to lay a roadmap for the bigger goal of scaling up national income to a level of developed nations,” said Assocham President Sanjay Nayar.

The document outlined areas that would demand the government’s greater focus and priorities for attaining the national goals, emphasising that the first Budget of the Narendra Modi 3.0 government will also feature a long-term vision for making India a developed nation by 2047. Nayar further said the government has the fiscal space to spend on capex but recycling the funds from monetisable operating assets would be strategically a better strategy to manage it even better.



Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on Tuesday in Parliament.

As per the Assocham-Primus study, green fuel will increasingly power India’s economy. The change in direction is accelerating at several levels. It also anticipates the introduction of PMAY 2.0, which will include elements like Beneficiary Led Construction (BLC) and Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) to customise housing options to the financial capacity of significant portions of the populace.

“India Inc is expecting a major thrust in the forthcoming Budget on consumer demand, especially among the middle-class people, while reforms-friendly policies will continue more vigorously with several investment-oriented and Ease of Doing Business measures,” Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood stated.

In order to lower post-harvest losses and guarantee greater price realisation for farmers, the report also emphasised the necessity of a national agriculture infrastructure mission with an emphasis on enhancing logistics including cold storage, processing facilities and packaging facilities.

Nilaya Varma, co-founder and CEO, Primus Partners said to achieve the vision of Viksit Bharat, the government needs to prioritise and enable a shift from agriculture to manufacturing to provide a pathway for employment. “Support for core engineering-led manufacturing (that would provide jobs), supporting clusters for strengthening MSMEs and supporting or creating new clusters like EV, electronics and aircraft manufacturing is critical. This needs to be done while advancing towards net-zero energy,” he said.

Moreover, the study suggests that promoting climate-resilient and sustainable agriculture will assist India achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2070 and serve as a roadmap for decarbonisation in agriculture over the next ten years.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: What is the difference between Economic Survey and Budget? Explained,"The Economic Survey and the Budget are two critical documents in India’s fiscal policy landscape, each serving distinct yet complementary roles in shaping the country’s economic strategy and priorities.

Understanding Economic Survey

Imagine the economic survey as a detailed report card on the country’s financial performance over the past year. Prepared by the Chief Economic Advisor, it dives deep into key economic indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, inflation rates, and the performance of various sectors like agriculture, industry, and services. The survey also analyzes the government’s fiscal deficit, which tells us the gap between its income and spending. Here are key aspects of the Economic Survey:

-Analysis of Economic Performance: It offers a comprehensive review of the economic performance, covering aspects like GDP growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, external sector developments, employment trends, and sectoral performance.



-Policy Recommendations: The Survey provides policy recommendations based on economic analysis. These recommendations often include reforms needed to address current economic challenges and enhance long-term growth prospects.

-Data-driven Insights: It includes detailed data, charts, and graphs to illustrate economic trends and projections, making it a valuable resource for policymakers, economists, and analysts.

-Medium to Long-term Outlook: While it provides insights into the current economic situation, its focus extends to medium to long-term economic outlook and potential challenges.

-Global and Domestic Context: It contextualizes India’s economic performance within the global economic environment and discusses implications of global trends on domestic policies.



Union Budget:

The Union Budget, presented annually by the Finance Minister, outlines the government’s revenue and expenditure plans for the upcoming fiscal year. Here are its primary features:

-Revenue and Expenditure Allocation: It details the government’s projected revenue from various sources (taxes, borrowings, etc.) and allocates funds across sectors and schemes.

-Policy Initiatives: The Budget introduces new policy measures, tax proposals, and reforms aimed at achieving economic growth, promoting social welfare, and addressing fiscal challenges.

-Sectoral Allocations: It specifies budgetary allocations for key sectors like agriculture, education, healthcare, infrastructure, defense, etc., reflecting government priorities.

-Fiscal Deficit and Debt Management: It includes projections of fiscal deficit (the difference between government’s total revenue and expenditure) and outlines strategies for managing public debt.

-Public Finance Transparency: The Budget enhances transparency in public finance by detailing how taxpayers’ money will be utilized, ensuring accountability.

Key Differences:

-Timing and Scope: The Economic Survey precedes the Budget and provides a comprehensive analysis of economic trends and challenges, whereas the Budget outlines financial allocations and policy measures for the upcoming fiscal year.

-Nature of Content: The Economic Survey focuses on economic analysis, trends, and recommendations, while the Budget emphasizes fiscal allocations, revenue generation, and expenditure planning.

-Audience: The Economic Survey is primarily for economists, researchers, and analysts interested in economic trends, while the Budget targets a broader audience including taxpayers, businesses, and investors affected by fiscal policies.

In short, while the Economic Survey offers a diagnosis and prescription for the economy’s health and future direction, the Union Budget translates these insights into concrete fiscal policies and allocations, playing a pivotal role in India’s economic governance and development strategy.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-what-is-the-difference-between-economic-survey-and-budget-explained-3559465/

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectation: PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana – Explained,"The programme, PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, launched on February 15, 2024 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is actually a government scheme which aims to provide free electricity to households in India. As per the data, the households under this scheme will be provided with a subsidy to provide solar panels at their rooftop, however, the subsidy will only cover up to 40 per cent cost of solar panel installation.

Notedly, the scheme is expected to provide its benefits to 1 crore households across the country. Additionally, with the implementation of this scheme, it is anticipated that the government will save about Rs 75,000 crore per year in electricity loss.

With the upcoming Union Budget 2024, the industry experts expect that it will set a roadmap to achieve the goals of Surya Ghar Scheme in states including Uttar Pradesh and Assam, which are already boosting such efforts with additional subsidies. Furthermore, it is anticipated that there will be an increased number of solar panels installed through awareness campaigns. “We may see investments in local partnerships with urban and rural bodies and digital resource building. The budget may propose initiatives for microinverter technologies, which offer advantages in safety, scalability and monitoring capabilities. This approach allows homeowners to start with smaller installations and expand over time. Concurrently, the government may invest in a centralised dashboard to monitor solar performance and usage at local levels, facilitating better management and optimisation of solar systems nationwide,” Manoj Gopalan Nair, Sr. Director, Sales-India, Enphase Energy stated.



What are the benefits of the scheme?

As announced by the government of India, the scheme will provide benefits of free electricity for households, reduced electricity costs for the government, increased cost of renewable energy and reduced carbon emissions.

Additionally, a subsidy of Rs 30,000 to 60,000 will be provided to the households with an average electricity consumption of up to 150 units. For this, the solar plant installation will have the capacity of 1-2 kW. For households with an average electricity consumption of 150 to 300 units, Rs 60,00o to 78,000 will be provided for the installation of solar panels between 2-3 kW. Similarly, households with over 300 units of monthly electricity consumption will be provided with an installation capacity of above 3 kW while the subsidy amount would remain Rs 78,000.

Anyone who is an Indian citizen or has a house with a roof that is suitable for solar panel installation can apply for this scheme. In addition to this, households must have a valid electricity connection and should not have availed any other subsidy for solar panel installation.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectation-pm-surya-ghar-muft-bijli-yojana-explained-3559510/
financialexpress.com,Student Loan Woes and Taxes: Can the Budget 2024 offer financial relief?,"Education is the premise of progress in every society, in every family. Obtaining best quality higher education is increasingly becoming a top priority for both children and parents across the globe. Having said that, the cost of higher education has increased significantly in recent years, making it difficult for many families to afford them. This has indeed led to a rise in the number of students/parents opting for education loans to fund their higher education in India or outside India. In addition to the tuition fees, education loans help cover other ever-increasing costs such as accommodation, travel for education, books and other essentials.

While education loan helps in bridging the gap between aspiration and affordability, it can pose several practical challenges and woes for students and their families. Some common issues faced by applicants include stringent eligibility criteria, collateral requirements, high interest rates, limited loan amounts, documentation hassles, repayment terms, preference for specified courses and institutions, credit history requirements and change in government regulations. Navigating these challenges requires thorough research, financial planning and proactive communication with lenders, to arrive at an informed decision.





Despite the practical challenges and difficulties associated with obtaining an education loan, one silver lining in the cloud is the tax relief provided under Section 80E of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The interest portion of the EMI paid on education loans availed from specified institutions for the purpose of pursuing higher education, qualify for deduction under Section 80E of the Income-tax Act. Some important aspects to claim deduction are provided below:

Eligibility: Available only to an individual who has taken loan for the higher education of self, spouse, children or for a student for whom the individual is a legal guardian.

Available only to an individual who has taken loan for the higher education of self, spouse, children or for a student for whom the individual is a legal guardian. Lending institution: Loan availed only from a financial institution, or an approved charitable institution qualify for deduction.

Loan availed only from a financial institution, or an approved charitable institution qualify for deduction. Duration: Deduction available for a maximum of 8 consecutive tax years, starting from the year in which repayment of loan begins.

Deduction available for a maximum of 8 consecutive tax years, starting from the year in which repayment of loan begins. Purpose: For pursuing higher education in India as well as outside India

For pursuing higher education in India as well as outside India Maximum amount of deduction: Unlike some other deductions which have a capped limit, there is no upper limit on the amount of interest that can be claimed as a deduction, making it particularly beneficial for borrowers with high loan amounts and significant interest payments.

Unlike some other deductions which have a capped limit, there is no upper limit on the amount of interest that can be claimed as a deduction, making it particularly beneficial for borrowers with high loan amounts and significant interest payments. Tax Regime: Available only to the individuals opting for old tax regime.

Another essential factor associated with education loans is Tax Collected at Source (‘TCS’). TCS is applied by the Indian government to track the money being sent out of India under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (‘LRS’). It is the tax to be paid when money is being sent overseas for education. Now such TCS is bifurcated and classified, as detailed in the following sentences. There is no TCS for the first INR 7 lakh remitted for education purposes. The moment the remittance (including living expenses such as food, clothing, tickets etc. for the student) goes beyond INR 7 lakhs, a TCS of 5% is applied. However, if the remittance is financed by a loan, a TCS rate of 0.5% is applicable. For any overseas remittance being made for reasons other than above, the TCS rate goes up to 20% which is a substantial number.

Having said this, credit of TCS can be claimed at the time of filing the Income-tax return, making it only a temporary cash flow factor rather than a sunk cost.

In the Interim Budget 2024, the Finance Minister made the highest ever allocation for the department of school education and literacy. Now with the full Union Budget 2024 around the corner, one may expect some relief related towards interest rates on higher education loans considering it will significantly impact the affordability of education for Indian students and their families. However, any relief towards TCS on remittances for overseas education is highly unlikely. So, guardians need to be prepared for an impact on the overall funds flow with some relief available for loan deduction and delayed refund of TCS funds.

financialexpress.com,What India’s salaried class hopes for in the Budget 2024?,"Budget Day in India is typically filled with a whirlwind of emotions such as anxiety, surprise, nervousness and so on. Different stakeholders have different expectations from the Budget. For the salaried class the expectations revolve around tax relief – deductions/exemptions, better rate of returns and measures that can reduce prices of commodities.

It is important to note that there were no major announcements in the interim budget of February 2024 as it was only a vote on account. Therefore, all eyes and ears will be on the Union Budget 2024 scheduled for July 22. Some key expectations of the salaried taxpayers are mentioned below.

1. Increase in basic exemption limit

During Budget 2020, the government announced the introduction of a new simplified tax regime (which is now the default tax regime) and increased the basic exemption limit gradually. This regime benefits taxpayers who do not currently claim deductions for investments. Consequently, they are not obligated to submit investment documentation to their employers as well. It is also an agreed position that a substantial share of a salaried taxpayer’s income is incurred in expenses such as housing loan repayments, life and health insurance premiums, etc. When it comes to the old regime, the last revision was done in FY 2014-15, marking a decade since the last revision. While incomes of salaried taxpayers has risen over the decade, the basic exemption limit has remained at the same level. Hence, it may be reasonable to expect the limit to be revised to INR 5 lakhs for both the tax regimes.





2. Increase in 80C limit

While recent policy changes suggest a shift towards the new tax regime, a majority of salaried taxpayers have investments qualifying for deductions and hence prefer the old tax regime. Similar to the change to the basic exemption limit, the last increase to the 80C deduction under the old tax regime happened in FY 2014-2015. Over the past decade, cost of living has increased causing a strain on the common man’s wallet. Even with the hike in salary, this section remains committed to investing in avenues such as LIC, Provident Fund contributions, Equity Linked Savings Scheme, Public Provident Fund, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, National Savings Certificate, Fixed Deposits etc., amidst inflationary pressures. In light of the above changes, a revision in the 80C deduction limit from INR 1.5 lakhs to INR 2 lakhs would be well received by salaried taxpayers.

3. Standard deduction

Budget 2018 witnessed a change in the tax landscape where transport allowance and medical reimbursement were replaced with a standard deduction of INR 40,000. This meant that the salaried taxpayer need not produce any bills (required for medical reimbursement) and was eligible for a blanket deduction. The limit of standard deduction was further increased to INR 50,000 in Budget 2019. This was subsequently extended to taxpayers opting for the new tax regime in last year’s budget. While this has been welcomed by salaried taxpayers, there is also the expectation for a further increase in the limit to INR 1 lakh for new tax regime users and INR 70,000 for old tax regime users.

4. Capital gains tax

For a salaried taxpayer, any decrease in capital gains tax wouldn’t necessarily translate to immediate savings. It is irrefutable that a substantial segment of our nation’s population, actively engages in the securities market. Previously, the sale of long-term capital gains from listed equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds was exempt from taxation. However, Budget 2018 introduced the tax regime for such capital gains exceeding INR 1 lakh. The past few years have been characterized by a robust growth in the stock market leading to a substantial increase in many stocks and investment units. Hence, increasing the threshold limit for capital gains tax from INR 1 lakh to INR 2 lakhs, would help maintain the tax in line with the market growth and reduce the tax burden of such investors.

5. Interest paid on housing loan

Owning a house is the dream and aspiration of every person and salaried taxpayers are no exception. To achieve this goal, many have secured, or will likely secure, financing through bank loans. However, it is important to acknowledge that not only have property values increased over the years, interest rates too have risen on such loans. Given the front-loaded nature of many loan structures, interest payments incurred during the initial years may be subject to a higher effective interest rate. As a result, the total interest paid during this period could surpass the limit allowable under the Act. It is pertinent to note that the maximum interest that could be claimed was last increased from INR 1.5 lakhs to INR 2 lakhs during the FY 2014-15. Hence, raising this limit to INR 4 – 5 lakhs (considering the current market situation) could help taxpayer in reducing their tax outflow. While the above would only benefit taxpayers opting for old tax regime, taxpayers who have opted for the new tax regime expect the deduction should also be offered to them as well, since the interest paid on housing loans represents a significant financial burden for most taxpayers, regardless of the chosen tax regime.

6 Procedural alignment of AIS before filing tax return

Parallel to Form 26AS, the Income tax Department rolled out the Annual Information Statement (AIS) during 2021. The AIS is a comprehensive statement which includes additional information related to interest, dividends, securities, transactions, mutual fund transactions, foreign remittance information, advance tax / self-assessment tax etc. Due to its reliance on information provided by third parties and their e-TDS filings, the AIS update process may not guarantee complete data accuracy by the tax return filing deadline. Therefore, a system is needed to ensure streamlined data is available by May 31st, allowing taxpayers to file returns with complete information.

Having said all of that, one fervently hopes the above expectations of the salaried taxpayer will be considered by the government. Even if only a select few of these expectations are addressed in the upcoming budget, it would serve to enhance the morale and financial well-being of salaried taxpayers and potentially lead to a sense of optimism regarding the following year’s fiscal budget.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Study calls for ‘urgent’ need to double agriculture R&D budget – What will be its impact?,"There is an urgent need to double the current budgetary allocation for agricultural research and development to enhance its impact, the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) stated in a quarterly bulletin released ahead of the upcoming Union Budget 2024. The bulletin further indicated that to accomplish this goal, the budget for agricultural research and development expenditure (ARDE) needs to be almost doubled from the current Rs 9,941 crore allocated to the Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE) within the next 2-3 years.

High ROI in agri research

The bulletin underscored that previous studies have demonstrated the high return on investment in agricultural research. Each rupee invested yields a return of 11.2, significantly higher than investments in fertilizer subsidies (0.88), power subsidies (0.79), education (0.97), or roads (1.10). “Therefore, reallocating funds from fertilizer and power subsidies to agricultural R&D could significantly enhance food and nutritional security amid climate change challenges,” the bulletin, edited by agricultural economist Ashok Gulati, said.

The report also stresses the importance of translating research into practical applications. Since 2014, under the aegis of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the National Agricultural Research System has released 2,380 varieties of various field crops, with 1,971 being climate-resilient.



Despite these efforts, the agricultural GDP growth has been adversely affected by extreme weather events like the El Nino in 2013, which reduced agri-GDP growth to 1.4% in FY24 from 4.7% in FY23. “We need some satisfactory answers to this. One plausible answer is that whatever has been done so far is not enough to protect Indian agriculture from extreme weather events. Or, there is a serious lack of extension-related activities that may have aided in research moving from lab to land,” the report said.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-study-calls-for-urgent-need-to-double-agriculture-rampd-budget-what-will-be-its-impact-3559515/
financialexpress.com,7 things Union Budget 2024 can do for salaried taxpayers,"With the upcoming presentation of the Union Budget 2024 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23rd, the salaried class is eagerly anticipating favorable announcements. This includes tax reductions and reforms aimed at simplifying and streamlining taxation processes.

Salaried taxpayers are hopeful for lower income tax rates to alleviate the impact of inflation and rising interest rates. Additionally, they are looking forward to incentives that promote equity investments, such as tax exemptions, leading to higher disposable income. The expectation also extends to the introduction of a more straightforward tax structure and expanded tax exemptions in the budget.

A few expectations of the salaried class from the Union Budget 2024 are outlined below:



1. Rationalization of slab rates

Numerous people anticipate that the government will adjust the income tax slab rates to create a more progressive and fair system. This adjustment has the potential to lower taxes for the middle-income bracket. Additionally, the current maximum surcharge rate in the new tax regime stands at 25%, while in the old tax regime, it is 37%. The benefits offered in the new tax system could possibly be expanded to the old tax system as well.



2. Increase in 80C deduction limit

The government should consider increasing the deduction limit under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act to offer assistance to middle-class taxpayers. Given that the deduction amount was last modified in FY2014-15, remaining at Rs 1.5 lakh for an extended period, an adjustment upwards is well overdue. The deduction is widely considered the most crucial tax benefit for individual taxpayers in the previous tax system. Given the rising cost of living, raising the deduction limit to a minimum of Rs 2 lakh from the current Rs 1.5 lakh would offer significant relief to the majority of salaried individuals.

3. Rationalization of New Tax Regime

It is important to consider extending the deductions available to individuals under the older tax regime, such as health insurance and NPS contributions, to the new tax regime. This will help promote equal access to healthcare and incentivize savings and investments for taxpayers.

Moreover, “an increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in the new tax regime could provide a much-needed impetus to domestic savings,” says Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India.

4. Increase in Standard Deduction limit

The only deduction salaried taxpayers get is a standard deduction of Rs 50,000. Considering the rate of inflation and this limit being fixed for the past many years now, it is a popular expectation to increase the same to at least Rs 1 lakh.

5. Change in House Rent Allowance (HRA) tax exemption rules

HRA continues to be an exemption useful for the salaried class staying on rent specially in cities which is not their home city. “As per the formula for claiming such exemption, only four cities i.e., Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, are eligible for exemption basis 50% of salary. Rest of the places get the exemption basis 40% of salary only. In today’s times cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Gurgaon, Pune etc. have also equally become expensive. Hence, the expectation that HRA rules may be updated in Budget 2024 to include these cities for HRA exemption basis 50% of salary,” suggests Sirwalla.



6. Inclusion of interest on different kinds of bank deposits u/s 80TTA

Salaried individuals often distribute their money across various savings and term deposit accounts in order to maximize their returns. As such, it may be beneficial for the government to consider including interest earned on different types of bank deposits, such as fixed deposits, under section 80TTA. Additionally, raising the threshold for this inclusion from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 could be a favorable decision.

7. Boost to housing

With the aim of achieving housing for all, there is a widespread anticipation that the government might introduce certain tax incentives for housing and reduce funding costs for middle and low-income individuals. Under the current default tax system, interest on housing loans is not deductible for self-occupied properties. In contrast, the previous tax system allows a deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh only. This differentiation is significant as purchasing a home and obtaining a loan for self-occupation are major financial commitments that often last for extended periods. Given the recent increases in interest rates and regulatory changes, the real estate sector is facing growing challenges. To address these issues and promote homeownership, it is recommended that the government reconsider allowing deductions for interest on self-occupied housing loans even under the new default tax system or increase the deduction in the old tax system to at least Rs 3 lakh, according to KPMG in India.

Thus, there are expectations galore from the upcoming Budget 2024. However, whether this time the salaried class is able to get something from the government or not remains to be seen!",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/7-things-union-budget-2024-can-do-for-salaried-taxpayers-3558169/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Real estate looks for much-needed impetus for long-term growth,"The upcoming presentation of the Union Budget 2024-25 on July 23rd has sparked optimism within the real estate sector regarding the Modi 3.0 regime. Anticipation is mounting for potential tax reliefs and other measures to boost market sentiment. The future of the industry hinges on unimpeded infrastructure development to enhance urban living standards and foster the growth of new areas.

Will the government accede to the longstanding request for industry status for the entire housing sector? Will it implement effective measures to revitalize the affordable housing segment, which has been in decline since the onset of the pandemic? Industry experts continue to ponder over these questions.

“The real estate market in India has shown strong performance in 2024 so far, as evidenced by the increasing number of housing sales and new projects in the top 7 cities. Sales have hit a record high of approximately 493,000 units in the fiscal year 2023-2024, while 447,000 units were launched. It is crucial for this positive trend to be sustained in the coming years, especially since the current growth pattern is more focused on mid-range and luxury housing. In order to address the housing needs of lower-income groups in India, there must be a concerted effort to promote affordable housing alongside the high-end market segment,” says Anuj Puri, Chairman, ANAROCK Group.





Numerous incentives that used to be available to buyers and developers of affordable housing have lapsed within the past two years. So, it is crucial to rejuvenate this significant sector through impactful actions such as providing tax incentives to developers to encourage their focus on affordable housing, as well as offering tax breaks to buyers to enhance affordability.

The industry expects a strong focus on infrastructure and innovation to tackle the housing shortage in both rural and urban areas, especially through programs aimed at improving rental housing.

“Potential tax relief, such as changes to income tax exemption limits in the new tax system, could greatly benefit low-income earners. Adjustments to income tax brackets for individuals earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh annually are expected to increase spending power and stimulate economic activity, which is crucial for the middle class. We also predict further support for the affordable housing sector through reinstated PMAY incentives, while GST reforms will be essential for ensuring nationwide accessibility. The budget is likely to maintain its focus on sustainable development and green innovation, promoting environmentally-friendly practices in infrastructure projects,” says Arvind Nandan, Managing Director – Research & Consulting, Savills India.

Looking ahead to the forthcoming budget for 2024-25, there is a clear opportunity to reshape the trajectory of India’s real estate sector.

“An important aspect is the necessity for increased tax benefits for homebuyers and investors. We call upon the government to contemplate raising the deduction limit for interest on home loans from the current Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh annually, a move that could significantly enhance housing demand. Furthermore, reducing the GST on under-construction properties and adjusting raw material prices would serve to further stimulate the market. These adjustments are not only crucial for revitalizing the sector but also for boosting demand in around 250 associated industries,” says Mohit Goel, Managing Director, Omaxe.

The sector also requires improved ease of doing business for developers, which would foster a more favorable investment environment. “Addressing liquidity issues, simplifying regulations, and providing increased funding for affordable and mid-income housing are vital to promoting sustainable growth. Streamlining approval processes and advancing the digitization of land records would lead to substantial reductions in project delays, benefiting both developers and end-users. On the commercial front, incentivizing green building practices and sustainable infrastructure development is imperative for driving urban renewal and attracting additional investment,” Goel adds.

Vikram Singh, President, Central Park, says, “We are optimistic to see certain positives from the upcoming budget for the luxury real estate sector. The current boom in this market reflects the increasing demand from affluent buyers who are looking for elegant residences with modern amenities and exquisite design. The sector’s upward trajectory is further amplified by the continued urbanisation and growing disposable incomes. Moreover, streamlining regulatory approvals for high-end projects would significantly enhance operational efficiency and boost investor confidence, which are both essential for sustained growth in the realty market. Overall, the real estate sector hopes the budget will promote growth, encourage investment and make home buying altogether more accessible.”

Enabling Indian investors to engage more extensively in global markets is also the need of the hour.

Ritu Kant Ojha, CEO of the Dubai-based Proact Luxury Real Estate, says, “We expect that the forthcoming Union Budget will introduce changes that will enable Indian investors to engage more extensively in global markets. The current 20% Tax Collected at Source on foreign real estate investments, as mandated by the Liberalised Remittance Scheme, limits their ability to take advantage of international opportunities. Reducing this rate to 5% would not only expand the amount of capital available but also facilitate wider portfolio diversification overseas, thereby enhancing India’s presence in international markets. These adjustments are crucial as we strive for a $5 trillion economy and endeavor to harmonize with the tax regulations of developed countries.”

The forthcoming budget has the potential to significantly impact the affordability of Indian real estate.

“With a shortage of 29 million units, 90% of which are in the affordable housing segment, we anticipate substantial measures to stimulate supply and demand. Additionally, the proposed increase of tax rebate on interest on housing loan under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act will facilitate easier access to home ownership for the middle class. Furthermore, granting industry status to the entire real estate sector, not just affordable housing, could reduce borrowing costs by 2-3 percent, potentially leading to lower home prices. Given that India’s urban population is projected to reach 600 million by 2030, the budget should establish a foundation for sustainable and affordable urban housing growth,” suggests LC Mittal, Director, Motia Group.

Gunjan Goel, Director at Goel Ganga Developments, says, “The real estate industry is currently facing a crucial moment, with the budget having the potential to greatly impact affordability. We are seeking solutions to tackle the liquidity challenges that developers are experiencing, resulting in the halt of numerous projects. The SWAMIH fund has already approved Rs 12,000 crore for 130 projects, highlighting the need for more effective mechanisms. Extending the CLSS scheme will undoubtedly boost demand for affordable housing. With recent data showing a 5% year-on-year decrease in housing sales in major cities, it is imperative to implement strong fiscal policies to rejuvenate the sector. One such policy could involve raising the price limit to ₹45 lakh for metro cities, enabling more projects to qualify for lower GST rates and additional subsidies for developers and homebuyers.”

The impact of the Budget on real estate affordability will largely depend on its effectiveness in addressing supply- and demand-side challenges.

“Streamlining approval processes and reducing the number of permits required, which currently stands at around 35, can significantly cut project timelines and costs. On the demand side, revising the cap on capital gains tax exemption for reinvestment in two houses will provide a boost, particularly for Metro markets experiencing higher prices. With the real estate sector’s contribution to GDP at 6-7%, projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, budgetary support is crucial. Additionally, the GST input tax credit for under-construction properties has the potential to lower house prices by 5-7%, making homeownership more attainable for many,” says Aman Gupta, Director, RPS Group.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-real-estate-looks-for-much-needed-impetus-for-long-term-growth-3558665/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: How year-on-year India’s GDP grew to become world’s fastest-growing economy?,"India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the fourth quarter of FY24 surged by 8.2%, amounting to Rs 47.24 lakh crore, surpassing earlier estimates by the National Statistical Office (NSO) which projected a growth of 7.3%. The nominal GDP expanded by 9.6% in FY24, compared to 14.2% in FY23, as reported by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI).

India is the fifth largest economy in the world GDP rankings list after USA, which is first, followed by China, Germany and Japan.

The Gross Value Added (GVA), which measures the value generated by various sectors of the economy, also saw robust growth, increasing by 7.2% in FY24, driven by a 9.9% growth in manufacturing and a 7.1% growth in the mining sector. Real GVA and GDP growth rates for the fourth quarter stood at 6.3% and 7.8%, respectively.





The real GDP at Constant Prices reached Rs 173.82 lakh crore in FY24, marking an 8.2% growth over FY23. Nominal GDP at Current Prices for FY24 was estimated at Rs 295.36 lakh crore, up from Rs 269.50 lakh crore in FY23, reflecting a 9.6% growth.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised India’s GDP growth forecast for FY25 to 7% in July 2024, citing improved private consumption, particularly in rural areas, as a key driver. India’s current GDP for FY24 is estimated at $3.9 trillion, with a growth rate of 8.2%, outpacing major economies like Russia, the US, China, and Japan according to IMF data.

In its latest edition of the World Economic Outlook, the IMF maintained its projection for the next financial year with a slower growth rate of 6.5 percent.

Meanwhile, ahead of the Union Budget, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has upgraded its growth forecast for the fiscal year 2024/25 to 7.2%, up from 7%, driven by a resurgence in private consumption, robust investment, and a rebound in exports.

A look at India’s GDP from 2019

What is GDP – An Explainer

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a vital measure that indicates the overall economic health and size of a country. It represents the total value of all goods and services produced within a country’s borders over a specific period, typically a year. GDP is crucial because it helps us understand the economic performance and growth trends of a nation.

For example, if India’s GDP grows by 7% in a year, it means the economy has expanded by that percentage compared to the previous year. A higher GDP growth rate often correlates with increased job opportunities, higher incomes, and improved living standards for the population.

Governments and policymakers use GDP to make decisions about economic policies, such as taxes and spending. It helps them gauge economic performance, identify areas of strength or weakness, and plan strategies for sustainable growth and development. Understanding GDP is important for students as it provides insights into how economies work, how wealth is generated and distributed, and the impact of economic policies on people’s lives.

What sectors drive India’s GDP?

India’s GDP is primarily driven by three main sectors. They are services, industry, and agriculture, which complement each other in India’s economic structure, contributing to overall growth, employment generation, and socio-economic development. While the services sector dominates in terms of GDP contribution, the industry and agriculture sectors play crucial roles in providing essential goods, infrastructure, and livelihoods across urban and rural areas of the country.

What was said about GDP in interim Budget?

In the Interim Budget presented on February 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government has estimated a nominal GDP growth rate of 10.5% in 2024-25 (i.e., real growth plus inflation).",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-how-year-on-year-indias-gdp-grew-to-become-worlds-fastest-growing-economy-3558725/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: What individual taxpayers can expect from FM Nirmala Sitharaman,"India, now the fourth largest economy in the world, is poised to grow at 6.5% during the 2025 fiscal year, backed by strong commitments in infrastructure, technology, the start-up ecosystem and a skilled talent pool, as per IMD’s World Economic Outlook of April 2024.

Healthy macro-economic factors apart, growing tax revenue is also a major driver to fuel growth. Individual taxpayers have been significant contributors to direct tax revenues. Coupled with effective administration and ease of compliance, the net tax collection from individuals is expected to exceed that of the corporates by about 21.6% during the 2024-20252 fiscal year.

The number of individuals with earnings above INR 5 lakhs per annum has surged five times since 2012. While it is evident that the personal tax base has widened, it is also true that tax slab rates have not changed in line with the aforesaid income surge. Individual taxpayers still believe that the government could offer more to stimulate investments, savings, and financial relief.



This is the ask from individual taxpayers, to bring in parity between corporate tax rates and individual tax rates, as the maximum tax rate for an Indian company with sales less than INR 400 crores is only about 25%. If the maximum marginal rate for individuals can be reduced, at par with corporates, it will enhance disposable income, thereby stimulating consumption and investments.



Procedural simplifications

Procedural compliances have eased out, eliminating the need to claim deductions in the new tax regime, thereby saving efforts and time. Certain deductions can be brought in, which do not require the need for submission of proofs, such as say, employee contribution to provident fund, PPF, that may encourage more taxpayers to move towards this regime.

Enabling tax payment through overseas bank accounts and initiating tax refunds into foreign bank accounts reported in the tax return, can further simplify the procedures especially for non-residents who have return filing obligations in India. Further, there could be options to allow e-verification of return through OTP, on overseas mobile number or email for non-residents.

Increased savings

Lowering tax rates or widening the tax slabs can increase take-home pay, encouraging individuals to invest and save better. Under the old regime, enhanced section 80C exemption limit (investment in provident fund, tuition fees, etc.), 80D4 limit (health insurance premium for self and family and expenditure towards preventive health checkup) would compensate increased costs and accommodate numerous investment options.

Enhanced section 80CCD(1B)5 limit (contribution towards national pension scheme) to INR 1 lakh would allow individuals long-term financial planning and to save better for retirement.

Additional standard deduction would alleviate the middle-class from steep tax outflow, strengthening personal financial well-being.

The increased deduction against the current INR 2 lakhs available on interest on housing loans would benefit all homebuyers, offer expanded opportunities for individuals considering residential property purchases and foster growth in the real estate sector.

Capital gains tax rates

Capital gains taxation has evolved from what used to be just two rates – one for long term capital gains and another for short term capital gains. Today we have multiple tax rates; for example, 10%, 15%, 20% and slab rates. Going back to a two-tiered structure with some rate optimization to protect revenues, will ease the compliance and procedural burden on individuals.

In his acclaimed work “Arthashastra”, medieval political strategist Chanakya advises rulers to “collect taxes from the citizens as honeybees collect nectar from flowers – gently and without inflicting pain.” Individuals hope that the upcoming Budget would provide reasonable tax changes so that the government collects right quantum of taxes in an efficient manner so that taxpayers are empowered in nation building.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectation: Education sector calls for higher allocation and faster implementation of NEP,"As the Union Budget 2024 is around the corner, the education sector urges the government to elevate the investment in education. Experts from the education sector believe that if India aims to position itself as a developed economy in the next two decades in alignment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’, it is crucial to prioritise the education of children, the true architects of our nation’s destiny. “The proposed increase from 2.9% to 6% in the upcoming budget is not just a financial commitment but a strategic move towards empowering our youth with the skills and knowledge required to lead the nation into a prosperous future. By prioritising education, we are laying the foundation for an innovative and globally competitive India,” Manish Rastogi, Whole-Time Director and Chief Executive Officer, Zee Learn Ltd, said.

Linking teachers’ salaries to their qualifications is a strategy designed to promote ongoing professional development throughout their careers. This approach not only aims to elevate the quality of education but also rewards educators for their commitment to growth, as per the experts. “Essential to this strategy are robust teacher training programmes, regular assessments and feedback mechanisms involving parents and students. Transparent reporting systems are also crucial, as they help address any deviations in educational quality through continuous monitoring and feedback loops,” Rastogi added.

Reflecting on the current educational landscape, Aishwarya Rao, Director of The Vivekalaya Group of Institutions, highlights the significance of recent budgetary allocations. She states, “Our expectations are shaped by the recent trends and significant allocations in the education sector. The notable increase to Rs 68,805 crore for school education and Rs 44,095 crore for higher education in the 2023 budget reflects a commendable commitment to strengthening our educational framework. We hope to see this trend continue, particularly with a focus on augmenting digital infrastructure and teacher training programmes. These are critical areas that require substantial investment to ensure equitable and quality education for all students.



Adding to that she said, “We anticipate targeted funding for innovative educational technologies and inclusive education initiatives, which are essential for preparing our students to thrive in a rapidly evolving global landscape.”

On the other hand, Kunal Vasudeva, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Indian School of Hospitality, stresses the urgency of accelerating the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. He warns, “After the introduction of the NEP 2020, it is crucial to accelerate its implementation. Without swift action, we risk stagnation in our educational advancements and miss the opportunity to prepare our students for a rapidly evolving global landscape.”

He further believes that Institutions, particularly niche ones, must be granted autonomy swiftly with appropriate safeguards in place. This autonomy is vital for the nation’s growth, especially in specialised sectors. If this does not happen now, we face the danger of stifling innovation and falling behind in global competitiveness.

Looking ahead, we advocate for the introduction of targeted schemes and increased budgetary allocations in crucial areas such as Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), teacher training and the development of skill-based courses for K-12 students. These strategic investments are essential for cultivating a strong and dynamic educational ecosystem, Rastogi stated.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/jobs-career/education/budget-2024-expectation-education-sector-calls-for-higher-allocation-and-faster-implementation-of-nep/3558488/

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: FICCI says GDP growth forecast at 7%, CII demands increase in MGNREGA wages","In its latest Economic Outlook Survey, FICCI has projected a median GDP growth rate of 7.0% for the fiscal year 2024-25. The survey indicates a forecasted growth of 3.7% for agriculture and allied activities, marking a significant improvement from the 1.4% growth observed in the previous fiscal year 2023-24. Optimism surrounds agricultural prospects due to the diminishing El Nino effect and expectations of a normal southwest monsoon. Concurrently, the industry and services sectors are expected to grow by 6.7% and 7.4% respectively in the current fiscal year, underlining positive economic sentiments across key sectors.

For the first and second quarters of 2024-25, median GDP growth rates are estimated at 6.8% and 7.2% respectively. Inflation, measured by CPI, is forecasted at 4.5% for 2023-24, with expectations of easing in food prices as the kharif harvest reaches the market. Economists anticipate a cautious approach from the RBI, projecting a potential repo rate cut to 6.0% by March 2025, contingent on inflation trends.



The present round of FICCI’s Economic Outlook Survey was conducted in the month of July 2024 and drew responses from leading economists representing industry, banking and financial services sector. The economists were requested to share their forecast for key macro-economic variables for the year 2024-25 and for Q1 (April-June) and Q2 (July-September) FY25.



Given the Union Budget 2024-25 will be announced next week, the participating economists were asked to share their expectations from the first major public policy announcement of the new government. The economists anticipated continuity in policy and further momentum in reforms already being undertaken by the government.

The median forecast for CPI-based inflation stands at 4.5% for the fiscal year 2023-24, with a range of 4.4% to 5.0%. Persistent inflationary pressures are noted in cereals, fruits, and milk, although survey respondents anticipate price moderation in the second quarter as kharif season output enters the market.

Regarding RBI’s monetary policy, economists foresee a potential repo rate cut in the latter half of the fiscal year, reflecting the central bank’s cautious stance amidst inflation concerns. The policy repo rate is projected to decline to 6.0% by the end of fiscal year 2024-25 (March 2025).



Over capital expenditure, analysts noted that while there could be room to increase the target, expectations are aligned with the Rs 11.1 trillion figure outlined in the interim budget for FY2025, suggesting minimal deviation from this planned amount.

The survey participants anticipate reforms aimed at stimulating economic growth through potential revisions in tax rates. The focus is on boosting disposable income and consumption, especially for lower income brackets. Enhancements to limits under Section 80C and similar provisions are suggested to encourage long-term savings and investment. Simplification of the capital gains tax regime and efforts to streamline GST slabs are also expected.

They have also emphasised the importance of robust investment in education and healthcare to bolster human capital development and improve overall public health outcomes. This focus aims to ensure equitable access to quality education and healthcare services, contributing significantly to the nation’s socio-economic advancement.

What are the recommendations of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)?

The CII has recommended to retain fiscal deficit of 5.1% of GDP for 2024-25 as was announced in the Interim Budget, and also adhere to the glide path of fiscal deficit of 4.5% of GDP by FY26.

-On trade and exports: Set up a Trade Promotion Body with dedicated offices overseas for branding and promotion activities, as well as for providing marketing services to Indian exporters.

-On consumption demand – Cut taxes on fuel to raise disposable incomes and boost consumption and increase MNREGA wages and DBT amount under PM-Kisan.

-On Capex, CII recommended increasing it by 25% over revised estimates for FY24. It also asked to allocate higher capex for rural infrastructure like irrigation, cold chain.

-On GST, it has asked to bring products that are not under the GST regime to bring it under it.

-It has also recommended to introduce employment linked incentive (ELI) scheme for labour-intensive sectors, announce programmes for more agri services on the lines of ‘Drone Didi’.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-ficci-says-gdp-growth-forecast-at-7-cii-demands-increase-in-mgnrega-wages-3558459/
financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: 5 key announcements senior citizens can expect from FM Nirmala Sitharaman,"Senior citizens, just like salaried taxpayers and the general public, are eagerly anticipating the Union Budget 2024 with optimism. The challenges posed by high inflation and increasing living costs, coupled with limited income, have significantly impacted their quality of life.

It is important to recognize that many senior citizens rely on fixed income investments or rental income to sustain their financial needs, making them in need of additional financial assistance and guidance compared to other age demographics.

Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India, says, “As per statistics, more that 10 percent of India’s population are senior citizens aged 60 years and above. Also, with the focus of the government on senior citizens with the schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana, Ayushman Bharat etc. as part of its 100-day agenda, some changes can be expected in the upcoming budget for this category of individuals from a tax standpoint.”





Some of the changes that senior citizens can expect from the Budget 2024 are mentioned below:

1. Increase in Standard Deduction

The current limit for standard deduction under both the new and old tax regime is Rs 50,000. In most cases, senior citizens avail this deduction against the pension income that they earn. Considering the ever-increasing cost of living, it would be prudent to evaluate enhancing this deduction limit to Rs 1 lakh at least.

2. Increase in the Limit for Deduction under Section 80TTB

Currently, the deduction under Section 80TTB for a resident senior citizen on account of interest earned on bank deposits, post office deposits etc. is capped at Rs 50,000. “Given that the majority of senior citizens invest in bank deposits considering it to be a secured mode of investment for their future, the deduction limit may be increased to Rs 1 lakh. Also, this deduction may be allowed even under the New Tax Regime,” says Sirwalla.

3. Tax Deduction on House Rent

An additional important anticipation involves the implementation of a tax deduction for elderly individuals who are not receiving regular pensions and are renting a house. This measure has the potential to ease the financial strain on senior citizens living in rented homes, providing them with essential relief and stability in their housing costs, according to CAclubindia.

4. Increase in Health Insurance Premium Deductions

There is speculation that the government may raise the deductions on health insurance premiums for senior citizens, with the current limit of Rs 50,000 potentially being increased to at least Rs 1 lakh. This adjustment is intended to address the increasing healthcare costs and enhance seniors’ access to medical care, ensuring they have the necessary support to maintain their health and well-being.



5. Increase in LTCG Tax Exemption Limit

As per Caclubindia, the government is expected to raise the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax exemption limit for senior citizens from Rs 1 lakh to at least Rs 2 lakh. This potential change is expected to offer senior citizens more financial flexibility and increased tax relief on capital gains, which could in turn promote continued investment in financial markets.

Apart from these, senior citizens are also looking forward to a raise in the tax exemption thresholds for both the old and new tax systems, as well as tax-free pensions from NPS, EPS, and other sources. Additionally, they seek the rationalization of Section 194P to extend the age limit for senior citizens to be exempt from filing income tax returns over 75 years.

Senior citizens, thus, eagerly anticipate measures that will enhance their comfort, particularly in today’s fast-paced world. This could include deadline extensions, adjusted timelines, or special provisions for income tax deductions, filing, or rebates. Any such announcements made by the government would result in senior citizens having more disposable income in the face of increasing inflation.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-5-key-announcements-senior-citizens-can-expect-from-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-3557109/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: India’s business landscape anticipates transformative Budget,"As India stands on the cusp of presenting Budget 2024, industry leaders across various sectors are voicing their expectations and hopes for policies that could reshape the nation’s economic landscape. From finance to real estate, education to technology, stakeholders are calling for reforms that could propel India’s growth story forward.

Financial Sector Seeks Level Playing Field

In the financial sector, there’s a strong push for addressing disparities and enhancing operational efficiency. Akshay Sarma, Chief Financial Officer of axio, highlights several key areas that need attention:



“As we get closer to the upcoming budget, it is important to address the challenges in the finance sector. The dissimilarity in tax treatment of banks and NBFCs must be resolved. TDS exemption under section 194A to NBFCs would mitigate liquidity strains. Similarly, allowing NBFCs to carry forward accrued losses in case of amalgamation or demerger, equivalent to how banks can under section 72A, will facilitate consolidation initiatives in the sector.”

Sarma also emphasizes the need to resolve the issue of double taxation on ESOPs, suggesting, “Collecting the tax at the point of sale of the shares can reduce the burden of cash flow on employees.” He advocates for allowing companies to claim ESOP expenses on an accrual basis in the Income Tax Act.

Furthermore, Sarma points out the potential for boosting digital NBFCs: “Innovation in digital NBFCs can be bolstered with the introduction of tax reliefs and incentives for technology and infrastructure investments.”

Real Estate Sector Calls for Industry Status

The real estate sector, a significant contributor to India’s GDP and employment, is looking for substantial support in the upcoming budget. Ashish Puravankara, Managing Director of Puravankara Limited, articulates the sector’s aspirations:

“As the Union Budget 2024 approaches, we hope the government will continue supporting the growth of the real estate sector, recognising its contributions to India’s economic development. The sector plays a vital role in employment generation and contributes significantly to our GDP. We urge the government to grant industry status, which will help unlock access to funding, boost mid-income and affordable housing, and stimulate economic growth.”

Puravankara also highlights the need for income tax rebates on housing loans, stating, “Given the increase in salaries and interest rates, income tax rebates for principal and interest repayments will go a long way towards boosting housing.”

Technology and Skill Development Take Center Stage

The technology sector is at the forefront of India’s economic transformation, with expectations for policies that will drive innovation and skill development. Sachin Alug, CEO of NLB Services, outlines several key areas for improvement: “Royalty Payments – Indian firms often pay royalties to foreign technology owners for critical expertise. Clear guidelines are needed to regulate these transactions and attract more investment. Leveraging New Age Technologies – The IT sector anticipates policies that promote the widespread adoption and integration of cutting-edge technologies. Enhancing Digital Infrastructure – Investments in broadband connectivity and advanced data centers are crucial for smart cities and e-governance solutions.”

Alug also emphasizes the need for clear definitions in online gaming, skill development initiatives, and measures to boost digital payments and foster AI research.

Education Sector Looks for Innovation and Accessibility

The education sector is calling for reforms that will make learning more accessible and future-ready. Abhimanyu Saxena, Co-Founder of InterviewBit and Scaler, presents a comprehensive vision: “The country’s future hinges on a multi-pronged approach that simultaneously tackles affordability, accessibility, and future-proofing our education system. By strategically investing in rural internet infrastructure and lowering the GST on online education, we can revolutionise equitable access to learning opportunities.”

Saxena highlights the potential of AI in education and calls for government support in developing AI-powered learning tools and implementing teacher training programs. He also advocates for budgetary allocation towards creativity and innovation labs in educational institutions.

Startups and Social Entrepreneurship in Focus

The startup ecosystem, particularly in the social impact sector, is looking for sustained support and new initiatives. Vipul Nath Jindal, CEO and MD of Next Bharat Ventures, A Suzuki Initiative, expresses the sector’s expectations: “We are hopeful for initiatives that will streamline access to patient capital, providing long-term, low-interest funding to entrepreneurs, especially those working in the social impact sector for creating positive change. There needs to be a realignment in terms of policy frameworks and bureaucratic processes to create an ecosystem for these impact entrepreneurs allowing them the time and resources needed to grow their ventures sustainably.”

Jindal also calls for tax-based incentives for investments in the social impact space to stimulate investor interest and drive growth within the sector.

As the nation awaits the unveiling of the Union Budget 2024-25, these industry voices reflect the diverse needs and aspirations of India’s business landscape. From addressing sector-specific challenges to fostering innovation and inclusivity, the expectations are high for a budget that will set the stage for India’s next phase of economic growth and development.

The government’s response to these expectations will be crucial in shaping India’s economic trajectory in the coming years, balancing the needs of various sectors while aiming for overall economic prosperity and inclusivity.

Varun Babbar, Managing Director – India and SAARC, Qlik says:

“As we anticipate the new government under Prime Minister Modi, we expect strong backing for the ‘Viksit Bharat’ initiative—a vision introduced for accelerating the nation’s development and promoting economic inclusivity. This transformation requires placing technology at its core. Prioritizing the adoption of digital technologies across critical sectors, especially governance, will encourage inclusivity and efficiency in delivering social and welfare schemes.”



Adding, “Increased investment in policies that simplify doing business and empower startups and emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), is essential. As AI continues transforming sectors like healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and education, implementing proactive measures to ensure its responsible development is crucial.”



“That said, future AI guidelines should emphasize safety, ethical standards, and societal welfare while fostering innovation. Designing AI with a human-centered approach—emphasizing fairness, transparency, and accountability can address ethical concerns and mitigate risks associated with AI misuse, like deepfake technology and job displacement.



These steps are central to driving sustainable growth through data-driven insights and innovation,” Varun Babbar said.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-indias-business-landscape-anticipates-transformative-budget-3557227/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Streamlining TDS / TCS provisions is the need of the hour – Here’s why,"Tax Deducted at Source (“TDS”) and Tax Collected at Source (“TCS”) provisions under the Income Tax Act of 1961 (“Act”) have been the cornerstone of the country’s tax architecture. A taxpayer is expected to be vigilant at the time of entering into any transaction and must ensure correct tax is deducted / collected and deposited with the exchequer.

TDS provisions are continually amended to reflect the evolving business landscape, including modern-day sectors like digital platforms and online gaming. The extensive nature of TDS / TCS provisions, spread over more than 40 sections with rates ranging from 0.1% to 40%, illustrates their broad reach (covering residents as well as non-residents). With the ever-increasing amendments to the TDS / TCS provisions, it has made compliance more challenging and complex for taxpayers, especially for MSMEs having limited administrative capabilities.

The current tax regime mandates several TDS / TCS compliances to be adhered to by the taxpayer. As a first step, the deductor is required to evaluate TDS / TCS liability after interpreting the provisions of the Act and deduct or collect TDS / TCS as per relevant section. Thereafter, the taxpayer has to deposit the taxes to the credit of the Central government within the timelines provided. Following the same, the taxpayer is supposed to file TDS / TCS returns quarterly and also issue requisite TDS certificates. All these compliances are to be done within the stipulated time, and non-compliance leads to levy of interest, disallowance of expenditure, penal consequences and even prosecution in certain cases.





Taxpayers often encounter legal disputes over payment classification, such as distinguishing between “commission” & “discount”, “works contract” from “contract of sale”, identifying “reimbursement” vs “benefit/perquisite,” and delineating fee for professional services (FPS) vs fee for technical services (FTS).

Further, over the last couple of years (especially vide the Finance Act’s of 2020, 2021 and 2022), the scope of TDS provisions has been extended to virtually cover almost all the transactions entered into by the taxpayers. This is being undertaken with the sole objective of deepening and widening the tax base (by tracking the underlying transactions). With the introduction of the new TDS and TCS provisions, taxpayers are facing difficulties in identifying which TDS or TCS provision applies to a particular transaction since there are overlaps, especially in cases of section 206C(1H) and 194Q.

Section 206C(1H) imposes an obligation on the seller to collect tax from the buyer of goods, and section 194Q requires a buyer to deduct tax from the sum paid or payable to the seller of goods. As both sections apply to one transaction (i.e., sale and purchase of goods), it is likely that a transaction might be covered under both provisions in some situations. Where it does, the buyer shall have the first obligation to deduct the tax. In other words, the seller will not have any obligation to collect tax under Section 206C(1H) in such a scenario. Applying TDS and TCS provisions on the same transaction (subject to conditions) is effectively duplicating compliance. Besides, this is onerous for a seller (to comply with TCS) since he needs to not only ensure his compliance but also keep a check on whether the buyer has done TDS or not.

Also, large taxpayers (taking the example of e-commerce operators covered under section 194-O) are required to report line-by-line humongous volume of transactions in the quarterly TDS returns. Given that, in each day for a given quarter, multiple transactions are undertaken through the e-commerce operator’s platform, it is very likely that for various sellers the transactions run in a million-line items in a quarter which creates large and voluminous amount of data for compliance. Reporting large volume of transactions in the quarterly TDS return and issuing TDS certificates complying with section 194-O is extremely challenging due to inability of the utility to allow large volumes of transactions and delays on the portal.

The above-mentioned practical challenges can be addressed if appropriate corrective actions / measures are undertaken, such as:

* Such large taxpayers could be allowed to report a consolidated monthly entry per vendor to reduce the volume of quarterly transactions for reporting and issuing TDS certificates;

* The need for issuance of separate TDS/ TCS certificates could be done away with in order to reduce compliance burden on taxpayers (as in any case the information is reported in Form 26AS);

* On a policy level, a more consultative approach could be adopted to ensure that taxpayers are receptive to the proposed amendments.

All in all, though TDS / TCS collections are vital and a faster way for government to collect tax, rationalization and simplification of the TDS / TCS provisions will be a step towards easing compliances, which would be fruitful for the taxpayers and the income-tax department.

As stakeholders look forward to the Union Budget 2024, there is a sense of optimism regarding forthcoming reforms. Additionally, the aforesaid corrective actions / measures, once implemented would foster a conducive environment for business growth, particularly benefiting the MSME sector, which is a critical driver of the economy. By addressing these needs, the government would support economic development and enhance the ease of doing business in India.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: ‘Need to introduce policies to provide direct and indirect tax benefits for R&D and investments’,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will announce Union Budget 2024-25 on July 23. Ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25, industry leaders of the healthcare sector emphasise on the need to enhance quality healthcare in India.

“We commend the government’s efforts to enhance quality healthcare in India and are optimistic about the continued reforms and policies aimed at bolstering innovation and streamlining regulatory processes. We at OPPI look forward to the upcoming Union budget and are hopeful that it will have a positive impact on the healthcare and pharma sector. To accelerate R&D and innovation, we urge the government to explore methods to incentivize R&D investments, such as deductions on R&D expenses, research-linked incentives for MNCs, and corporate tax concessions,” Anil Matai, Director General, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) said.

Matai also said that recognizing the high-risk, long-gestation nature of R&D, we suggest extending the scope of section 115BAB of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to companies solely engaged in pharmaceutical research and development and providing a 200% deduction rate on R&D expenditures.



“This would significantly boost our ability to undertake essential research and development, including clinical trials and patent registration. Furthermore, establishing an effective intellectual property rights regime is critical for driving growth and encouraging research based pharma companies, both global & Indian to introduce innovative therapies in India towards addressing unmet medical needs. We recommend introducing incentives for centers and companies that provide specialized training programs for pharmaceutical employees, promoting growth and supporting continuous professional development in the sector,” he told Financial Express.com.

Incentives for developing treatments for rare diseases are also crucial. Besides, enhancing the management of rare diseases through more CoEs, increased budget allocations for incentivising R&D on therapies for rare disease, and import duty waivers are is essential, he said.

Expanding the list of life-saving drugs eligible for GST/import duty exemptions, including all oncology medications, will further improve patient affordability. Lastly, to attract investment and contribute to a more resilient and future-ready pharmaceutical industry under Atma Nirbhar Bharat, the government should provide incentives for investments in bonds issued by pharmaceutical companies, he added.



“We look forward to the government’s continued support and strategic initiatives to foster a robust and innovative pharmaceutical sector in India. We are confident that these measures will accelerate R&D and innovation, ultimately leading to a healthier, more resilient, and self-reliant India,” Matai told Financial Express.com.

Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance highlighted that Indian pharmaceutical industry has been instrumental in shaping global health outcomes by providing affordable, quality medicines.

“The industry is now at a pivotal moment, with an aspiration to grow to USD 120 billion by 2030. The policy direction should leverage the industry’s knowledge-driven foundation and its status as a global manufacturing hub. The thrust should be on Quality and Innovation. Given the high risk, lengthy development periods, and low success rates in research, continuous investment is crucial,” Jain told Financial Express.com.

The 2024-25 budget should introduce policies that provide direct and indirect tax benefits to encourage research and investment in becoming global benchmark in quality, he added.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-need-to-introduce-policies-to-provide-direct-and-indirect-tax-benefits-for-rd-and-investments-3557190/
financialexpress.com,"Union Budget 2024: Anticipated Boosts for EVs, Hybrids, and Flex-Fuel Technologies to Drive Sustainable Mobility","By Saket Mehra & Astha Malik

India’s automotive industry had a strong year in FY 2023-24, with significant growth across almost all segments, building on the healthy growth observed in the previous financial year. Passenger vehicle sales rose by 8% to 4.22 million units, while commercial vehicle sales saw a modest 1% increase, reaching 0.97 million units. The two-wheeler market expanded by 13% with 17.97 million units sold, and three-wheeler sales increased materially by 42% to 0.69 million units (with E-3 Wheelers making up for over 58% of the total three-wheeler sales). Overall, the industry’s domestic sales hit 23.85 million units, marking a 12% year-on-year growth. The electric vehicle (EV) market also made impressive strides, with total sales jumping 42% to 1.67 million units. E-2 wheelers led the charge with a 30% increase, followed by E-3 wheelers with a 57% rise, and E-4 wheelers almost doubling their sales. Backed by strong sales, the auto-component sector also thrived, with a record turnover of INR 5.6 trillion, up by 32.8%. Overall, FY24 was a milestone year for India’s auto industry.

Transitioning to renewable energy is important for India to achieve its net zero emissions objective by 2070, and the automotive industry plays an essential role in this journey. With electric vehicle (EV) penetration levels in India rising to 6.8% in FY24 from 5% in FY23, the industry is on an upward trajectory, but it requires robust government support to maintain this momentum. The upcoming Union budget presents an opportunity to adopt a growth-oriented strategy, prioritising indigenous manufacturing and incentivising adoption of alternative fuel solutions.



Areas where the Budget can support the automotive industry to aid this transition are:

Boosting country’s energy transition readiness: India’s commitment to green and sustainable mobility is reflected in its ambitious “Panchamrit” goals, including raising the non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity of the country to 500 GW by 2030 (overarching goal being achieving net zero emissions by 2070). Despite significant regulatory and policy commitments, India ranks 63rd out of 120 in the World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index. A deeper dive into transition readiness highlights two critical areas requiring immediate attention: education and human capital, with fewer jobs available in renewable energy, and innovation, where environmental technologies constitute only about 10% of all technologies in India. Addressing these gaps is essential for accelerating the transition to electric and hybrid mobility.

To foster innovation within the renewables and alternative fuel technologies sectors, public-private partnerships and policy support are crucial. The Union Budget should focus on incentivising research and development, enhancing infrastructure for EVs, and promoting skills development in the renewable energy sector. These measures will be essential in positioning India as a leader in sustainable mobility and renewable energy innovation.

Strengthening the EV ecosystem: Strengthening the EV ecosystem is crucial for India’s transition to green mobility. There’s significant anticipation for clarity on the FAME-III subsidy, which is expected to focus on mass transportation and alternative fuels but may exclude electric cars, even those for commercial use. Hybrid cars are expected to receive support as a part of the subsidy.



In addition to incentives aimed at boosting EV registrations, the budget should extend support across the entire EV ecosystem. This includes promoting indigenous production, enabling fast-charging infrastructure uniformly across the country, establishing a comprehensive battery swapping policy, and tailoring insurance norms for electric vehicles. Currently, EV manufacturing relies heavily on imported components, underscoring the need to support local manufacturers of battery packs, motors, controllers, and key electronics. Localising the supply chain is essential to bridge the cost gap between EVs and traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. A robust local supply chain can significantly reduce EV costs, making them more accessible and fostering sustainable growth in India’s EV market. With over 200 EVs per charging point compared to 20 in the US and 10 in China, India’s charging infrastructure requires rapid expansion (currently there are ~12,000 operational public charging EV stations in the country).

Tax incentives to strong hybrids: Since subsidies for hybrids were discontinued in 2017 and the government imposed a 15% cess on hybrid cars under the GST regime, the tax incidence has risen from 30.3% excise to 43% GST, making hybrid cars significantly more expensive. Despite these higher taxes, hybrid car sales nearly matched those of EVs in the first quarter of 2024. While the government’s primary focus is on strengthening the EV ecosystem, there is potential to provide tax incentives for strong hybrids. These incentives would make hybrids more affordable, encouraging consumers to choose them over petrol and diesel alternatives. Such a move would not only reduce emissions but also bridge the gap during the transition to a fully electric vehicle market.

Since subsidies for hybrids were discontinued in 2017 and the government imposed a 15% cess on hybrid cars under the GST regime, the tax incidence has risen from 30.3% excise to 43% GST, making hybrid cars significantly more expensive. Despite these higher taxes, hybrid car sales nearly matched those of EVs in the first quarter of 2024. These incentives would make hybrids more affordable, encouraging consumers to choose them over petrol and diesel alternatives. Such a move would not only reduce emissions but also bridge the gap during the transition to a fully electric vehicle market. Incentives for wider production of flex-fuel technology: With the government advancing the 20 percent ethanol blended petrol (E20) from 2030 to 2025, there is a requirement for an estimated 2.68 billion gals or 10.15 billion litres of ethanol. To promote the adoption of flex-fuel technology, the Union Budget should consider targeted incentives to address the associated challenges. Flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) face issues such as increased engine wear due to ethanol, resulting in higher stress and corrosion. Additionally, fuel economy varies, especially with higher ethanol blends like E85, reducing overall efficiency. Infrastructure limitations also pose significant hurdles, necessitating substantial investments to support the shift, with an annual requirement of over 1,000 crore liters of ethanol for the E20 program. Budget incentives could include subsidies for research and development to mitigate engine wear, funding for infrastructure expansion, and financial support to offset the higher costs of FFVs. These measures would facilitate the adoption of flex-fuel technology and advance India’s commitment to sustainable mobility.

Globally, the automotive industry contributes to ~10% of world’s carbon dioxide emissions, with India being the third largest carbon dioxide emitter globally. The Union Budget presents an opportunity to drive India’s transition to sustainable mobility. By focusing on boosting the country’s energy transition readiness, strengthening the EV ecosystem, providing tax incentives for strong hybrids, and supporting the wider production of flex-fuel technology, the government can address key challenges and promote green transportation solutions. These measures will not only reduce emissions and bridge the cost gap between EVs and traditional vehicles but also position India as a leader in renewable energy innovation and sustainable mobility. A comprehensive, growth-oriented strategy in the budget will be instrumental in achieving India’s net zero emissions goal by 2070.

financialexpress.com,Nestle Vs ITC Vs HUL: Why are key FMCG stocks in focus ahead of Budget 2024,"The first full Budget by the newly formed Modi 3.0 Cabinet- Budget 2024 will be tabled on July 23. With the onset of the monsoon and the Monsoon Session of the Parliament, it is a no-brainer that consumer staple companies, particularly FMCG majors are in focus. Companies like Nestle India, ITC, and Hindustan Unilever (HUL), are drawing significant investor attention.

Traders are closely watching the government’s potential moves to boost rural consumption and rev up the rural economy. The market is betting on the impact of these allocations on FMCG stocks.

“Over the past three months, there were price hikes across several HPC categories and in select F&B categories, possibly led by some transient inflationary headwinds,” said Kotak Institutional Equities. “On the raw material front, we witnessed a sequential decline in crude and palm oil prices, inflationary agri-prices, and stability in VAM and other chemical prices in May 2024.”



Stock Performance and Analyst Ratings

According to Trendlyne data, ITC’s consensus target price is Rs 495.79 apiece, suggesting a 17 percent upside, with 30 out of 34 analysts recommending a ‘buy’ call. Hindustan Unilever’s consensus target price is Rs 2580.50, indicating potential gains of 3 percent, but 25 out of 40 analysts suggest buying it. Nestle India is endorsed by 17 out of 36 analysts with an expected upside of 4 percent and a target price of Rs 2655.11.

HUL’s Performance and Outlook

After a subdued FY24, marked by negative pricing and slower recovery in rural and mass segments, FY25 is expected to see gradual recovery for HUL. In FY24, revenue increased by 3 percent with a volume growth of 2 percent. Home care, BPC (Beauty & Personal Care), and F&R (Foods & Refreshments) grew 3 percent, 2 percent, and 3 percent YoY respectively. HUL’s premium portfolio outperformed other segments in FY24, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities.

“Q1FY25 is likely to be muted with negative pricing of 2 percent and a harsh summer impacting volumes of hot beverages. However, we expect pricing growth to return in H2FY25. Additionally, rural volume growth is likely to recover in H2FY25 due to potentially good rainfall,” Nuvama added, maintaining a ‘buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 2,885.

Shares of HUL turned ex-dividend on June 14, 2024, for a final dividend of Rs 24 per share, resulting in a total dividend of Rs 64 per share and a dividend yield of 3 percent over the last 12 months. Axis Securities reported that Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and ITC are among the top 15 large-cap dividend-yielding companies. Additionally, Jefferies recently upgraded HUL to a ‘buy’ rating with a revised target price of Rs 2,950.

ITC’s Market Position and Challenges

Cigarette-to-stationery major ITC is also under investor scrutiny ahead of the budget. The demerger-bound company remains in focus due to the potential taxation of tobacco products in the budget.

Emkay Global has a positive outlook on ITC, citing its strong execution and favorable macroeconomic factors that support its diversified businesses. However, near-term business pressures, such as cigarette margin stress, demand in the paper business, margin weakness, and a slowdown in the agriculture sector, present challenges. Recently, Emkay downgraded ITC to ‘add.’

“For the cigarette business, we see margin pressure after two consecutive inflationary leaf crop seasons, leading to an estimated 60 basis points YoY margin compression for FY25, which is expected to recover in FY26. Additional pressure is likely from increased competition and anticipated higher tax hikes in the Union Budget,” Emkay stated, setting a target price of Rs 460 apiece.

Nestle’s Performance and Outlook

Nestle India’s FY24 annual report, covering a 15-month period ending March 24, underscores the company’s enduring strengths and positioning as a prime revenue growth opportunity in the Indian consumer sector, according to Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.

Despite recent subdued volume growth, Nirmal Bang noted that there are no significant changes to their earnings estimates for FY25 and FY26. However, they highlighted concerns over Nestle’s valuation, currently standing at 59 times FY26E EPS, which they deem expensive without offering substantial upside in the short term. Nirmal Bang values Nestle at 60 times FY26E EPS, setting a target price of Rs 2,550, while maintaining an ‘Accumulate’ stance on the stock.

Nestle India’s shares underwent a 1:10 split in January 2024, and the company announced a dividend of Rs 8.5 per share with a record date of July 16, 2024. Axis Securities has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Nestle India, forecasting a target price of Rs 2,880. Meanwhile, Kotak Institutional Equities maintains an ‘add’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,550.

It is expected to be full of big-ticket announcements for various sectors. Among the hopefuls are salaried taxpayers, who are anticipating some much-needed tax relief. In particular, those earning less than Rs 10 lakh per year are expected to benefit the most from the Modi government’s tax-relief measures, according to experts.

Since there have been no major changes in taxation policies in the last two budgets, except for making the new tax regime the default option and introducing the Standard Deduction feature, taxpayers are hopeful that the first budget of the Modi government’s third term might announce some significant tax breaks for them.



In the upcoming budget, it is widely expected that the Modi government will provide significant tax relief to those earning up to Rs 10 lakh. This measure aims to address the high cost of living and boost consumption by increasing disposable income.

Lower taxes for income up to Rs 10 lakh in budget likely

Under the new tax regime, FM Sitharaman may provide lower income tax rates for taxpayers earning up to Rs 10,00,000 annually, says Akhil Chandna, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat. Some tax relief is also expected for those taxpayers earning above Rs 15 lakh per annum, Chandna added.

“Such measures would lessen the tax burden on higher-income groups and enable lower-income groups to allocate more towards essential expenses and savings,” he emphasised.

Among other major expectations from the government in this upcoming budget are increasing the basic exemption limit and deductions under the new tax regime.

Increasing the basic exemption limit

Basic exemption limit under the new tax regime will increase from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in the upcoming budget. This enhancement will reduce the tax liability of taxpayers by Rs 10,000 (excluding cess and surcharge) for individuals earning annual incomes exceeding 7 lakh and who are not eligible for any rebate under Section 87A.



Deduction under new tax regime

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: What does the health sector expects?

Dr. P N Arora, Chairman of Yashoda Super Speciality Hospitals, Kaushambi, said, “An essential component of healthcare requirements focuses on the accessibility and affordability of services. The industry promotes the idea of subsidies or complementary health screenings, particularly for women and children, in order to enhance preventive care and early disease detection. Furthermore, there is a movement towards providing incentives and assistance for the local production of medical equipment to decrease dependence on imports and align with the 'Make in India' initiative.""

He further added that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer pose significant health challenges in India. There is a necessity for increased budgetary allocations to prevent, treat and manage NCDs, which includes backing research, public awareness campaigns, and making treatment options more readily available. The sector also stresses the significance of training and upskilling healthcare professionals to meet the changing healthcare needs with the help of new technologies.

In terms of health insurance, stakeholders are advocating for financial reforms to establish a more comprehensive and sustainable healthcare coverage model. This entails reevaluating GST rates on healthcare services and products to ensure affordability and accessibility for all socioeconomic groups. Moreover, there is a demand for insurance coverage for preventive healthcare measures, not just reactive medical treatments.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-live-updates-income-tax-slab-for-ay-2024-25-nirmala-sitharaman-3556290/
financialexpress.com,"Union Budget 2024: Fintech industry seeks tax incentives to boost consumption, drive growth","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the 2024-25 Union Budget on July 23. Ahead of the budget, the fintech industry has several expectations from the government. These expectations aim to support the sector, helping India achieve its goal of becoming the third largest economy in the world and becoming a developed country by 2047, in line with the government’s target.

The pre-budget discussions with industry groups have already kicked in and several industry leaders are expecting the government to make this budget growth-centric. Here are some key expectations from the upcoming budget.

Tax Relief Measures to Boost Consumption

There is widespread expectation that the Union Budget 2024 will introduce income tax reforms aimed at reducing the tax burden on lower income brackets to stimulate spending. Currently, income tax rates range from 5% for earnings above Rs 3 lakh to 30% for incomes exceeding Rs 15 lakh, in the new tax regime. There is potential for rationalising this structure to increase disposable incomes, thereby stimulating economic activity and GST collections.





Enhancements to the Tax Regime

Many taxpayers are eagerly anticipating changes in the new tax regime, which has not seen widespread adoption despite offering lower rates. There is hope for additional deductions to make this regime more attractive. A significant proposal under consideration is raising the Section 80C deduction limit from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh, a limit last revised during Arun Jaitley’s tenure as Finance Minister.

Expanding Benefits Under the Old Tax Regime

Section 80C of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, includes various savings and investments such as LIC and PPF contributions. However, stakeholders argue that the current Rs 1.5-lakh limit restricts investments in areas like fixed deposits, ELSS, and housing loan principal. There is strong anticipation for this deduction limit to be increased to Rs 2 lakh annually to accommodate a broader range of investment options.

Inclusion of additional documents in DigiLocker

Given the proven success and popularity of DigiLocker among Indian citizens, the inclusion of additional documents frequently required by banks and other financial institutions on the platform would further increase user convenience and help in the quick, secure, and transparent digital issuance of credit. These documents are EPFO passbook, e-PAN, and Form26 AS.

Adhil Shetty, CEO of Bankbankbazaar.com, says, “These additional documents can act as a digital proof of verification carried out by banks and lending institutions. Inclusion in DigiLocker would enable users to digitally access and submit their documents for quick approval of credit applications by banks and other financial institutions. For customers, they would have convenient, anytime access to their documents.”

Digital Lending Regulations for Fintechs

There is need for a level playing field between online and offline lending. Hence, there is a need to extend the consumer-centric regulation implemented for digital lending industry to the offline loan industry, too. This includes various consumer-centric measures mandated for digital loans such as key fact sheet of terms, grievance redressal processes, cooling-off period for loans, consent-based consumer data collection, storage, usage, and several such other measures currently limited to digital lending (Digital Lending Apps (DLAs)) only, being extended to all loans including loans disbursed via offline channels, which constitutes the majority of the market in India. Extending all regulations equally to both online and offline lending will create a level playing field for both types of lenders to grow and power India’s economic growth towards Vision 2046.

Taxation Parity of Listed and Unlisted Equities

Listed and unlisted equities should be treated at par for computation of LTCG. It goes without saying that the government should weed out shell companies for such LTCG benefit. This benefit can be extended to unlisted entities, including legitimate and genuine unlisted FinTechs and Start-Ups that provide critical value-addition to economy, with requisite qualification criteria:

1. In the BFSI sector, those fintech entities who are registered with one of the financial sector regulators.

2. In the MSME sector, those entities with Udyam Registration that meet requisite capital and revenue requirements.

Special Treatment for Startup ESOPs

In an earlier Union Budget, the Finance Ministry has aimed to revise the ESOP tax burden for start-up employees. To resolve the issue of dual taxation on employee-held ESOPs, the government proposed the deferment of the tax payment by five years, or until employees leave the company, or sell their shares – whichever comes earlier. However, due to the qualification criteria, benefits of this move have been limited to a few start-ups.

The industry recommends extending these benefits to more start-ups by relaxing the criteria:

1. In the BFSI sector, those fintech entities who are registered with one of the financial sector regulators

2. In the MSME sector, those entities with Udyam Registration that meeting requisite capital and revenue requirements.

Digital India Act

The Digital India Act requirements to align with other Regulated Entities and Digital Intermediaries.

Financial services entities are governed by multiple regulators including RBI, SEBI, PFRDA, and IRDA. They also come under guidelines like the Digital Lending Guidelines, and the DPDP Act, which outlines the norms for evolving digital ecosystem, digital services, digital apps, and financial intermediaries providing services to these regulated entities.

Regulated entities in the financial services industry, and financial intermediaries (including loan service providers, web aggregators, etc.) need unique considerations and distinct regulations due to their role in a multi-stakeholder ecosystem. These entities are subject to comprehensive, risk- based regulations. For instance, they retain data for longer, and report it far more broadly than other types of intermediaries due to KYC, anti-money laundering norms or obligations under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002.

Compliance with the financial sector digital norms should grant regulated entities and digital financial intermediaries safe harbor protection under the DIA. Financial intermediaries are often required to take specific actions on behalf of regulated entities and have extensive due diligence and due care obligations mandated under law. Liability imposed on financial intermediaries despite their compliance with extensive regulations should be rationalised as they could have unfair and damaging effects on the whole financial services sector. Therefore, that protection should continue to be made available to them till such time as they remain compliant with sector regulations.

These initiatives will help reduce the burden on the common man by leaving more money in their hands and pave the way for the growth of the fintech industry in the country.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-fintech-industry-seeks-tax-incentives-to-boost-consumption-drive-growth-3556379/

With this, the lock-in period has begun for the officials of the North Block-headquartered ministry. All officials who are part of the budget preparation will be able to go out only after Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman completes her budget speech in Parliament on July 23.

This custom, which is also a way of appreciating the hard work of all officials and staff involved in the tedious process, is the final step for the Budget. Apart from Sitharaman, other senior officials of the ministry such as Finance Secretary TV Somanathan, Financial Services Secretary Vivek Joshi, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth took part in the customary ceremony.



Union Budget 2024: What’s a lock-in at finance ministry

As the name suggests, the beginning of the lock-in period means all officials and staff involved in the budget preparation will stay in the North Block basement. No official is allowed to maintain any contact with the outside world. This is done to keep the secrecy of the annual financial statement intact.

Union Budget 2024: What’s inside the North Block basement?

The basement of the North Block used to be the main venue of printing all budget documents. The printing press inside the basement was in use for four decades between 1980 and 2020. However, once the Union Budget went all digital, the press was used to print only some key documents.

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: ‘Transformation of public infrastructure, upgrading medical colleges, and investing in rural healthcare needed’","Budget 2024 Expectations: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is all set to announce the Union Budget 2024 on July 23. Ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25, Vishal Bali, Executive Chairman, Asia Healthcare Holdings (AHH) said that India’s Budget 2024-25 comes on the back of a changed political environment in India however India’s growth story and potential in a world reeling under economic pressure remains more optimistic than ever.

“This is an opportune time for India to strike a balance between capital conservation and undertaking some aggressive reforms. The government has already indicated that the forthcoming budget would be aimed at sustaining the current economic growth trajectory of India. Countries aiming for self-sufficiency by driving domestic manufacturing as well as consumption would be the ones to float through swiftly in this much-anticipated economic turmoil,” Bali said.

According to Bali, India’s healthcare needs a reform approach to pivot change and drive the sector as a core agenda for the future of the country.



“And it goes without saying that a greater fiscal injection into the sector will be massively impactful. 2023-24 allocation of Rs 79221 crores represented a drop from 2022-23 allocation of Rs 86175 crores. In the interim budget of Feb 2024 the FM earmarked an allocation of Rs90171 crores. So over the last 3 yrs there has been no indication that healthcare is core to the Govt’s reform agenda for India through this overarching allocation in the budget. India’s public healthcare spending is still far below the target of 2.5% of the GDP. With each passing year not meeting that target pushes back long-term healthcare goals for the country,” he pointed out.



Public and Private Healthcare partnership are the way to go

Changes in the outlook on health and prioritising the sector through stimulus, more organised policy, enabling speedier adoption of digital tools and services, expanding the AyushmanBharat Digital Mission, and using its last mile reach to enable rural healthcare push must be expedited. The focus must be on transformation and not simply cosmetic changes applied to gaps in the system. Importance must be given to the transformation of public infrastructure, upgrading medical colleges, and investing in rural healthcare. Financial commitment must reach the public healthcare systems both at the metro cities and rural levels.

Bolstering medical education

A lot has been done to drive impetus to medical education which has resulted in the approval of 157 new medical colleges, however, there is a lack of teaching faculty in most of these colleges. There needs to be another policy change of bringing in a public-private partnership thought process where clinicians from private healthcare systems can take academic positions in medical colleges. The government needs to provide a much higher impetus to the private sector by giving tax incentives in setting up healthcare infrastructure and adding hospital bedsin tier 2-3 cities across the country to help reduce the demand-supply gap of healthcare in emerging India.

Supporting Indigenous Medical Technology Manufacturing

The sector needs an extremely robust and highly incentivised policy for domestic manufacturing of medical technology and consumables. Currently, India is importing Rs. 63,200 crore of medical devices and is over 80 percent dependent on imports. India needs self-reliance in this area which is largely dependent on imports. There needs to be continued support in terms of tax reforms for Research and Development in the medical technologies sector.

Healthcare is a GDP accelerator and budget 2025 should provide for exponential reform to the sector so it supports this objective, he emphasised.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-transformation-of-public-infrastructure-upgrading-medical-colleges-and-investing-in-rural-healthcare-needed-3555588/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Real estate looks for measures to enhance affordability, boost housing demand","The forthcoming Union Budget 2024-25 provides a critical chance for the Indian real estate industry to tackle different obstacles and stimulate development, especially in the affordable and luxury housing sectors. Now that the longest election in India’s history has concluded, attention has shifted to the new budget announcements.

Historically, the government has demonstrated a strategic emphasis on maintaining a balance between economic growth and fiscal discipline, as well as prioritizing infrastructure development and improving logistical connectivity. Of particular note is the substantial capital expenditure by the government, signaling a sustained dedication to infrastructure development that has contributed to the strengthening of the real estate sector. This has not only spurred investment in Indian real estate, but has also fostered a favorable environment for upcoming development initiatives.

Simplifying the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to lower expenses and easing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) regulations to entice overseas capital are considered crucial measures to improve accessibility and promote growth in the high-end market. Given that the real estate industry in India accounts for 8% of the country’s GDP, stakeholders are eagerly anticipating reforms that could spur additional investments from both international and local entities.





The real estate sector is seeking measures that will not only favor developers but also facilitate wider access to homeownership for a larger portion of the population. In order to encourage potential homebuyers, interested parties are advocating for a raise in the cap on home loan interest deductions. Raising the home loan interest deduction limit from ₹2 lakh to ₹5 lakh is proposed to significantly benefit middle-income homebuyers and stimulate demand. Additionally, there is a push to revise affordability housing caps under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), increasing the price cap from Rs 45 lakh to better reflect market variations across different cities.

Allocation of additional funds to the Special Window for Completion of Affordable and Mid-Income Housing Projects (SWAMIH) fund is also suggested. Increasing the allocation to the SWAMIH fund is crucial for resolving stalled projects and enhancing liquidity in the sector. An additional corpus of ₹50,000 crore is suggested to help bring stalled projects to completion. Encouraging policies that promote eco-friendly and innovative designs are essential for sustainable luxury housing. This could include incentives for developers to incorporate eco-friendly amenities.

Navdeep Sardana, Founder and Chairman, Whiteland Corporation. says, “The Indian economy is growing at an astounding 7.2%, and the real estate sector continues to contribute significantly in the national growth story. The real estate sector in India is expected to reach a milestone of $1 trillion in market size by 2030, up from $200 billion back in 2021, and contribute a significant 13% to the country’s GDP by 2025. This can be made possible by stable interest rates and conducive government fiscal policies. We are confident that the upcoming budget announcement will reflect the government’s commitment towards expanding the growing economy by prioritizing real estate sector and infrastructure development in the country.”

“In the previous budgets, the government has also shown a keen interest in leveraging eco-friendly construction practices to create sustainable, future-ready infrastructure projects. Hence, we do not expect any major changes in the tax structure, which might dissuade investors from the property market. As India embarks on building its bright future, the real estate sector stands ready and committed towards helping the nation realize its aspirations of becoming a developed nation in the coming decades,” he adds.

With the upcoming budget scheduled to be announced in about a week’s time, stakeholders are advocating for raising the affordability cap of housing from ₹45 lakh to ₹75 lakh in metro cities like MMR and NCR to make housing more accessible. Reintroducing the Credit-Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) under PMAY is seen as a way to incentivize first-time buyers of affordable homes. Increasing tax exemption limits on principal and interest paid on home loans is also recommended by the real estate sector.



Yashank Wason, Managing Director, Royal Green Realty, says, “In any developed nation, the real estate sector remains a significant contributor to GDP growth. The Indian real estate sector is no different. The government understands this and, in the past, has done much to encourage and bolster real estate growth. Infrastructure projects and logistical connectivity initiatives have been allocated significant funding and fast-tracked to reach timely completion. The RBI has further bolstered investor confidence through the implementation of an accommodative monetary policy, alongside efforts to control inflation amidst global geopolitical tensions. We anticipate that the forthcoming budget will sustain its backing of the Indian real estate sector by promoting infrastructure growth, with expectations of unchanged tax rates. The Indian economy is the fastest growing economy in the world and we are confident that with conducive government policies, the real estate sector will continue to bolster the national economy further in the perceivable future.”

Vipin Sharma, Founder & Chairman, Aarize Group, says, “As we approach the Budget 2024, the real estate sector anticipates measures to stimulate growth and sustainability across the industry. We emphasize the government to prioritize infrastructure development, streamline regulatory processes, and provide incentives for green building practices. Also, addressing taxation complexities and introducing reforms to boost transparency and ease of business will drive investment and foster long-term economic stability. We hope the upcoming budget will lay the groundwork for a more robust and resilient real estate landscape.”

S.K Narvar, Group Chairman, Trident Realty, says, “The real estate industry eagerly awaits the unveiling of the pre-budget landscape, as it yearns for measures that not only address the challenges but also nurture the growth of the ecosystem. Investors, developers, and homeowners alike stand poised, hoping for a budget that promotes ease in procedures, transparency in transactions, and encouragement for sustainable practices. The demand for fiscal incentives, tax reforms, and regulatory frameworks harmonized with the evolving needs of the industry resonates within the corridors of real estate power.”

The real estate industry is hopeful that the upcoming Union Budget 2024-25 will implement favorable measures aimed at enhancing affordability, boosting demand, and promoting sustainable development in every housing category. The visionary approach of the Central government in encouraging real estate growth, coupled with key infrastructure developments, positions the Indian realty sector for accelerated growth and economic vitality. With the government pushing renewable energy and eco-friendly construction, there is growing expectation that the upcoming budget would encourage sustainable development. The global audience is closely observing the remarkable progress of India, and the forthcoming budget will set the stage for future advancements and progress in the nation. As key contributors to India’s future, the real estate industry in India is prepared to fulfill the aspirations and ambitions of the country.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-real-estate-looks-for-measures-to-enhance-affordability-boost-housing-demand-3555205/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: Can the Budget rev up rural economy with support from Monsoon?,"The green shoots in the rural economy and the modest cyclical recovery has been dominating headlines across economic circles. The question that comes up now – is this just a blip or is this recovery sustainable? This is because recovery post Covid has been prinarily K-shaped. While there are some factors that offer a glimmer of hope like the FMCG sales volume and Kharif sowing that’s up 10% since last week of June, there are are concerns due to mixed auto sales and lower agri exports.

All eyes are now on the Upcoming Budget. What’s going to be the extent of allocations? Will Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman boost the rural economy with higher allocations and push public capex to bring about a greater cyclical recovery?

According to Tanvee Gupta Jain, Chief India Economist at UBS, expects a “cyclical recovery in rural consumption in FY25E, largely led by higher allocations for social sector schemes in the upcoming Union Budget and based on recent states’ budget and election promises, continued double-digit growth in public capex (to support rural jobs), normal monsoons and the likely removal of export bans on agricultural commodities.” That said, she cautions that at UBS they “maintain the view that the recovery in household consumption (in real terms) will remain below trend at 5-6% YoY in FY25/26E.”



The promise of rural aid

Broadly there are expectations that man of the previous schemes, especially the ones that support the rural economy may be continued and there could be higher allocation to boost the recovery cycle. UBS expects the government to expand “previously announced schemes, especially rural housing and rural roads, but within fiscal boundaries. We also expect the central government to maintain double-digit growth in public capex in FY25E (15-20% YoY). Over the past year, many Indian states have (or promised) increased allocation towards welfare schemes, including higher cash transfers to farmers, bonus over MSP and farm loan waivers in addition to increases in their capex spend.“

Welfare, no doubt continues to be a buzzword ahead of the upcoming Budget. Given the way, the current Modi 3.0 Cabinet has to balance politics and prudent fiscal consolidation, all eyes are on the size of the allocations, especially for these rural schemes.



Monsoon support

The other crucial factor that plays a decidedly important role in sprucing up rural demand is Monsoon. It’s raining cats and dogs in many parts of the country and overall it is expected to be a good monsoon this year. The rainfall so far is 2% above normal and projections indicate that the going remains steady, It is expected to not just support output targets but also help shore up demand in rural regions as a result of increased income.

Tanvee Gupta Jain adds that, “Last year’s El Niño related weather aberrations and current low reservoir levels makes this monsoon far more relevant. Summer crop production (c50% share of food grain production) is largely dependent on rainfall during the monsoon season. Good rainfall generally helps boost rural sentiment and thus provides some uplift to rural spending, although not necessarily backed up by a sharp improvement in rural incomes.”

Rate cut if rains support

The UBS report also highlights the “possibility of early rate cut if inflation surprises on the downside.” Although food has a weight of 46% in the CPI, they estimate “22% of the CPI basket is directly impacted by the monsoons. Normal rainfall generally contains food price pressure that has remained above 8% YoY since November 23.” According to Jain, the UBS inflation forecast “trajectory suggests that CPI inflation is tracking at 4.2% YoY versus the RBI’s forecast of 4.5% for FY25, increasing the possibility of a change in policy.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-can-the-budget-rev-up-rural-economy-with-support-from-monsoon-3554808/

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectation: Fiscal consolidation to continue but may see shift in spending mix, says Barclays; Will there be more allocations to core schemes?","With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman all set to present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, economists at Barclays said that the government is expected to signal policy continuity, showcasing fiscal consolidation, however, with a marginal shift in spending mix. Shreya Sodhani, Regional Economist, Barclays, said, “While maintaining focus on capex, we think the government will use increased receipts to fund higher revenue spending, balancing economic and political needs.”

Two important developments that have taken place on the fiscal front are higher-than-projected tax revenues in the first quarter which may lead to the government increasing its tax collections estimates; and a high dividend of Rs 2.1 lakh crore announced by the RBI.

Per the analysis by Barclays, the Budget will balance economic imperatives with political ones. “In terms of the deficit, this would mean the government using the windfall from the RBI dividend and higher tax revenues to fund higher spending, rather than reducing the deficit from the interim budget estimate, which already suggested accelerated consolidation,” it said, while maintaining that the government is expected to stick to its target for the fiscal deficit to reach 4.5 per cent by FY25-26. In the interim Budget, the government had pegged the fiscal deficit of 5.1 per cent for the full fiscal. However, per sources, the government might reduce it to 5 per cent in the full Budget for FY25.



Barclays expects spending to be raised by approximately 3.6 per cent from the interim Budget. “The share of capital expenditure in total spending will likely still be the highest since FY 2004-05, maintaining the government’s policy over the past five years of focusing on capital expenditure, while also increasing welfare spending,” said Shreya Sodhani. She further stated that in terms of subsidies, there might be an increase in allocations to some core welfare schemes, but there will be no announcement of any schemes that would need higher spending over the long term while tempering the expectations of fiscal consolidation down the line.

Fiscal deficit: Will NDA 3.0 demonstrate intent?

The Union Budget, to be tabled by the finance minister on July 23, will have all eyes on it with the presence of allies which has increased scrutiny on whether the BJP-led government will change its policy focus on fiscal consolidation and switch to increased revenue expenditure, at the cost of capex.

Shreya Sodhani said, “We expect the Budget to signal continued fiscal consolidation, not only for FY24-25, but over the medium term, establishing policy continuity as the BJP has tried to do with the cabinet formation. While some increase in revenue spending seems likely, we do not expect capital expenditure to be reduced in compensation. Higher revenues, with resilient domestic activity and normalisation in the growth rate of capital expenditure – already baked into the interim Budget – will allow the government to maintain fiscal prudence.”

While one-off revenue like the RBI dividend provide some comfort on the fiscal deficit target for FY25, will the government be able to achieve the medium-term targets? “The government’s earlier stated target for the fiscal deficit in FY25-26 is 4.5 per cent of GDP. This means 60bp of consolidation for FY26, which we think should be achievable. We expect nominal GDP to grow 11.9 per cent in FY26, which means the deficit would need to be reduced by less than ~Rs 362 billion (~2 per cent of current deficit),” stated the report by Barclays.

Robust revenue receipts

Revenue receipts, particularly tax receipts, turned out to be more robust than the government’s revised estimates in FY23-24. According to the provisional accounts data, gross tax revenue at Rs 34.6 trillion (up 13.4 per cent YoY), was slightly higher than the revised estimates presented for FY24 in February (Rs 34.4 trillion). The strong growth in tax receipts was driven largely by fast growth in personal income tax and GST collections. Non-tax receipts were also robust, driven by both higher interest receipts and dividends from the RBI and other public sector financial institutions. For FY24-25, per Barclays revenue receipts (Rs 31.7 trillion, net) are expected to be to be higher than the government’s estimates made in the interim budget (Rs 30.0 trillion, FY23-24: Rs 27.3 trillion).

Increase in expenditure expected

With additional revenue headroom, the government is likely to increase expenditure, said Barclays. “While revenues registered a strong increase in FY23-24, expenditure growth moderated to the softest in nearly two decades, which in our view suggests an increase in spending is likely. Finally, we think the election results should spur the government to expand spending given the scope to do so, while maintaining its targeted consolidation. We expect the budget to announce total expenditure growth of 11.1 per cent YoY in FY25. In level terms, we expect spending to increase to Rs 49.35 trillion, compared with Rs 47.66 trillion budgeted in February.

Where can the govt increase allocations?

While the major subsidies – for food, fertilizer and petroleum – are expected to remain unchanged, according to Barclays, the increase in revenue expenditure will likely be allocated to the government’s core programs, largely those that focus on rural areas. “The government’s flagship programs, including cash handouts to farmers (PM-KISAN), rural employment (MGNREGS), affordable housing (PM Awas Yojana) and rural road upgrading (PMGSY)3 have mostly had their allocations reduced since FY21-22; therefore, we believe some increase in expenditure for these schemes is likely. These programs also could support rural demand, which has been subdued for nearly a year,” Barclays maintained. That said, the government is unlikely to announce any big bang reforms/schemes that would need higher spending over the longer term and hinder fiscal consolidation.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectation-fiscal-consolidation-to-continue-but-may-see-shift-in-spending-mix-says-barclays-3554403/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: Why India must increase its healthcare budget to tackle climate crisis,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Nirmala Sitharaman is all set to announce the Union Budget 2024-25 on July 23. Climate change continues to be a growing threat to human health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), climate change is directly contributing to humanitarian emergencies from heatwaves, wildfires, floods, tropical storms and hurricanes and they are increasing in scale, frequency and intensity.

Research shows that 3.6 billion people already live in areas highly susceptible to climate change. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress alone.

It is important to highlight that the direct damage costs to health (excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as agriculture and water and sanitation) are estimated to be between US$ 2–4 billion per year by 2030, as per WHO.



As a country whose population faces several socio-economic vulnerabilities, India is more prone to exposure to climate change impacts.

During the Interim Budget 2024, unveiled plans for the launch of Blue Economy 2.0, which is focused at promoting climate-resilient activities and sustainable development in coastal areas. She also said that India will solarise the rooftops of 10 million households and provide viability gap funding for harnessing offshore wind energy potential with an initial capacity of one gigawatt to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.

The Interim Budget 2024 had a larger allocation and included announcements highlighting a focus on mitigation measures. Meanwhile, public health experts maintain that there is a need to increase investments in health systems with a focus on climate adaptability.

“Already healthcare is stretched beyond means. Investments need to go towards health systems being adaptable to climate and especially extreme weather events. Clean Cooling, flood and earthquake adaptive, consistent quality energy and transportation are all under invested areas. In addition, investments in robust collaborative surveillance systems will act as an insurance to the current health system in defending against poly-crises,” Dr. Angela Chaudhuri, Chief Catalyst of Swasti and a public health specialist told Financial Express.com.

Meanwhile, Himanshu Sikka, Project Director, SAMRIDH and Chief Strategy and Diversification Officer, IPE Global revealed that as global temperatures continue to rise, India faces an imminent surge in public health challenges that will exert unprecedented pressure on our already strained healthcare system.

“Heatwaves, becoming more frequent and intense, not only significantly reduce productivity but also pose life-threatening risks such as heat strokes. The warming climate, coupled with increased flooding and rising sea levels, is altering the transmission patterns of various infectious diseases. Vector-borne illnesses like dengue and malaria are expanding their geographical reach, while water-borne diseases are seeing more frequent outbreaks in flood-affected areas. Furthermore, the impact on agriculture due to changing weather patterns threatens food security and nutrition, potentially increasing rates of malnutrition and related health issues,” Sikka told Financial Express.com.

With only 30 percent of medical resources available to over half the population residing in rural areas, we stand at the tipping point, he said. According to WHO, All aspects of health are affected by climate change, from clean air, water and soil to food systems and livelihoods.

Further delay in tackling climate change will increase health risks, undermine decades of improvements in global health, and contravene the collective commitments to ensure the human right to health for all, the global health agency states.

“There’s an urgent need to propel digital health infrastructure in these underserved regions to maximize coverage and ensure utmost support to the existing facilities. While increasing government healthcare spending is imperative, it alone is insufficient. The need of the hour is to attract private players and commercial capital to the sector, bridging existing gaps in areas where low-profit margins deter private service providers. The government must, therefore, chart the course for blended and innovative finance mechanisms to catalyze investments in healthcare,” he told Financial Express.com.

According to Sikka, by strategically unlocking avenues for innovative finance, the government can drive sustainable innovation and lay a solid foundation for resilient, low-emitting, and adaptive healthcare infrastructure capable of withstanding future climate shocks.

“With decisive action now, universal health coverage may well be within reach,” he added.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) highlights that 3.6 billion people already live in areas highly susceptible to climate change. In vulnerable regions, the death rate from extreme weather events in the last decade was 15 times higher than in less vulnerable ones, the panel found.

It is noteworthy that climate change is impacting health in several ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-why-india-must-increase-its-healthcare-budget-to-tackle-climate-crisis-3554396/

With the government embarking on its third term, anticipation is mounting as the country gears up for the much-awaited Union Budget of 2024.

While the Interim Budget provided some respite to taxpayers by waiving outstanding demands of up to INR 25,000 for Assessment Year 2010-11 and earlier, and up to INR 10,000 for Assessment Year 2011-12 to 2015-16, it did not introduce any changes to personal tax rates. Consequently, expectations are running high among various segments of society, particularly the salaried class, who are looking at the upcoming Budget to ease their financial burden through a reduction in taxes.



In Budget 2023, the government introduced some changes in the new tax regime to make it more attractive amongst taxpayers such as increasing the maximum amount of income not chargeable to tax from INR 2.5 lakh to INR 3 lakh, allowing standard deduction of INR 50,000, widening of slab with lower tax rates, reduction of surcharge for income over INR 5 crore and an increase in the income threshold for rebate, from INR 5 lakh to INR 7 lakh.



The above changes have indeed encouraged taxpayers to switch to the new tax regime, but the shift is still not as expected by the government. Therefore, making the new regime more appealing to taxpayers could be a focus area for the government in this Budget. Taxpayers are looking for relief in the form of higher standard deduction, reduced tax rates, and wider tax slabs, expecting to benefit the middle-income group through this Budget. It is expected that authorities may consider reducing the highest tax rate of 30% to 25% under the new tax regime and increase the standard deduction from the current threshold of INR 50,000.

Further, the government may want to phase out the old regime and may also plan to increase the threshold limit for the highest tax rate from INR 10 lakh to INR 20 lakh, under the old tax regime, and increase the limit of 80C as an interim measure.

House Rent Allowance (HRA) is a significant component of an individual’s salary, allowing those living in rented accommodation to claim an exemption. The current exemption is capped at 50% of the basic salary for metro cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, and 40% for other cities. The current definition of metro cities under the law does not encompass the National Capital Region (NCR) and other large cities. Since many individuals live in areas such as Noida and Gurugram on the outskirts of Delhi, including NCR in the definition of metro cities could greatly benefit them. With this change, these individuals would be eligible to claim an HRA exemption of up to 50% of their basic salary, compared to the current 40% limit. Additionally, considering Bengaluru’s rapid growth, granting it metro city status could render the working class eligible for a 50% deduction for House Rent Allowance, potentially easing their tax impact.

Besides the tax rates and benefits, the government may also plan to rationalise some of the income tax processes and procedures. Currently, tax payments in India can be made through various modes such as net banking, debit cards, NEFT/RTGS, and over-the-bank counter. However, these are possible with an Indian bank only, which makes it difficult for a non-resident taxpayer to make tax payments. Non-resident taxpayers who need to deposit tax would benefit if they are allowed to pay taxes from their overseas bank accounts.

With the introduction of e-filing of tax returns, efficiencies in time and effort have been brought in the last mile connectivity of e-filing is the e-verification process; however, it has restricted means such as having accounts with net banking/demat facilities with specified banks, Aadhaar OTP to India mobile numbers, digital signature certificates, etc. Non-resident individuals living outside India who need to complete the tax return filing process, could benefit if the e-verification process can be extended via OTP to foreign mobile numbers or having two-factor authentication (different OTPs for foreign mobile numbers and email addresses). This would reduce paperwork and administrative tasks, such as tracking the receipt by the tax office and applying for condonation of delays. Alternatively, the time limit of 30 days should be extended to at least 60 days to facilitate verification through physical mode.

The above expectations, if met, would be a welcome relief for taxpayers, especially at middle income level. At the same time, these changes would be in line with the thinking of the government to simplify the law and the processes for the benefit of taxpayers. We will have to wait and see how the Finance Minister meets the expectations of taxpayers.

Markets continued their uptrend, gaining over half a percent due to favorable cues. Despite a subdued start, the Nifty remained range-bound for most of the week, with buoyancy in the final session leading to decent gains.

The Nifty closed at 24,502, up by 0.73%. Sectorally, FMCG, IT, and pharma were top performers, while metal, realty, and auto sectors saw profit-taking. The broader indices paused after their significant performance and settled flat.

In the coming week, attention will be on earnings and Union Budget updates, likely increasing volatility. Global cues, particularly from the US market where the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) reached a new high, are encouraging.



Having surpassed the 24,500 hurdle, the Nifty could aim for the 25,000 mark if it can sustain that level. In the event of profit booking, we expect the index to respect the 23,900-24,250 zone. Despite the overall positivity, increased volatility during the earnings season and budget-related discussions are normal.

Hence, a hedged approach is advisable, especially for overnight leveraged positions, along with careful monitoring of position sizes.

We recommend focusing on IT, energy, FMCG, and pharma for long trades. For themes like railways, defense, and other select PSUs, which have seen significant recent gains, traders should maintain extra caution and suggest trailing stop losses on the rise.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectation: Tax holiday and GST exemption top Space sector’s Budget wishlist,"The Indian Space Association (ISpA), representing the country’s private space companies, has submitted a series of recommendations for the Union Budget 2024-25. These suggestions aim to enhance the financial and overall health of India’s burgeoning space industry. The focus is on providing financial incentives and strategic government support to propel the sector forward.

Key Recommendations



1. Expansion of GST Exemptions

ISpA advocates for expanding the GST exemption currently applied to satellite launch services. They suggest including other critical components such as ground systems and launch vehicles. The exemption reduces GST costs on satellite launch services but does not address the input tax credit on procurement of goods and services. ISpA recommends similar exemptions for procuring key goods and services for satellite launch services. This approach would reduce GST input tax credit costs and benefit the entire supply chain.



2. Tax Holidays and Custom-Duty Exemptions

With space industrial parks planned across various states and significant greenfield investments by both legacy and start-up non-government entities, ISpA urges the government to introduce tax holidays and exemptions for space sector firms. Additionally, they propose concessions on customs duties for notified imports to alleviate the financial burden on these companies.

3. Reduction of Tax-rate on Interest on Foreign Borrowings

Given the capital-intensive nature of the space industry, involving activities like research and development, satellite manufacturing, and constructing satellite launch and earth stations, ISpA recommends lowering the tax rate on interest on foreign borrowings to 5%. This measure would facilitate easier access to necessary foreign funding at cost-effective interest rates for project financing.

4. Reduced Withholding Tax for Satellite Sector

The current withholding tax rate on payments to Indian companies providing satellite services is set at 10 percent under section 194J of the Income-tax Act, 1961. ISpA recommends reducing this rate to 2%, considering the low-profit margins in the satellite sector. This measure would enhance the profitability and sustainability of satellite operators.

5. Extension of PLI to Space-grade Components

Ensuring self-reliance is a key objective behind opening the sector for private participation. ISpA draws inspiration from the PLI scheme for drones and suggests introducing a similar scheme for space-grade components. This would incentivize domestic manufacturing under the ‘Make in India’ vision, bolster the supply chain for space-related technologies, and attract investment by providing financial incentives to manufacturers based on their output.



6. Government Commitment to Consume and Adapt NewSpace Sector

ISpA calls for a commitment from the government to procure and adopt space technology solutions across various governance areas, such as agriculture, disaster management, infrastructure planning and development monitoring, urban development, and remote area connectivity. This would provide a stable market for space tech firms and enhance the efficiency of public services.

In line with this, a Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and Digital Public Goods (DPG) approach for Earth observation-based geospatial analytics and insights can unlock value and innovation for several stakeholders beyond the space sector. A budget announcement for a DPI/DPG for earth observation would pave the way for democratizing access to space technology.

7. Reasonable Spectrum Usage Charges

Under the New Telecommunications Act 2023, spectrum for satellite applications is allocated through an administrative method. ISpA recommends reasonable Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC) as a percentage of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) for satellite services allocated non-auctioned spectrum under the new act. This approach would ensure that satellite operators are not overburdened with excessive fees.

8. Depreciation on One-Time Fees and Licence Charges for Satellite Operators

Satellite service providers in India may need to pay a one-time licence or spectrum fee to secure the licence to deliver satellite services and an annual licence fee based on revenue. ISpA proposes allowing 25% depreciation of the one-time fee and treating the annual fee as revenue expenditure. This approach would lower taxable profits and optimize the tax impact, supporting business operations.

A Vision for Growth



Lt Gen AK Bhatt (Retd.), Director General of ISpA, stated, “We believe that India’s focus on innovation and favourable regulatory environment will draw significant foreign direct investment, boosting economic growth and unlock the $44 billion opportunity, driving unprecedented economic progress and prosperity. With the implementation of the above reforms and initiatives, ISpA expects that enhanced investment and technological advancements will drive innovation, fostering a robust ecosystem for startups and established companies of the space industry.”

He emphasized the importance of the prompt implementation of the Space Activities Act to address legal and standards-related issues, providing a clear regulatory framework for the industry. With recent government reforms and initiatives and the guidelines for implementing the Indian Space Policy 2023 from IN-SPACe, the space sector is at a critical juncture towards becoming a global space power in the coming years.

ISpA’s comprehensive recommendations for the Union Budget 2024-25 reflect the potential for transformative growth in India’s space industry. By addressing financial, regulatory, and operational challenges, these measures aim to create a robust and competitive space sector that contributes significantly to the nation’s economy and technological advancement.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectation-tax-holiday-and-gst-exemption-top-space-sectors-budget-wishlist-3553877/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: A defining moment for India’s green economy,"By Raaja Kanwar

India is at a crucial juncture in its quest for sustainable development. The upcoming Union Budget 2024 offers a significant opportunity to push us further towards a greener future. For India to emerge as a global leader in the green economy, our government needs to emphasise sustainable growth, energy security, and environmental stewardship in its financial planning.

The green energy sector in India has already shown remarkable progress, largely due to initiatives like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and enhancing the competitiveness of Indian companies. Yet, to truly realize the potential of this sector, we must tackle key challenges and implement focused measures that encourage the widespread adoption of clean energy solutions.



One effective strategy would be to reduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on renewable energy components from 18% to 5%. This reduction would lower project costs, making investments more attractive and speeding up adoption. According to a study by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), this change could result in a 15% increase in renewable energy installations by 2030.

Encouraging foreign competition by opening the market to international module manufacturers would also foster innovation, reduce prices, and improve component quality. Currently, solar module prices in India are about 25-30% higher than global prices due to import restrictions and high tariffs. Creating a level playing field and promoting a competitive environment will ensure the sustainable growth of the green energy sector.

Additionally, lifting the requirement for procuring solar modules from the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) for the commercial and industrial sectors would be wise. Given the limited capacity of ALMM-approved companies and the lack of direct subsidies, relaxing this mandate would boost domestic production capacity and stimulate market growth.

Ensuring a reliable power supply and a stable grid is essential as India transitions to a greener future. Budget 2024 should prioritize incentives for Round-The-Clock (RTC) power projects and investments in battery storage. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) estimates India will need 27 GW of battery storage capacity by 2030 to meet its renewable energy targets.

These investments will spur private sector innovation, enhance grid resilience, and meet the nation’s growing energy demands. The commitment to investing over USD 360 billion in renewable energy infrastructure by 2030 is commendable. To achieve this target, Budget 2024 must allocate sufficient funds and introduce policies facilitating private sector participation. Innovative financing instruments like green bonds, which have raised over USD 21 billion as of February 2023, will be crucial in mobilizing capital for sustainable projects. The budget should also explore ways to make these financing options more accessible to investors.

A Call to Action

As we approach Budget 2024, we must ask ourselves: What kind of legacy do we want to leave for future generations? Will we seize this opportunity to lead the world in sustainable development, or will we falter in the face of challenges? The decisions we make now will shape our future. Budget 2024 is not just a financial plan; it’s a chance to redefine our nation’s priorities and set a course for a greener, more sustainable India. The time for action is now.

financialexpress.com,"Union Budget 2024: Why Standard Deduction limit needs to be increased to Rs 100,000!","The Union Budget 2024 is slated to be presented next week and a majority of taxpayers are concerned about whether the standard deduction limit will be raised in the upcoming budget or not.

It may be noted that salaried individuals are eligible for a standard deduction without having to provide evidence of actual expenses incurred. Under Section 16(ia) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, those filing their return of income under the old tax regime can claim a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 against their salary. The Finance Act 2023 extended this benefit to salaried individuals opting for the concessional tax regime u/s 115BAC of the Income Tax Act.

This deduction has been available for many years. However, it was removed in 2005, only to be reintroduced in the 2018 Union Budget. Initially set at Rs 40,000 in the Union Budget 2018, the standard deduction was later increased to Rs 50,000 in the Budget 2019. However, the increased limit of Rs 50,000 was limited to the old tax regime. In an effort to make the new tax regime more appealing, the Union Budget 2023 allowed a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 to taxpayers opting for the new regime as well.





However, the existing deduction of Rs 50,000 is considered inadequate to address the rising expenses linked to the increased cost of living and, therefore, it is imperative to raise the limit of this deduction.

Tax experts say the alignment would also result in equality with individuals generating revenue from business or profession, who have the option to either deduct actual expenses or choose a presumptive basis of taxation, where a specific percentage of gross income is deemed as an expense.

Additionally, “following the pandemic, there has been a rise in medical expenses, which should be taken into account when contemplating an elevation in the standard deduction. To tackle these issues, the government should contemplate raising the standard deduction limit to Rs 100,000 from the current 50,000,” says Divya Baweja, Partner, Deloitte India.

Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director, Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, says increase in standard deduction has been one of the important demands of the salaried taxpayer from the government. Though this has now been included under the simplified tax regime, which is the default regime, given that the salaried taxpayer is not eligible for most deductions / exemptions, increase in the limit of standard deduction is a key expectation. “Going by the trend in the past budgets, this however seems unlikely. But we could expect the basic exemption limit being increased from the existing Rs 300,000 to Rs 500,000,” she adds.



Sanjiv Malhotra, Senior Advisor, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, also says that there is a lot of talk about the FM considering to raise the standard deduction. If it happens, it will serve two purposes. One, the disposable income in the hands of the salaried class will go up and, second, it will further encourage more taxpayers to opt for the new tax regime.

“Year-on-year inflation requires tax relief to the salaried class. While relief may also come by enhancing the limits under various tax slabs; standard deduction creates some parity for wage earners, who unlike others are unable to claim to expenses in relation to their vocation,” he adds.

Thus, there is no doubt that there is a strong argument for increasing the standard deduction limit, regardless of the circumstances. It is anticipated that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will address this legitimate request from the salaried class in due course.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/union-budget-2004-why-standard-deduction-limit-needs-to-be-increased-to-rs-100000-3553321/

Experts appeal but will FM listen,"In a proactive appeal ahead of the Union budget on July 23, the All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (AIFTP) on Sunday urged the government for a substantial reduction in personal income tax for citizens. AIFTP President Narayan Jain passionately advocated for raising the exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh, aligning with the organization’s vision to alleviate the tax burden on the populace, a PTI report said. Jain proposed in his memorandum to the Finance Minister that income ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh should be subject to a 10% tax rate, while income from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh should face a 20% tax rate. For income exceeding Rs 20 lakh, Jain suggested a tax rate of 25%.

Calls intensify for higher tax exemption

Rajat Agrawal, CEO of Barista Coffee, highlights the potential impact of a proposed reduction in individual income tax rates, particularly targeting middle-income earners. He believes that such a move could significantly increase disposable incomes, thereby stimulating consumer spending. Agrawal emphasizes that higher disposable incomes would likely benefit businesses like Barista Coffee by potentially increasing customer spending on discretionary items such as coffee and dining experiences. This anticipated rise in consumer demand could also contribute to overall economic growth, as businesses across various sectors stand to benefit from increased consumer confidence and purchasing power. Agrawal’s perspective underscores the potential ripple effects of tax policy changes on both individual finances and broader economic activity.

Rahul M. Mishra, Co-founder and Director of Policy Ensure, emphasizes that his key expectations from the upcoming budget involve tax reforms aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of insurance products. He suggests revising tax structures, particularly by increasing the cap for insurance premium payments under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. This adjustment would encourage individuals to invest more in insurance, thereby expanding coverage. Additionally, Mishra advocates for a specific exemption for term insurance to mitigate the constraints posed by the Section 80C deduction limit.



Mayank Bhatnagar, Co-founder and COO of FinEdge, anticipates several key changes in the upcoming tax regime. He suggests raising the basic tax exemption limit from Rs. 3,00,000/- to Rs. 5,00,000/- and potentially increasing the standard deduction to put more money in taxpayers’ hands. Bhatnagar also proposes an enhancement of tax exemption limits under Section 80C and Section 80D. To encourage retirement savings, he recommends additional tax deductions for investments in schemes like the National Pension System (NPS).

Furthermore, Bhatnagar emphasizes the need for financial inclusion measures targeted at women, including special tax-saving schemes and incentives for female investors. These initiatives, he believes, would foster a more diverse and inclusive investment environment.

This highly anticipated budget is the first from the BJP-led NDA government following its re-election for a third term in the recently declared Lok Sabha Election results on June 4.

It is expected to outline the government’s vision for economic growth, development, and fiscal policies. The budget presentation will commence at 11 am in the Lok Sabha and will be broadcast live on various platforms apart from national broadcaster Doordarshan. Although it is now customary for the budget to be presented at 11 am, this was not always the case.

When the Union Budget timings were changed from 5:00 pm to 11:00 am

As late as 1999, the Union Budget used to be tabled in Parliament at 5:00 pm. This was a practice that continued since the colonial regime. It is said that the 5:00 pm slot was fixed by the British government as it used to help them to make the budgetary announcements simultaneously India as well as in London.



With India being 5 hours 30 minutes ahead of the United Kingdom, the 5:00 pm slot in New Delhi meant 11:30 am GMT. This made it very convenient for the Raj era to consult and coordinate the budgetary announcements.

The 5:00 pm timings remained a budget tradition and the subsequent Indian governments used to present the Union Budget at 5:00 pm. However, in a historic move, the then Union Finance Minister changed the budget timings and presented the financial statement in Parliament at 11:00 am. There were two reasons for the move. First, ending a colonial era practice and second, more time given to MPs and officials to understand and debate the budgetary announcements.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-time-why-union-budget-timings-were-changed-from-500-pm-to-1100-am-3551854/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: Govt likely to introduce amendments to Banking Regulation Act to push banking sector reforms,"In order to advance reforms in the banking industry, the government is likely to introduce amendments to Banking Regulation Act 1949 and other laws during the upcoming Budget Session. Apart from this, amendments in the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970, and the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1980 are needed for privatisation of public sector banks, PTI reports, citing sources.

These Acts caused banks to be nationalised in two stages, and in order to privatise banks, certain aspects of these laws must be amended. Amendments, if approved by Parliament, would help bring down government holding in state-owned banks below 51 per cent, improve bank governance and enhance investors’ protection, the sources said.

The Parliament session beginning on July 22 would witness the Budget presentation on July 23 and conclude with the passage of the Finance Bill on August 12.



It is to be noted that the government had listed amendments to these laws to be taken up during the winter session in 2021, but these bills could not be tabled. “To effect amendments in Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Acts, 1970 and 1980 and incidental amendments to Banking Regulation Act, 1949 in the context of Union Budget announcement 2021 regarding privatisation of two Public Sector Banks,” as per the list of legislative business for the winter session.



Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Budget for 2021-22, announced the privatisation of public sector banks (PSBs). “Other than IDBI Bank, we propose to take up the privatisation of two PSBs and one general insurance company in 2021-22,” she had said.

In order to guarantee the privatisation of a general insurance company, the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021 was approved by Parliament during the monsoon session that concluded in August of that same year.

The overall number of PSBs decreased from 27 in March 2017 to 12 in April 2020 when the government combined 10 PSBs into four.



According to the amalgamation plan, Punjab National Bank amalgamated with United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce, creating the second-largest PSB. Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank amalgamated, and Indian Bank absorbed Allahabad Bank. The Union Bank of India was formed by the merger of Corporation Bank and Andhra Bank.

In a first three-way merger, Bank of Baroda merged Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with itself in 2019. SBI had merged five of its associate banks, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Hyderabad and Bharatiya Mahila Bank effective April 2017.

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Diagnostics leaders demand utilisation of resources, local manufacturing of equipments","Budget 2024 Expectations: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is all set to announce the Union Budget 2024-25 on July 23. Ahead of the Union Budget 2024, leaders from the diagnostics industry are expecting new strategic initiatives and more investments.

Dhiraj Jain, Founder & Chairman of Redcliffe Labs, told Financial Express.com that as a contributor to the healthcare sector, he is looking forward to the Indian Union Budget’s strong commitment to transforming it, with accessibility and affordability at its core.

“India’s healthcare sector had a remarkable year in 2023, with significant mergers and acquisitions, consolidation, significant private equity investments, a notable upswing in stock prices, and improved financial performance. This growth, culminating in a valuation of $372 billion, was not solely the result of the private sector’s dynamism but also the government’s strategic initiative, which played a crucial role in the sector’s triumph,” Jain told Financial Express.com.



This success story should serve as a compelling case for further investment and commitment in the healthcare sector, highlighting the government’s significant influence on the sector’s success, he said.

“Looking ahead to the post-pandemic era, it is crucial to bolster the economy by strengthening and preparing the healthcare infrastructure. This is not just a matter of ensuring people have improved access to quality and critical healthcare services, but also a strategic move to secure a brighter future. The Union Budget 2023-2024, with its potential to ignite innovation, drive R&D, and boost healthcare expenditures, could be a pivotal investment into future human capital, which will be the foundation for an efficient and resilient healthcare sector,” Jain told Financial Express.com.

The urgency and necessity of this investment are paramount and cannot be overstated, he added.

He also urged the government to implement zero-rating GST on healthcare services.

“Implementing this change will further ensure eligibility for input tax credits and also help to reduce the cost of essential services. Healthcare providers can pass the services to patients at lower prices leading to better health outcomes for the underserved. This will help in expanding the services to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities apart from urban areas, and most importantly shift the focus of the public from curative care to preventive care which is necessary for a Healthier Bharat,” Jain told Financial Express.com.

Meanwhile, Surajit Chakrabartty, CFO, MedGenome maintained that the healthcare sector in India has made significant scientific and technological progress over the past two decades.

“The advent of genomics in clinical research and clinical care has been a key driver of this progress. Through the identification of mutations responsible for complex diseases, genomics has revolutionized disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Increased awareness of the application and benefits of genomics, specifically genetic testing, is driving increased adoption amongst healthcare practitioners. However, public awareness is also crucial for the widespread adoption and success of genetic testing in India. We urge the Government of India to lead awareness campaigns to educate and build trust in genetic testing,” Chakrabartty told Financial Express.com.

Further, through effective utilization of resources and fostering public-private collaborations, India can advance the adoption of genomics in various clinical applications and make it accessible to the wider population, he said.

“This includes funding large-scale studies on rare diseases, integrating prenatal genetic testing into maternity benefits, and raising awareness about rare disorders and available support for patients and their families. For sustained progress and a robust genomics infrastructure, establishing comprehensive regulatory guidelines and ethical frameworks is essential. This will enhance the competitiveness and investment in the industry and further strengthen India’s healthcare ecosystem,” he told Financial Express.com.

Moreover, Venkata Suman Cherukuri, Chairman and MD, TRUSTlab Diagnostics highlighted that the healthcare industry in India is one of the neglected sectors.

“In this budget, the industry is looking forward to integrated technology into healthcare services, emphasizing on digital health records, and remote monitoring to enhance service delivery and accessibility. We urge the new government to prioritize optimizing high end radiology and diagnostics plans to ensure high-quality, positive, and impactful results,” Cherukuri told Financial Express.com.

Increased budget allocation for screening and diagnostic programs for deadly diseases such as cancer and cardiac ailments is essential, he said.

“Investing in the proper induction and training of frontline doctors, nurses, and allied healthcare workers will help elevate the quality of healthcare sector. Lowering customs duty on imported diagnostic equipment and adjusting high GST rates on lab supplies will improve efficiencies and foster R&D investments. Focusing on local manufacturing of the diagnostics equipment and various testing kits will help us curb the cost we pay for the imported goods and thrives to generate opportunities for our healthcare professionals to improve the existing technologies and healthcare devices in comparatively lower costs. More labs and R&D centers should be developed to enhance the quality of results in a shorter span of time,” he emphasised

Cherukuri also pointed out that the burden of filing GST is immense for an industry already facing intense competition in a country like India.

“The government should consider eliminating GST on all medical purchases. Since patients are not charged with it, removing GST on the purchase of diagnostic materials and lab supplies would provide significant relief and motivation for this industry,” he said.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-diagnostics-leaders-demand-utilisation-of-resources-local-manufacturing-of-equipments-3551864/

As the name suggests, this event involves preparation of the Indian sweet dish in a large ‘kadhai’ at the North Block. The finance minister stirs the ‘kadhai’ and the halwa is served to everyone. This tradition is also a way to acknowledge the hard work of all the finance ministry officials. The halwa ceremony heralds the process of printing of all the budget documents ahead of the presentation in Parliament.



Why halwa ceremony is so important?

The halwa ceremony is a significant event as it also marks the beginning of lockdown at the finance ministry. This means no official is allowed to leave the ministry compound. Everyone part of the Budget team is allowed to leave only after the financial document is presented in Parliament. The printing of the Union Budget inside the basement located at the North Block has become a permanent feature since 1980.

These stringent measures date back to a leak that occurred in 1950. A portion of the Union Budget was leaked while it was being printed at Rashtrapati Bhawan. As a result of the leak, the then Finance Minister, John Matthai, resigned. Since 1980, the North Block basement has been designated as the permanent location for budget printing.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-whats-the-halwa-ceremony-and-why-is-it-so-important-for-budget-preparation-find-out-3551674/

Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Key Expectations of EV Battery & Recycling Sector

The upcoming Budget 2024 in India is expected to emphasise sustainability while addressing various sectoral demands and maintaining economic far-sightedness.

Prassann Daphal , CEO at Recyclekaro reveals key expectations of EV Battery and Recycling Sector:

- Reduction in GST: The Goods and Services Tax (GST) on waste lithium-ion batteries is expected to be lowered from 18 to 5 per cent, in line with the GST rate on lead-acid batteries, which is a significant anticipation.

- Extension of FAME II Scheme: Stakeholders in the industry are pushing for the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) program to be extended and possibly expanded. This extension is essential to sustaining the momentum behind EV adoption and encouraging battery recycling.

The government's goal of having 30 per cent electric vehicles on the road by 2030 will only be met with the expansion of the FAME program, which the electric vehicle industry is pressing for.

- Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme: With the support of this program, the recycling industry would be encouraged to grow and make a substantial contribution to India's sustainability objectives. The government may support the expansion of the industry by expanding the PLI plan to include the whole value chain, from manufacture to recycling.

- Incentives for Green Energy Projects: It is anticipated that the budget would include further incentives for renewable energy initiatives, such as battery recycling, which is essential to the clean energy transition and the circular economy. It is envisaged that there would be incentives for creative waste management systems and simplified recycling rules.

- Investment in R&D: Another crucial expectation is higher funding for research and development of battery recycling infrastructure and technologies. Improving domestic battery recycling capabilities and lab space can help the local industry expand while lowering reliance on imports.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-live-updates-date-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-speech-budget-expectations-3551353/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Which medicines are more likely to get expensive after Sitharaman’s announcement?,"Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024-25 on July 23. Ahead of the Union Budget 2024 announcement, industry leaders are expecting new policy reforms, price relaxation, GST reduction, and announcement of major schemes.

In April this year, Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya announced that there would be no increase in the prices of essential medicines for this fiscal year due to negligible growth in wholesale price-based inflation. How the Union Budget 2024 announcement will affect the prices of medicines?

Dr. Sujit Paul, Group CEO, Zota Healthcare Ltd. told Financial Express.com a number of variables impacting the pharmaceutical sector will eventually cause the price of prescription medications to rise.



“First, we anticipate an increase in the cost of drugs that significantly rely on imported Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs). Since changes in import prices have a direct effect on manufacturing costs, which also cover a broad range of specialty and in-demand pharmaceuticals. Secondly, drugs that are freshly developed and patented come with significant Research, development and production costs,” Dr. Paul said.

Changes in production costs or regulatory changes may result in an increase in the price of certain medications, he said.

“Biologics and advanced therapeutics are two other categories that are susceptible to price rise since they require complex technologies and advanced production techniques. We believe that the cost of medications that depend on imported APIs, newly produced pharmaceuticals, patents, biologics, and advanced therapies will increase as the industry works through these difficulties,” Dr. Paul told Financial Express.com.

Meanwhile, Dr Shuchin Bajaj, Founder & Director Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals informed that the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) enforced a slight increase in the prices of essential medicines starting April 1, 2024.

“This adjustment, reflecting a 0.00551% rise in the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) for scheduled formulations, affects several drugs. Painkillers such as Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, Mefenamic acid, Paracetamol, and Morphine are now more expensive. Similarly, prices have increased for anti-TB medicines like Amikacin, Bedaquiline, and Clarithromycin, as well as anticonvulsants like Clobazam, Diazepam, and Lorazepam,” Dr. Bajaj told Financial Express.com.

Additionally, the Centre has fixed higher prices for drugs treating diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, bacterial infections, and allergies, he said.

However, prices for many commonly prescribed diabetes drugs, including metformin, linagliptin, and sitagliptin, have been stabilized at ₹15 to ₹20 per tablet.

“Consequently, while some prices have increased, others have been reduced or stabilized. Going forward, we expect the budget to focus on pharmaceutical pricing and further reduce the costs of essential drugs to make them more affordable for a mass population,” Dr. Bajaj told Financial Express.com.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-which-medicines-are-more-likely-to-get-expensive-after-sitharamans-announcement-3550385/

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectation: Economic vision, political theme key aspects to watch in Budget, says Nomura","A Japanese brokerage emphasised that the upcoming Union budget will be crucial for monitoring the new government’s economic vision and its handling of the political landscape. They also projected muted returns on the equities market in the second half of the year and maintained their year-end Nifty target at 24,860 points, indicating a modest increase of approximately 3 per cent from current levels.

As the government has pledged to bring the fiscal deficit down to 4.6 per cent by FY26, Aurodeep Nandi, the India economist at Nomura, told that another important topic to watch is the fiscal glide path. Nandi further emphasised that gaining an understanding of the incoming government’s economic agenda will be a crucial area to monitor, citing the 100-day plans of the government that were created by several ministries prior to the elections.

He added that following the election defeat, people will be closely observing the political theme of the incoming government’s budget, which is depending on coalition partners. Nandi stated that particular attention will be paid to how the next administration handles the demands from partners Janata Dal and TDP, which are based in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, respectively.



Nandi further added that the demands being made by the allies could result in increased borrowing, direct handouts to citizens and local infrastructure spending. Concerns over increased social sector spending are becoming more and more prevalent. He emphasised that there is no fiscal risk associated with this, citing Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s recent comment that saturation levels had been achieved.

He said the government has over-delivered by reducing the fiscal deficit to 5.6 per cent in FY24 as against the budgeted 5.8 per cent, and also has the comfort of the record Rs 2.1 lakh crore of dividend from the RBI. The final budget can also opt for reducing the fiscal deficit marginally to 5 per cent from the interim budget target of 5.1 per cent, he said.

Nandi mentioned recent reports indicating a review of income taxes and stated that the government would possibly consider boosting economic consumption. He also pointed out that the way the government handles the manufacturing theme will be closely observed, adding that this may involve raising expenditures and extending the production-linked incentive programme to electronic components.

On the equity markets front, the brokerage’s head of equity research Saion Mukherjee said narratives are driving the market at present and most investors are not too bothered by the concerns on valuations. The current rally is completely fuelled by domestic money, and the foreign investors are on the sidelines, he said, adding that higher IPO activity in the second half of the year can help.

Higher IPO activity will reduce the valuations, he said, explaining that at present, a higher quantum of money is chasing a limited set of options and as the options increase, it will go to other scrips and help get some sanity. The foreign investors are chasing newer themes like artificial intelligence and the surge in Japanese markets, it said.

Mukherjee said the brokerage is overweight on financial stocks, capital goods and power, and underweight on auto and consumer discretionary sectors.

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectation: Call for making education affordable, GST exemption grows louder","All eyes are on Budget 2024 due to be tabled on July 23. While every sector has its unique wishlist, calls for GST exemption on all educational expenses has been gaining momentum. Ranging from test preparation courses to job-oriented skill programmes, specifically targeting students from Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Low Income Group (LIG) families, industry stakeholders are keen about making education more accessible and affordable.

Prateek Maheshwari, Co-Founder of Physics Wallah and Chair of the India EdTech Consortium (IEC), emphasised, “The existing 18% tax slab is disproportionately high for something as fundamental as education. Such financial relief would significantly reduce the net disposable income spent by these families on education, making quality education more accessible.”

Partnerships and economic alignment in edu-fintech

Experts suggest that partnerships between fintech companies and educational institutions are essential for driving skill development. The education budget can further invigorate the industry by aligning educational progress with economic demands. “This involves equipping the workforce with crucial digital financial skills, offering tax reliefs and subsidies to lower operational costs and boosting funding for research and development. Moreover, grants for training and professional development are vital for fostering innovation within the edu-fintech sector,” said Rohit Gajbhiye, CEO and Founder of LEO1.



Green skilling and technological advancements

In an era defined by the urgent need for sustainable development, experts believe the government must actively encourage the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in green skilling and establish Green Skill Academies across various states. Manav Subodh, Founder of 1M1B (One Million for One Billion), stated, “This strategic initiative aims to equip one crore youth with green skills by 2025, seamlessly integrating these programmes with the Skill India Mission. By doing so, not only will it create a multitude of jobs within the rapidly expanding green economy, but it will also significantly contribute to India’s climate commitments.”

Subodh reiterated the need for the education budget to create a dedicated fund and provide incentives for climate technology and AI startups. Establishing AI hubs and centres of excellence focused on open-source AI is crucial for democratising access and enabling the development of indigenous use cases that address local sustainability challenges in sectors like transportation, agriculture, and energy efficiency.

financialexpress.com,Nirmala Sitharaman all set to present Budget 2024: Here are 10 lesser-known facts about Union Budget,"The Budget 2024 is no doubt the most talked about economic event for the country. Budget 2024 expectations are doing the rounds and all eyes are on July 23 when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharan will be tabling the Budget. While it is common knowledge that by tabling this Budget, she will hold the record for presenting maximum budgets in a row, there are many intriguing and lesser-known facts about the Budget. Here are 10 lesser-known facts:

1. Budget Tradition

India has a long trradition of presenting the Budget and dates back to the 19th century. The inaugural Indian Budget was introduced on February 18, 1869, by James Wilson, a Scottish economist and politician. This marked the formal inception of financial planning and taxation policies under British rule, following the introduction of the idea of the Indian Budget by the East India Company on April 7, 1860.



After independence, India’s first post-colonial Finance Budget was delivered on November 26, 1947, by RK Shanmukham Chetty. The first budget of India as a Republic, distinct from colonial-era practices, was presented on February 28, 1950, by John Mathai, setting the stage for modern budgetary practices in independent India.



2. The Briefcase Tradition

One of the most iconic symbols of the Union Budget is the briefcase carried by the Finance Minister on Budget Day. This tradition dates back to the colonial era. In 2019, Piyush Goyal, who presented the interim Budget, was the last finance minister to carry a suitcase. After that, Nirmala Sitharaman, in her first Budget speech came up with ‘bahi-khata’ concept, saying it was “high time to move on from British hangover”. In a post-Covid scenario India has steadily moved to a digital Budget.

3. Halwa Ceremony

Before the printing of the Union Budget document begins, a ritual called the “Halwa Ceremony” takes place at the Ministry of Finance. Halwa (a sweet dish) is prepared and served to all those involved in the budget-making process, signifying the beginning of the lock-in period where officials are isolated to prevent leaks.

4. Budget Time

The long-standing colonial tradition of presenting the Union Budget at 5 PM was broken by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government when then Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha presented the Budget at 11 AM. Since then, all successive governments have presented the Budget at 11 AM.

5. Budget Papers Colour

The colour of the budget papers alternates every year between red and black. Red is used for the regular budget and black for the interim budget. This tradition dates back to colonial times.

6. Idea of adopting GST

The concept of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India predates its formal introduction in 2017. Although GST was first implemented on July 1, 2017, by then-Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, its origins traced back to earlier proposals. The idea of adopting GST was initially put forward in 2000 during the tenure of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government.

The term “GST” also found mention in the Budget speech of P. Chidambaram on February 28, 2006, when he served as the Finance Minister under the UPA II regime. The primary objective behind proposing GST was to establish a unified tax regime across the country, aiming to streamline and simplify India’s complex taxation structure.

7. Making a new record

Finance Minister and BJP leader Nirmala Sitharaman will make history by presenting the Union Budget 2024-25 in Parliament on July 23. This achievement will distinguish her as the first finance minister of India to deliver seven consecutive Union Budgets, surpassing Morarji Desai’s previous record of six. Morarji Desai, who held the position of India’s finance minister from 1959 to 1964, previously set a significant milestone with five full Budgets and one interim Budget. His tenure established a longstanding record in Indian financial history, maintaining the highest number of budgets presented by any finance minister for over fifty years.

8. Railways Budget merged with Union Budget

In 2017, the Rail Budget was merged with the Union Budget. This change, initiated by then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, shifted the traditional presentation date of the Budget from the end of February to February 1st. The objective was to streamline the budgetary process, enhance efficiency, and foster the overall development of both the Railways and the Indian economy.

9. Longest and shortest speeches

Dr. Manmohan Singh’s 1991 budget speech, which quoted Victor Hugo stretched to an impressive 18,650 words. This speech remains renowned for its depth and detail in addressing economic matters.

In contrast, HM Patel delivered the shortest budget speech on record in 1977, containing a concise 800 words during the presentation of the Interim Budget. Not only was it brief in content, but it also set a record for brevity in budget speeches.

When it comes to the duration of budget presentations, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, set a notable record with her 2020-21 Budget speech delivered on February 1, 2020. It lasted for two hours and 42 minutes. Despite her extensive coverage of various fiscal measures and policies, time constraints required her to curtail the speech abruptly with two pages left unfinished.

Conversely, Pranab Mukherji delivered the shortest budget speech in terms of time, making his 1982 presentation notably succinct.

10. Not just FMs, PMs have also delivered Budget

While it is traditionally the finance minister’s role to present the Union Budget in India, there have been noteworthy occasions when the prime minister assumed this responsibility. Jawaharlal Nehru became the first prime minister to present the Union Budget in 1958. This unusual circumstance arose when then-Finance Minister TT Krishnamachari resigned amid controversy, prompting Nehru to step in and deliver the budget address.

In subsequent occurrences, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi took on the Budget presentation in 1970 following the resignation of Finance Minister Morarji Desai, who protested the nationalisation of 14 Indian private banks without prior consultation. Similarly, in the fiscal year 1987-88, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi presented the Budget when Finance Minister VP Singh resigned.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/nirmala-sitharaman-all-set-to-present-budget-2024-here-are-10-lesser-known-facts-about-union-budget-3549799/

Expectations are high for the first full Budget of Modi 3.0, alliance partners TDP and JD(U) have sought special focus from Sitharaman.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 expectations: What Nirmala Sitharaman can do for the solar energy sector,"By Tanmoy Duari

The government has been making significant strides towards promoting renewable energy. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s upcoming Union Budget 2024 presents a pivotal opportunity to further boost the solar energy sector. Here’s what we believe could make a substantial impact:

Tax and Duty Reforms

One of the major expectations from the Union Budget 2024 is the rationalisation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on solar equipment. Reducing the GST on solar panels and components from 13.8% to 5% would make solar investments more attractive and affordable. This change could significantly lower the cost of solar projects, encouraging more widespread adoption across the country​.



Increased Budget Allocation

The recent increase in budget estimates for grid-based solar power from Rs 4,757 crore to Rs 10,000 crore is a positive step. However, continuing this trend with more financial support can help accelerate the installation of solar power systems, particularly in the rooftop segment. Enhanced funding can drive substantial growth and help achieve national renewable energy targets.

Support for Domestic Manufacturing

To reduce dependency on imports and boost domestic production, it is crucial to extend incentives and subsidies to local manufacturers. Measures such as the reduction or removal of Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on imported solar cells and modules, and providing capital support for domestic manufacturing units, would be instrumental. This can enhance the competitiveness of Indian solar products in the global market​.



Innovative Financing Models

The introduction of innovative financing models is essential to ease the financial burden on solar developers and consumers. Subsidised interest rates, better access to working capital, and viability gap funding for offshore and large-scale solar projects can catalyze the growth of the sector. These financial incentives will enable more stakeholders to participate actively in the renewable energy transition.

Promotion of Rooftop Solar

The Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana, which aims to provide 300 units of free electricity to 10 million households through rooftop solar installations, is a commendable initiative. Further expanding and promoting such schemes can empower more households to adopt solar energy, leading to significant savings and contributing to India’s sustainability goals​.



These measures will not only enhance the growth of the solar sector but also contribute significantly to achieving India’s net-zero emissions target by 2070.

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: What is India’s ‘Viksit Bharat @ 2047’, roadmap – Explained","Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman outlined the government’s vision of ‘Viksit Bharat by 2047’ during the interim Budget 2024 presentation on February 1 and a comprehensive roadmap for achieving ‘Viksit Bharat’ – or developed India – will be unveiled in the full budget scheduled on July 23.

Earlier in February, she had highlighted that India has overcome challenges from the pre-2014 era through effective economic management and governance, which have steered the country towards sustained high growth. She attributed this success to the government’s sound policies, genuine intentions, and timely decisions.



What is ‘Viksit Bharat @ 2047’

‘Viksit Bharat,’ which translates to ‘developed India,’ aims to achieve a prosperous nation in harmony with nature, boasting modern infrastructure and providing opportunities for all citizens and regions to reach their full potential by 2047 – marking India’s 100 years of independence.



Sitharaman emphasised the government’s commitment for ensuring social justice through an inclusive development approach that covers all sections of society, regardless of caste or background.

She highlighted the importance of empowering marginalized groups such as the poor, women, youth, and farmers – known as the “four major castes” according to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s framework.

“Our government is working with an approach to development that is all-round, all-pervasive and all-inclusive. It covers all castes and people at all levels. We are working to make India a ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. For achieving that goal, we need to improve people’s capability and empower them,” she had said.

The Finance Minister had underscored the significance of ‘Sabka Prayas’ – or collective efforts – in realizing the aspirations of every Indian, reaffirming the government’s commitment to sustainable development and equitable growth as pillars of ‘Viksit Bharat.’

“Our vision for ‘Viksit Bharat’ is that of “Prosperous Bharat in harmony with nature, with modern infrastructure, and providing opportunities for all citizens and all regions to reach their potential”. With confidence arising from strong and exemplary track record of performance and progress earning ‘Sabka Vishwas’, the next five years will be years of unprecedented development, and golden moments to realize the dream of developed India @ 2047. The trinity of demography, democracy and diversity backed by ‘Sabka Prayas’ has the potential to fulfill aspirations of

every Indian,” she said.

Push for reforms

The Finance Minister, who is all set to create a record this time by presenting the Union Budget, had said that many growth and development-enabling reforms are needed in the states to realize the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’.

“A provision of seventy-five thousand crore rupees as fifty-year interest-free loan is proposed this year to support those milestone-linked reforms by the State Governments.

The Government will form a high-powered committee for an extensive consideration of the challenges arising from fast population growth and demographic changes. The committee will be mandated to make recommendations for addressing these challenges comprehensively in relation to the goal of ‘Viksit Bharat’, she said.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-what-is-indias-viksit-bharat-2047-roadmap-explained-3549847/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: No tax on annual income up to Rs 8.5 lakh if basic exemption hiked to Rs 5 lakh | Here are possible tax slab changes,"Union Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her first budget in the Modi 3.0 regime on July 23 in Parliament. Overall, this will be her seventh straight budget presentation with an interim one presented in February this year.

With just a fortnight to go before the Union Budget 2024, taxpayers, especially those in the middle-class, are hoping for some much-needed tax relief measures from the Modi government. They are particularly looking for the government to raise the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, increase the standard deduction limits, and introduce new deduction benefits under the new tax regime.

What are the deduction benefits available currently under new tax regime?

Currently, the new tax regime only offers a standard deduction benefit of Rs 50,000, with no other deductions and exemptions like those available under the old tax regime.



In the upcoming budget, experts too anticipate a significant change in the tax structure. They are of the view that the government may increase the basic tax exemption limit under the new tax regime from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh per annum.



What will be tax-free income under new tax regime if basic exemption limit hiked to Rs 5 lakh?

If this hike is implemented, it would mean that individuals with an annual income of up to Rs 8.5 lakh could potentially pay no income tax. This calculation takes into account the standard deduction and the rebate under section 87A, assuming it remains unchanged, feels CA Suresh Surana.

According to him, such a move would provide substantial relief to middle-income earners, significantly increasing the tax-free income limit and boosting disposable income for millions of taxpayers.

Income up to Rs 7.5 lakh is tax-free with Rs 3 lakh exemption and Section 87A rebate

Currently, with a Rs 3 lakh exemption limit, income up to Rs 7.5 lakh is tax-free after considering Standard Deduction and Rebate under section 87A.

Current tax slabs under the new tax regime:

Tax slabs Tax rate Up to Rs 3 lakh 0% Rs 3 lakh to Rs 6 lakh 5% (Tax rebate u/s 87A) Rs 6 lakh to Rs 9 lakh 10% (Tax rebate u/s 87A up to Rs 7 lakh) Rs 9 lakh to Rs 12 lakh 15% Rs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh 20% Above Rs 15 lakh 30%

Revised Tax Slabs (Assumed):

Tax slabs (assumed under new tax regime) Tax rate Up to Rs 5 lakh 0% Rs 5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh 5% (Tax rebate u/s 87A) Rs 6 lakh to Rs 9 lakh 10% (Tax rebate u/s 87A on income up to Rs 8 lakh) Rs 9 lakh to Rs 12 lakh 15% Rs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh 20% Rs 15 lakh and above 30%

Note: These are illustrative slabs to demonstrate how the adjustments might look with an increased exemption limit. Actual tax slabs and rates would depend on the government’s tax policy decisions.



Tax-free income limit with a Rs 3 lakh and Rs 5 lakh exemption limit:

Under the current scenario, with an exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh, the tax-free income limit includes several components. First, there is a standard deduction of Rs 50,000. Additionally, a tax rebate under section 87A is available, providing up to Rs 25,000 in relief if the taxable income is Rs 7 lakh or less. As a result, the taxable income up to which no tax is payable is Rs 7.5 lakh, factoring in the Rs 50,000 standard deduction.

Revised Scenario (Exemption Limit Rs 5 lakh):

In the revised scenario, with an increased exemption limit of Rs 5 lakh, the tax-free income limit changes significantly. The standard deduction remains at Rs 50,000. The tax rebate under section 87A would also need to be applicable, providing Rs 25,000 in relief if the taxable income is Rs 8 lakh or less. Consequently, the taxable income up to which no tax is payable would be Rs 8.5 lakh, including the Rs 50,000 standard deduction.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Will green power be a priority? Experts say incentives important,"Power, especially renewable power is expected to be a top priority for the Government. As India marches ahead with its COP 26 commitments and targets fulfilling 50% of energy needs through renewable power by 2030, it is important to note that the Budgetary allocations have to match the broader objectives. Most industry experts believe that apart from allocations to the sector, Govt needs to incentivise companies excelling in adopting sustainability and create instruments like Green bonds to pass on the benefit.

Allocations for sustainable power so far

During the Interim Budget Rs 28,352 crore was allocated to the power sector and this is a sharp 50 per cent increase from the revised estimate (RE) of Rs 18,945 crore for 2023-24. The Finance Minister announced solarisation of 10 million households via rooftop solar installations and viability gap funding (VGF) for offshore wind projects with a combined capacity of 1,000 MW.

The largest funding during the Interim Budget 2024 went to hydropower projects, the Bio Energy initiative, and the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM). These programmes aimed at reforming the power distribution industry also received a budgeted allocation increase of at least 39 per cent. The amount allotted for hydropower efforts is Rs 51 crore, a substantial increase of 155 per cent over the Rs 20 crore in the revised projection for FY24.



By December 2024, the 2,000 MW Subansiri Lower plant, which is presently under construction in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, should be completely operational.

The amount allotted to solar energy development programmes in the budget grew to Rs 8,644 crore, a 75 per cent increase over the Rs 4,941 crore in the revised FY24 estimates. Notedly, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan Yojana (PM-KUSUM), which aims to solarise the agriculture sector, is not included in this statistic.

Incentivise investment in renewables

According to Aditi Balbir, Co-founder, EcoRatings, the Union Budget 2024 should prioritise investments in sustainable infrastructure projects and clean energy solutions as 70 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions stem from energy, industry, and buildings . This will create a future-proof foundation for economic growth and help in achieving netzero targets. “Globally, 85 per cent of institutional investors incorporate ESG factors into their investment decisions, making ESG investments the emerging norm. The Union Budget should extend industry recognition programs to companies excelling in sustainability. This will encourage wider adoption and foster a more responsible business landscape beyond the financial sector,” she added.

“The introduction of innovative financial instruments, such as green bonds and climate risk insurance, is essential for mobilising private sector investment and driving sustainable projects. Strengthening the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) with clear regulations, enhancing the CCTS offsets demand in India, and robust verification mechanisms will also be vital in incentivising emission reductions and attracting investments in clean technologies. Hand-holding with international QA/QC agencies like ICVCM & VCMI may bring in greater credibility for overseas investment interest in Indian offsets under CCTS,” said Manish Dabkara, Chairman and MD of EKI Energy Services.

Meanwhile, Neerav Nanavaty, CEO at BluPine Energy said that a skilled workforce is crucial to meet escalating demands and push technological boundaries forward. “Seamless integration of renewable sources into a resilient grid infrastructure will enhance national reliability and resilience. Robust regulations for C&I sector will not only attract investments but also streamline operations, fostering sustainable growth. Despite challenges such as high initial costs and regulatory complexities, robust incentives and streamlined processes are imperative to make solar power more accessible and affordable. This strategic focus will propel India towards a brighter, greener future, reinforcing our global leadership in clean energy innovation and sustainability,” Nanavaty said.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-will-green-power-be-a-prioritynbsp-experts-say-incentives-important-3548272/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: NATHEALTH calls for major reforms to improve healthcare infra, increase public health expenditure","NATHEALTH-Healthcare Federation of India on Tuesday announced that it has submitted a blueprint ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25. In its recommendations, NATHEALTH has called on the government to implement transformative measures that focus on strengthening healthcare infrastructure and making strategic investments to address both demand and supply-side challenges, while raising the public health expenditure to above 2.5 percent GDP, the industry body said in a statement.

NATHEALTH in its submission emphasized on increasing PMJAY/CGHS acceptability of the scheme among frontline quality providers in private sector, unlocking private capital to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), easing compliance under ease of doing business using digital tools, and promoting the Medtech & supply value chain eco system to innovation and localization.

“With India becoming a preferred choice globally, policies to promote India as a preferred destination full stack of medical product, services & solution is the need of the hour. NATHEALTH further advocated for rationalizing GST with a uniform 5% rate slab for healthcare and full input tax credit eligibility, addressing the issue of unused MAT credits, and reviewing health cess policies for MedTech to ensure affordability,” it stated on Tuesday.



Additionally, NATHEALTH recommended declaring healthcare a National Priority status to facilitate better financing and offering tax incentives to encourage private sector investment in healthcare infrastructure, manufacturing, digital health, exports and education across India at par with SEZ policies available across other sunshine sectors.

“India has made significant strides toward becoming a global healthcare powerhouse and this has substantially contributed to GDP and job creation. As the nation progresses toward achieving a USD 5 trillion economy, providing quality healthcare for the entire population is a pre-requisite. Addressing healthcare challenges will require an estimated 2 billion square feet of advanced healthcare infrastructure. To meet these needs, increasing GDP spending on healthcare to 2.5% is crucial for enhancing social insurance, expanding facilities in tier 2 and 3 cities, and advancing digital health services,” Abhay Soi, President, NATHEALTH and Chairman & Managing Director, Max Healthcare Institute Limited, said.

The upcoming budget must focus on healthcare infrastructure, innovation, skill development for medical professionals, and strengthening public-private partnerships to ensure improved access and quality across the nation. Prioritizing research and development will drive medical innovation and address emerging health challenges, Soi said in a statement.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-nathealth-calls-for-major-reforms-to-improve-healthcare-infra-increase-public-health-expenditure-3548695/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Highlights: Nirmala Sitharaman to table Budget on July 23,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget for FY25 on July 23. The Budget session will commence on July 22 and conclude on August 12. Earlier, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju made the announcement on X. He posted, “Hon’ble President of India, on the recommendation of Government of India, has approved the proposal for summoning of both the Houses of Parliament for the Budget Session, 2024 from 22nd July, 2024 to 12 August, 2024 (Subject to exigencies of Parliamentary Business).”



In February this year, Nirmala Sitharaman had tabled the interim Budget, which is technically a vote on account ahead of the elections to take care of government expenses in the interim till a new Government is voted to power. This happens every 5 years or when the existing government is dissolved and elections are held.

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: Real estate looks forward to policy reforms to streamline processes, drive growth","After demonstrating robust performance in recent quarters, the Indian real estate sector is looking forward to reforms in the upcoming Union Budget 2024. It is expected that the sector’s contribution to India’s GDP will increase from 8% to 13% by 2025. Furthermore, the long-term outlook suggests that the real estate sector is poised to achieve a market size of $1 trillion by 2030.

Key industry leaders expect that policy reforms will streamline processes, enhance transparency and drive growth.

Neeraj Sharma, MD, Escon Infra Realtors, says, “NITI Aayog’s forecast of the Indian real estate industry reaching a market size of $1 trillion by 2030 underscores its favorable long-term outlook. The industry is looking forward to government initiatives aimed at lowering input costs for steel, cement, and fuel. Meeting the longstanding requests for industry status and a streamlined clearance system would empower developers to obtain loans at reduced interest rates and take advantage of tax benefits. These measures would greatly enhance the industry and promote additional growth.”



The real estate sector is one of the key contributors to the country’s GDP. As developers and industry leaders continue to advocate for policy reforms, the focus remains on reducing construction costs, granting industry status, and implementing a single-window clearance system.



Mukul Bansal, MD, Motiaz, says, “The real estate industry in India is experiencing rapid growth due to increasing housing needs. With the approaching Union Budget 2024-25, there is a strong anticipation for the sector to be granted industry status and for the implementation of a more efficient single-window clearance system. Meeting these long-standing demands would bring new energy to the sector. However, high taxes on essential materials such as cement and steel have led to an increase in housing project costs. The 28% GST on cement is especially worrisome, highlighting the urgent need for its adjustment to match the growing demand.”

Moreover, a key factor highlighting the need to support the real estate sector is its role as a major employer, offering jobs to a large number of casual laborers. Developers contend that incentivizing the sector could have extensive benefits beyond mere economic metrics, significantly improving the livelihoods of many individuals.

Shorabh Upadhyay, MD, Trisol RED, says, “The real estate industry plays a crucial role in driving growth in the Indian economy, and one of its pressing needs is to obtain industry status. This designation would allow developers to access loans at reduced interest rates, as well as take advantage of tax benefits and exemptions. Such support is particularly valuable during periods of economic hardship. Despite a strong recovery in recent years, the sector still requires ongoing assistance from the government to sustain its positive momentum.”

Harsh Gupta, CEO, Sundream Group, says, “Commercial real estate stands as a pivotal driver of the country’s GDP growth, warranting high expectations from the government ahead of the Union Budget 2024-25. Granting industry status to the sector would streamline credit access and reduce financing costs, which is crucial for meeting rising demand in commercial realty. The sector eagerly awaits measures to lower steel and fuel input costs and address the 28% GST on cement. In addition, implementing a single-window clearance system is essential for sustaining momentum and fostering entrepreneurship in commercial realty.”



These measures, coupled with incentives for sustainable practices and streamlined processes, have the potential to boost the sector’s growth significantly.

Ashwani Kumar of Pyramid Infratech says, “Although there is optimism within the industry, obstacles remain. The real estate sector is highly affected by prices, and the high taxes on essential materials like cement and steel continue to increase the project’s construction expenses. We urge the government to address this issue and eagerly anticipate a streamlined approval process. Real estate stands as one of the major job providers in the nation, and any measures that support the sector will positively impact the economy as a whole.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-real-estate-looks-forward-to-policy-reforms-to-streamline-processes-drive-growth-3547445/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: ‘Create new NBFC category serving priority sector, more specifically to MSMEs’","By Shachindra Nath

The increase in MSME contribution to India’s growth, their high optimism for progress despite their challenging external environment, and the accelerated pace of registration by MSMEs on the UDYAM portal to access credit and policy benefits underscore an upswing in MSME activity and performance. Given the changing business dynamics, monitoring the incipient risk of the MSMEs becomes imperative. The low risk and falling delinquency rates are improving the borrowing prospects of the MSME sector. NBFCs have demonstrated a consistently high credit growth trend to the micro and small segments before and after the pandemic.

In this context, we would like to recommend these expectations from the FY24 Union Budget, which aims to address the specific challenges faced by NBFCs, and lay the groundwork for a more inclusive, resilient, and dynamic financial ecosystem for MSMEs. Implementation of these measures will not only benefit the NBFC sector but also contribute significantly to broader economic growth and financial well-being.



Creation of a new category

The proposal suggests the creation of a new category of NBFCs exclusively dedicated to serving the priority sector, more specifically to MSMEs. Similar to the existing classification such as NBFC-HFC and NBFC- MFIs, this envisioned category can be named NBFC-PSL. The criteria for inclusion in this category is to be NBFCs having a minimum of 85 per cent of their AUM focused towards the priority sector.

Banks lending to NBFCs for on-lending to micro & small enterprises irrespective of the ticket size of the loans (as of now, it is capped at max Rs 20 lakh for non-agri loans and Rs 10 lakh for agri loans) are to be treated as PSL. Currently, it is capped at 5 per cent of total PSL by Banks.

Re-Introduction of partial credit guarantee scheme

Re-introduce partial credit guarantee scheme (PCGS) for NBFC-MSME which can be in line with PCGS 1.0 & PCGS 2.0 to provide portfolio guarantee for purchase of bonds or commercial papers with a rating of A or below issued by NBFC-MSME by public sector banks.

Also, reduce risk weight for portfolio originated by NBFC MSME for underlying customers so that such NBFCs can increase the credit penetration.



Harmonization of SARFAESI limit

Reducing the cap for loans eligible under the SARFAESI Act for NBFCs from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 lakh, in line with banks, would enhance the recovery process for smaller loan defaults. This alignment would allow NBFCs to address a larger number of non-performing assets, improving their financial health and boosting confidence among lenders and investors. It would also reduce credit risk, encouraging more lending to the vital MSME sector, thereby supporting economic growth and employment.

What we know so far","Union Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is all set to present the much-awaited union budget, the maiden one of the Modi 3.0 regime, later this month. In the run-up to the Budget presentation in Parliament, as a regular practice ahead of the mega economic event, the finance ministry invites suggestions from various economic and social sectors and also holds consultation meetings with them. This time also the ministry officials led by FM Sitharaman have met many industry associations, union bodies and farming community representatives.

PM Kisan scheme – Here’s what farmers want

One of the key demands that has been put forth by farmer bodies’ representatives is hiking the installment amount under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Rs 8,000 per year from Rs 6,000. As per various media reports, they in a meeting with the FM pressed upon various other issues troubling the farm sector.



Experts are of the view that raising the PM Kisan benefit amount will assist in providing greater financial support to farmers, stabilising their income and tackling rising input costs in the farm sector.

In their meeting Sitharaman, the representatives also sought direct subsidies via direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme to farmers, besides additional funds for research in the agriculture sector.



What is PM-Kisan scheme?

The Centre launched the flagship scheme in December 2018, promising an income support of 6,000 per year in three equal installments to all land holding farmer families. Definition of family for the scheme is husband, wife and minor children.

To implement the scheme, the Centre directed state governments and UT administrations to identify the farmer families which are eligible for support as per scheme guidelines.

Under the PM Kisan Yojana, the central government releases fund directly to the bank accounts of all the beneficiaries.



Eligibility criteria for PM-KISAN scheme:

Land ownership: The beneficiary should be the owner of cultivable land and the landholding should be in his name as per land records.

Cultivable land: Farmers – both small and marginal farmers – who cultivate land, irrespective of the size of landholding, are eligible for the PM Kisan amount.

Family criteria: All eligible farmer families, defined as husband, wife, and minor children, are considered as beneficiaries under the scheme.

Age criteria: The Centre has not kept any age restriction for beneficiaries to avail benefits under the PM-KISAN scheme.

Income criteria: The Centre has not mentioned any income criteria as such for PM Kisan beneficiaries to be eligible. However, institutional landholders and those retired from government service and receiving a pension above a certain threshold are kept out of this scheme.

Citizenship: Only Indian citizens are allowed to take the benefit under this scheme.

Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT): As the PM Kisan amount is sent to beneficiary farmers through DBT, it is important that the farmer’s bank account is linked with a valid Aadhaar number.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/pm-kisan-modi-govt-to-hike-instalment-amount-to-rs-8000-in-budget-what-we-know-so-far-3544480/

In Lok Sabha on August 4, 2023, the Anusandhan National Research Foundation Bill, 2023 was introduced. It not only repealed the Science and Engineering Research Board Act, 2008 but also dissolved the Science and Engineering Research Board set up under it. The Bill provided for establishing the NRF.

Modi government approved the Bill to boost scientific advancement in the country. However, the Union government, in the interim budget for 2024-25, was silent on allocation for the institution or progress made so far.

In 2020, reportedly, it was proposed for the first time under the National Education Policy (NEP). In the country, the NRF aims to centralise scientific research funding.



Reportedly, it would replace the currently established governmental funding agencies such as the Department of Atomic Energy, the Department of Science and Technology, the Department of Biotechnology, the Indian Council of Agriculture Research, the University Grants Commission, and the Indian Council of Medical Research.

In the Union budget for 2021-22, the Modi government announced that it would set aside Rs 50,000 crore for the National Research Foundation over five years.

In 2023-24, the Union budget allocated Rs 2,000 crore for the NRF. However, it was then revised to Rs 258.60 crore.

Functions of the National Research Foundation:

In India, NRF will be the apex body to provide strategic direction for research, innovation, and entrepreneurship in the fields of –

a) Natural sciences including mathematics

b) Engineering and technology

c) Environmental and earth sciences,

d) Health and Agriculture

e) Scientific and technological interfaces of humanities and social sciences

‘India at par with the rest of the world’

On June 21, Union Minister Jitendra Singh in a conversation with Dr. Sethuraman Panchnathan, Director of the U.S. National Science Foundation, said that India will have a robust National Research Foundation (Anusadhan NRF). Once fully functional, it will help in huge transformation in research, and development and also act as a bridge for the integration of public and private sectors including industry and academia.

Also, the Union Minister highlighted the country’s progress in next-generation technologies such as AI/ML, and quantum technologies and said “India on par with the rest of the world in next-generation technologies.”

Dr. Saurabh Lall, Facility Director, and Vice President at Marengo Asia Hospital Gurugram told Financial Express.com that as healthcare professionals and hospital operators in the country, they are delighted that the total healthcare expenditure in the new budget has increased from Rs.79,221 crores in 2023-24 to Rs.90,171 crores in 2024-25.

“As a doctor and a hospital administrator, I think certain areas that need focus and are high expectations of the healthcare sector from the budget are the vaccination protocols and vaccination facilities, especially in the areas of cervical cancer and child immunisation. Mother and child health is a priority for the country, we should have more and more facilities and incentives for mothers to deliver in hospitals and child mortality should be controlled. By virtue of facilities of neonatal ICUs available in the country,” Dr. Lall told Financial Express.com.



A lot of focus is expected from the budget on infrastructure development in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities specifically, he said.

“I believe that we should have government supporting private healthcare players who are existing in the healthcare space to open new facilities be in partnership with the government or standalone facilities and maximise the penetration of healthcare into the healthcare system and in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns,” he said.

Also, there is a huge need for simplifying healthcare processes, especially the insurance processes, the TPA processes, and the adoption of simple logical and legitimate insurance reimbursements in our hospitals, he emphasised.

“One thing that can take healthcare in this country to the next level is digitisation of electronic medical records, e- prescriptions and overall data collection and analysis for research, this will give us a lot of insights into the requirements and the opportunities to go down and solve healthcare problems of the country,” Dr. Lall told Financial Express.com.

Also, the area which should be in priority is medical value travel as we are a country which has the best medical minds in the world and the best-in-class facilities, we should promote medical value travel to the next level by creating situations that are favorable to the international patients to come to the country and explore our medical expertise, he pointed out.

He also emphasised on Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and its importance in ensuring last mile penetration.

“…it will also ensure the exceptionally complex healthcare procedures and surgery that we do in our hospitals is available to every citizen at large and beyond,” he added.

Meanwhile, Sriram Iyer, Chief Executive Officer, Apollo Health and Lifestyle Limited said that they are hopeful the government will continue to prioritise the healthcare sector.

“The February 2024 budget demonstrated a commendable commitment to improving healthcare infrastructure and services, and we anticipate that this focus will be sustained and enhanced in the upcoming budget. We look forward to a potential increase in funding that could further support critical programs and services in mother and child care. Enhancements in prenatal and postnatal care, neonatal intensive care units, and pediatric emergency services are crucial for addressing the growing needs of our community,” Iyer told Financial Express.com.

We trust that the upcoming budget will continue to support the development of a robust and resilient healthcare system, ensuring the highest standard of care for all, he said.

Gautam Khanna, CEO, P.D. Hinduja Hospital & Medical Research Centre, Mumbai highlighted that the upcoming budget should reflect these needs and focus on further strengthening India’s healthcare resources, infrastructure and technological prowess.

“To achieve this and enhance the quality and access of healthcare services in India, we request the Finance Minister to allocate healthcare budget to the tune of 2.5-3.5% of GDP. India’s elderly population is expected to reach a staggering 347 million by 2050. This demographic shift is a societal transformation of unparalleled magnitude with far-reaching implications particularly an increased pressure on the existing healthcare systems,” Khanna told Financial Express.com.

The government’s consideration of comprehensive policy measures for senior care, encompassing health, financial, social, and digital support, is commendable and timely, he said.

“We strongly support the proposal to provide health benefits to all individuals over 60 years of age, with a contributory scheme of coverage up to Rs 5 lakh annually. The potential expansion of the Ayushman Bharat PM Jan Arogya Yojana to cover all senior citizens, including non-medical and in-home care needs, represents a holistic approach to elderly care that we hope to see implemented. We would also like the government to bring in a PMJAY equivalent scheme for the middle class too,” Khanna said.

He also pointed out that the private sector is expanding rapidly, to bridge the accessibility gap. “This should be encouraged with depreciation allowances for investments in diagnostic infrastructure, incentives for infrastructure development, and improving ease of doing business for the private sector in all cities. Introducing either Zero rating GST to the healthcare sector with Input Tax credit or bringing the healthcare sector under 5% GST with Input Tax credit, will help. The private sector should be viewed as a partner by the government to bring healthcare benefits to the masses,” he said.

Khanna also said that the previous budget’s substantial commitment to Research and Development with a Rs 1 lakh crore corpus and a 50-year interest-free loan for sunrise sectors, can be instrumental in encouraging private players to scale up healthcare research and innovation, especially in the start-up domain, he said.

“Digital healthcare with Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning is already playing an important part to bridge the accessibility and affordability gap. Such innovative healthcare delivery models, with potential to scale, can be encouraged with tax incentives on technology, developing an ecosystem to support such initiatives and public-private partnerships. This budget presents an opportunity to build on the progress made and further solidify India’s position as a leader in healthcare delivery, innovation, accessibility, and medical technology,” he added.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Will technology be leveraged to improve tax administration and compliance?,"Question: Given the ongoing digital transformation, are there any predictions for how technology might be leveraged to improve tax administration and compliance?

Response given by CA (Dr.) Suresh Surana: Data analytics as well as artificial intelligence have been adopted by tax authorities to simplify and streamline the tax administration, reduce errors, tackle tax fraud, identify credit fraud, etc. Additionally, the adoption of technology may enable successful and sustainable tax reforms, ensure the proper taxation of digital economy, and reduce the obstacles to compliance.





In preceding years, the involvement of technology in tax administration has progressed since the government has introduced the following:

a. Annual Information Statement: In addition to the high-value transactions and TDS/TCS details mentioned in Form 26AS, the Annual Information Statement (AIS) includes more transaction details therefore widening the ambit of income disclosure.

b. The CBDT’s e-Verification Scheme, 2021, an initiative encouraging voluntary tax compliance, allows the department to identify discrepancies between the information taxpayers report in their Income Tax Returns (ITRs) and information received from third-party sources like banks on interest and dividend income.

c. The Faceless Assessment Scheme introduced by the government eliminates the interface between the Assessing Officer and the taxpayer during the course of proceedings, to the extent that is technologically feasible and therefore promotes optimum utilisation of resources through economies of scale and functional specialization.

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: Focus on rapid infrastructure growth to continue, roadways likely to see increased capex","In the upcoming Union Budget 2024-25, the government is expected to maintain its focus on infrastructure development. According to a report in Mint, there are potential plans to increase capital expenditure allocations for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) for FY25.

The increase in allocations is likely to be moderate. This jump could be between 5 per cent to 10 per cent over the revised estimates of FY24, the report said. Road construction projects is expected to see a significant increase in private sector investments, particularly under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) toll model.

Private investments in FY24 reached Rs 34,805 crore and are projected to nearly double in FY25, up from Rs 20,000 crore in FY23.



Did roadways get enough allocation in Interim Budget?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Interim Budget 2024-25 on February 1 which included a modest increase in budget allocation for the road sector compared to the previous year.

In the Interim Budget, the government allocated Rs 2,78,000 crore for the MoRTH, a rise of 2.7% as compared to the Rs 2,70,434 crore allocated in 2023-24. However, the revised allocation for the ministry for the fiscal year 2023-24 was Rs 2,76,351.45 crore, making the new allocation only 0.5% higher.

A higher allocation will help boost highway construction and address the substantial Rs 3.5 trillion debt accrued by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) by the end of FY24. The government aims to construct 12,000 to 13,000 km of national highways and award contracts for a similar distance to maintain progress in highway development over the coming years.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/business/roadways-budget-2024-focus-on-rapid-infrastructure-growth-to-continue-roadways-likely-to-see-increased-capex-3541531/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: Healthcare industry leaders demand increase in allocation, emphasise on strengthening infra","Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will announce the Union Budget 2024 next month. Ahead of the Union Budget 2024, industry leaders in the healthcare sector are expecting substantial increase in the overall health budget.

Bhanu Prakash Kalmath S J, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat told Financial Express.com that wile the Interim Budget 2024 offered a glimpse of the government’s healthcare priorities with initiatives like coverage of ASHA workers and Anganwadi workers and helpers in Ayushman Bharat Scheme, the U-WIN immunization platform and the cervical cancer vaccination drive, the upcoming full budget presents an opportunity for further progress toward the goal of ‘Viksit Bharat’.

“We hope for a substantial increase in the overall health budget to reach at least 3 percent of GDP to address existing gaps comprehensively. Strengthening rural healthcare infrastructure and expanding the reach and coverage of Ayushman Bharat, would be a significant step towards further bringing down the out-of-pocket medical expenditure and ensuring Universal Health Coverage,” Kalmath said.



He also said that building rural healthcare and social infrastructure remains a critical priority, as it will improve access to quality care, encourage healthy living, and also create employment opportunities.

According to Kalmath, preventive healthcare is a cornerstone of a healthy nation; therefore, increased funding for sanitation and nutrition programs, along with a continued focus on non-communicable diseases through targeted interventions and awareness campaigns, can significantly reduce the burden of curative care.

“By embracing technology for early detection and improved access to specialists, we can unlock the full potential of our healthcare system. We expect that the upcoming budget will prioritize these crucial areas, paving the way for a healthier India,” he told Financial Express.com.

Meanwhile, Girish Korde, Founder & Director, Sunrise Oncology Centre also said that he is expecting an increased allocation of budget towards healthcare.

“Topmost priority should be allocated towards the improvement of healthcare infrastructure to ensure access to remote locations as well. These areas either need the upgradation of existing infrastructure or the provision of new medical infrastructure. Logically – the next priority has to be the availability of skilled manpower to deliver healthcare,” Korde told Financial Express.com.

Technology plays a key role, especially when a manpower shortage is seen. Hence, the inclusion of technology should be the focus for remote monitoring, healthcare delivery, access to experts, digital health records, etc.

“Lastly, we actually need to focus on “health” care instead of “disease”care. Hence, increased focus on preventive care is important – especially for a young population in a country like India. Last but not the least, schemes like Ayushman Bharat should see increased penetration and overall an increased population getting access to insurance,” he added.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-healthcare-industry-leaders-hope-substantial-increase-in-allocation-emphasise-on-strengthening-infra-3540626/

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: What does the Media & Entertainment industry expect from Union Budget?,"– By Himanshu Parekh and Krishnan Venkatasubramanian

The Indian media and entertainment (M&E) industry is growing significantly, thanks to the increasing popularity of OTT platforms, impetus to digital infrastructure by the government and the craze for cinema amongst people.

On the tax front, while the government has undertaken several tax reforms over the years, there are still certain pain points of the M&E industry, which need to be addressed in the upcoming Union Budget.





Some of the key pain points are as under:

The M&E industry is grappling with a few issues on the TDS front. As per the tax law, the taxpayers are allowed to claim credit of TDS only if the corresponding income is offered to tax in the tax return for that year. For a variety of reasons, there can be timing differences between the year in which tax is deducted by the deductor and the corresponding income is offered to tax by the deduce. Given the large volume of transactions, it puts an onerous burden on the taxpayers to reconcile the TDS with the corresponding income and the year in which it is offered to tax. The Income-tax Act may be suitably amended to provide that the TDS credit reflected in Form 26AS for a particular year be allowed to the taxpayers during that relevant year under consideration.

Another pain point on the TDS front pertains to advertising agencies. The advertising agency while raising invoice on its clients charges a lump sum amount which comprises the Advertisement fees (payable to the media) and their fees. The advertisers then deduct tax on the gross billing amount (of which only a small portion constitutes income of the advertising agency). In other words, the advertising agencies suffer TDS on the advertisement charges as well, which income belongs to the media. On account of this, the actual tax liability of such agencies is significantly less than the TDS suffered by them, which then leads to a huge blockage of funds. Hence, there exists a pressing need of the advertising agencies for the government to reduce the TDS rate on amounts paid by advertisers to them for placement of advertisements, so as to ease their cash flow issue.

Moving on, several M&E industry players have been availing services from foreign satellites for transmission of their TV channels and to data centers for hosting and downloading of their content. In this regard, the tax authorities have been holding that payment towards the above services is in the nature of royalty / fees for technical services and thus is subject to withholding tax. However, given that these are standard services with no human intervention involved, it should be clarified by the government that such payments are not in the nature of royalty / fees for technical service and thus are not subject to withholding tax in India.

In case of amalgamation of companies, losses of the amalgamating company are allowed to be transferred to the amalgamated company only for a certain class of companies, which does not include companies in the M&E sector. One of the long-standing demands of the M&E sector is that the provisions should be amended to allow the benefit of carry forward of losses to the companies in the M&E sector as well.

On the GST front, the Budget is not expected to make new announcements, as the same is addressed by the GST Council meetings. However, the upcoming Budget could look at introducing amendments in the GST law pertaining to the proposals announced in the recently concluded 53rd GST Council meeting. These amendments aimed to address industry concerns, can include, amongst others, provisions towards amnesty scheme for waiver of interest and penalties, reducing pre-deposit for filing appeals, allowing claim of Input Tax Credit upto November 2021 for prior years. With these amendments, the industry can look forward to reducing ongoing litigations.

A key expectation from the Government, which was not covered in the recent Council meeting, is the taxability for online games. The industry is advocating 28% GST on Gross Gaming Revenue, as opposed to the current system of 28% on the total amount deposited by the players.

In all, the government has already set its intentions clear to steer India towards being ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. Certain favourable policy and tax announcements for the M&E sector will certainly help fuel growth of the M&E sector and take India closer to its goal of becoming ‘Viksit Bharat’.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Will the prices of medicines go down after Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement?,"Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be announcing the Union Budget 2024 soon. Sources told Financial Express.com that the Finance Minister will most likely table the Union Budget 2024 on July 23 or July 24.

Ahead of the Union Budget 2024, healthcare industry leaders are expecting a lot of policy reforms, price relaxation and major scheme announcements. Some experts are expecting a comprehensive approach to healthcare spending in the interim budget of 2024.

As the increasing prices of medicines continue to burden the public, will the Finance Minister cut down the cost of medicines in the Union Budget 2024 presentation?



“We anticipate that the Center will focus on addressing the rising prices of medicines while strengthening India’s medical equipment manufacturing units. Optimism is high this year, as increased budget allocations for pharmaceutical research and development are possible. This could foster innovation and pave the way for more affordable medicines in the future. We are also hopeful of a significant boost in the pharma sector’s budget, which is crucial for ensuring access to affordable life-saving drugs for diseases like cancer and HIV. Additionally, it will support affordable lifestyle medicines as part of preventive care,” Probal Ghosal, Chairman & Director Ujala Cygnus group of Hospitals told Financial Express.com.

The government appears committed to affordable healthcare, Ghosal said.

In April this year, Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya announced that there would be no increase in the prices of essential medicines for this fiscal year due to negligible growth in wholesale price-based inflation.

“This move underscores the government’s dedication to making healthcare accessible to all. So, while there are some challenges, the government’s proactive steps and potential budget enhancements for the pharmaceutical sector inspire hope for more affordable medicines, ensuring that healthcare remains within reach for all citizens,” Ghosal told Financial Express.com.

Meanwhile, Dr Girdhar Gyani, Founder Director, Association of Healthcare Providers ( AHPI) told Financial Express.com that a robust healthcare system is essential for our population’s well-being and the country’s overall growth.

“As provided in the health policy of year 2017, we expect government to focus on realizing universal health coverage. There will be initiative to improve healthcare infrastructure in general and in tier-III towns and rural areas in particular. The supply of medicines shall be further enhanced through JAN AUSHADI centres. Despite a recent minimal rise in prices of essential medicines like painkillers, antibiotics, and anti-infectives, the impact on the general population remains limited. The industry has faced rising input costs and sought substantial price increases, but the latest minimal hike offers some respite after two major increases. We hope the new government will focus on making medicines for life-threatening diseases like cancer and HIV more affordable,” Dr. Gyani told Financial Express.com.

We also expect the government to launch a focus on promotive and preventive healthcare including emphasis on; safe drinking water, improved sanitation and nutrition, he said.

“The government is expected to make all sub-centres as Health & Wellness centres, capable of screening for NCDs as well to promote holistic wellness. Addressing drug costs demands a multifaceted approach, including regulatory reforms to streamline the approval process and enhance transparency. Robust research support is crucial for developing new, cost-effective treatments,” he said.

Promoting fair competition through TAX reforms within the pharmaceutical industry is also vital to preventing monopolies and keeping prices in check, he added.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Will Nirmala Sitharaman reduce your hospital admission bills?,"Union Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to table the Union Budget 2024 in the third week of July during the monsoon session. Although the government has not announced the dates, sources told Financial Express.com that it is expected to be announced on 23 July or 24 July.

During the Interim Budget 2024, the Finance Minister made some crucial announcements for the healthcare sector like prioritisation of cervical cancer and upgradation of Anganwadi centres. But a lot of long-standing expectations like an extension of the concessional tax regime, GST rationalisation and increased investments in the healthcare sector remained unmet. However, industry leaders are hopeful that these issues will be addressed in the upcoming budget.

The cost of hospital admission continues to be worrisome. In May this year, the Supreme Court had pulled up the government for its failure to specify a range of prices that private hospitals and clinical establishments can charge for various treatments and procedures. Following this, the Bureau of Indian Standards has initiated efforts to standardise and enhance transparency in the billing process at hospitals.



BIS, which is a part of the National Standards Body of India, had also called for consultations from industry bodies and other stakeholders, as per a report by Mint. If you don’t have insurance, hospital expenditure can burn a hole in your pocket. In most cases, hospitals have different costs for patients who pay themselves and for those whose insurance companies pay. Most people have to pay around half of healthcare spending – especially medicines – out of their pocket.

According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 55 million people are pushed back into poverty every year because of “catastrophic” health expenses, which affect some 17 percent of households.

Dr Girdhar Gyani,Founder Director, Association of Healthcare Providers (AHPI) told Financial Express.com that the cost of hospital admission saw a rise post-COVID-19, but we are now witnessing stability in these expenses.

‘Increase in hospital admission costs not expected’

“As we look ahead to the new fiscal year, we are not anticipating any significant increase in hospital admission costs, thanks to the proactive approach by the government for affordable and inclusive healthcare. To minimise out-of-pocket expenses and financial risks, we strongly recommend population in securing reliable health insurance. Health insurance provides a safety net, ensuring that individuals are not burdened by unexpected medical expenses,” Dr. Gyani told Financial Express.com.

Meanwhile, the Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY scheme has been instrumental in benefiting the sizeable population, in meeting hospital admission costs, Dr. Gyani claimed.

“Ensuring affordable and accessible healthcare remains our priority at AHPI, and we continue to advocate for policies that support this goal,” he said.

Prateek Ghosal, Chief of Strategy, Growth & Digital Ujala Cygnus Healthcare Services also said that any significant increases in healthcare costs for patients is not expected.

“For out-of-pocket patients, medical inflation will be the only main driver. However, with an increased push towards standardization of healthcare costs with the impending discussions between the Ministry of Health and State Governments, patients may seem some rationalisation. On a broader front, I expect the Government of India’s flagship scheme – PMJAY, coverage to increase to include senior citizens from the existing base of 10 million households which will widely benefit the country,” Ghosal told Financial Express.com.

However, private participation towards PMJAY continues to be low, only 25 percent of private hospitals are empanelled with PMJAY and this percent reduces in Metro cities, he revealed.

“An increase in reimbursement rates and smoother payment cycles will ensure greater acceptability within the private sector and therefore more options for patients,” he added.

Need for various policy considerations

In February this year, the apex court had criticised the government for failing to enforce the 14-year-old Clinical Establishment (Central Government) Rules, which are aimed at enforcing standard charges for various medical treatments and procedures.

“Better quality care and increase in infrastructure and input costs of hospitals are likely to push the cost of hospital admission. This burden is further compounded by the rising cost of medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and even administrative expenses. However, adoption of advanced technologies can optimize the healthcare cost,” Bhanu Prakash Kalmath S J, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat told Financial Express.com.

Prakash also maintained that focusing on preventive care can bring down the overall healthcare cost of the country.

“Further, policy considerations, such as bringing healthcare under priority lending, categorization of healthcare services under zero rated the Goods and Services Tax (GST) than current exempted category can bring down the healthcare cost. Further coverage of wider population including the ‘missing middle’ under medical insurance scheme with a reasonable premium can bring down the cost of healthcare in the hands of the end user,” he told Financial Express.com.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-will-nirmala-sitharaman-reduce-your-hospital-admission-bills-3536689/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: Real estate looks for policy boost, tax sops for homebuyers","The Indian real estate industry has achieved remarkable growth figures in recent quarters. As the Union Budget 2024 approaches, there is optimism within the sector for significant reforms to be announced. Through the allocation of resources and the implementation of favorable policies, the government has the power to accelerate the growth of this industry, leading to job creation and economic stimulation.

Developers are eagerly anticipating the budget announcements and have expressed their essential requirements, which, if met, will contribute to shaping the trajectory of the sector in the upcoming fiscal year.

“As the real estate sector eagerly anticipates the 2024 Union Budget, we hope to see policy measures that foster sustainable growth and address key challenges facing the industry. This sector plays a pivotal role in the economy, contributing significantly to employment and GDP. We urge the authorities to not forget initiatives to facilitate employment, facilitate regulatory approvals and encourage funding in low-priced housing. Supportive regulations will no longer simply encourage investor confidence but additionally facilitate important infrastructure,” says Shiwang Suraj, Founder & Director, InfraMantra.



Furthermore, measures are needed to boost cash flow within the quarter, together with mitigation of cost burdens and enhancement of tax sops for homebuyers. These steps can stimulate calls throughout broader segments of society to ensure housing availability.



Moreover, as the demand and supply for affordable homes have shown fluctuating trends over the last three years across major Tier I and Tier II cities, the upcoming budget should focus on revitalising both the demand and supply for homes in the Rs 15-75 lakh per unit price bracket. Introducing interest subsidy programs could incentivise potential homebuyers effectively.

Dhruv Agarwala, Group CEO, Housing.com & PropTiger.com, says, “To boost supply, the government could strategically deploy its extensive land banks in partnership with private developers, offering land and capital at concessional rates. Implementing tax incentives for developers engaging in these affordable projects could further stimulate activity in this sector. It’s noteworthy that substantial demand persists within the Rs 15-75 lakh price category, necessitating focused governmental action in the upcoming budget. This approach would not only catalyze growth in the real estate sector but also stimulate approximately 200 ancillary industries, substantially boosting job creation across these sectors.”

There is also the need to motivate state governments to reduce stamp duty on affordable housing to make these homes more accessible. Moreover, long-standing sector demands, such as granting industry or infrastructure status and raising tax exemption limits on home loan repayments, should be considered to sustain long-term growth in the housing sector.

Avneesh Sood, Director of Eros Group, says, “While industry status for real estate and revived incentives for affordable housing remain key expectations, a nuanced approach is crucial. Beyond fiscal incentives, the budget should focus on enhancing transparency and efficiency through a robust regulatory framework and streamlined approvals process. Introducing innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds tailored for sustainable urban development, could align economic growth with environmental stewardship. Moreover, there’s a pressing need to revisit GST input tax credit rules to mitigate cost burdens and bolster market transparency. Emphasizing digital infrastructure and smart city initiatives will not only modernize urban living but also attract foreign investment.”

By prioritizing these measures, the government can catalyze a resilient recovery in the real estate sector, fortifying its role as a cornerstone of economic growth and employment generation in the post-pandemic era.

Aman Gupta, Director of RPS Group, says, “The real estate sector expects further reforms in the budget to solve the existing issues. We expect a single-window clearance to be finalized and implemented to avoid more delays and increased cost for projects. The industry also awaits policies that promote rental housing, including tax incentives for owners and the framework for the Model Tenancy Act for the states.”

Another emerging area is to raise the permissible statutory regulations in relation to home loan interest deductions, which holds potential to bring homeownership within the reach of a middle-income earner.

“We are also expecting policies that will help with the implementation of new technologies for the construction industry. For instance, through offering grants for research and development or subsidies for integrating PropTech into the construction industry. Finally, the sector wants policies and measures to lure foreign investment through change in FDI policy or via tax exemption for large scale development of urban infrastructure projects. More such support would undoubtedly help further develop the sector and bring about a more rapid turnaround in its development for modernization,” adds Gupta.

Gunjan Goel, Director at Goel Ganga Developments, says, “Actions are expected to raise funds for affordable housing, including the expansion of tax incentives for first-time homebuyers and the extension of PMAY timelines. The industry also expects the government to bring down GST rates on under-construction properties to boost the demand. There is another expectation of an increasingly globalized market, namely, the rationalization of capital gains tax on property sales for secondary market trades. This is because it can encourage the implementation of sustainable and green buildings where perhaps policies such as tax credits or rebates for green building practices could be adopted. Finally, there is probability for expansion by way of improvement policies towards constrained liquidity for different sectors, including housing finance companies through a priority sector lending. These measures would do more than help revive the real estate market.”

The real estate sector is expecting policies that would help strengthen its position. “Our expectations on future policies include those that encourage integrated township developments, which may include allowing relaxed zoning ordinances and tax incentives. The industry also anticipates actions in relation to the discovered negative impacts that consists of encouraging strategies for structure construction particularly in areas affected by floods due to climate change. Another pressing expectation is the growth of REITs and InvITs possibly through more liberal regulatory measures and favorable tax treatment so that the end-use investors could be attracted easily. We are also awaiting some positive steps which should act as a catalyst for growth in the senior living segment, which may entail some kind of differential incentive structure for developers in this segment which is a growing segment indeed,” says LC Mittal, Director, Motia Group.



The sector is also looking for policies which will enhance skill development in modem constructions, through subsidized training sessions or derive tax incentives for companies seeking to train its workforce.

Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Pvt Ltd, says, “The 2024-25 budget may prove to be a golden chance to meet the new challenges of the real estate sector. Looking closer, measures to stimulate the commercial real estate segment which has clearly been weakened by shifting work patterns are anticipated. This could involve offering tax credits to businesses intending to occupy offices or to developers offering versatile commercial spaces. The industry also wishes to see policies to kick-start redevelopment; possibly, there may be some specific incentives for overhauling older portions of cities. Another important expectation is that governments should work towards the proper and consistent taxation of stamp duty for the upliftment of property demand. We are also anticipating measures that would create added vitality in the logistics and warehousing segment like the infrastructure for large scale approval.”

Last but not least, the sector expects initiatives to boost the digital transformation of real estate transactions, potentially by encouraging the use of blockchain technology in property registration. Policies such as these would put the real estate sector into long-standing development trajectories and long-term sustainable growth paths.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/budget-2024-real-estate-looks-for-policy-boost-tax-sops-for-homebuyers-3537076/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: RSS-affiliate trade union demands extension of MGNREGA to 200 days, restoration of OPS","The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-affiliate central trade union, has demanded an extension of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme for 200 days for each family from 100 days now, and suggested inclusion of agriculture and allied sector work in the centrally-funded welfare scheme.

It also demanded the restoration of the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and enhancing the minimum monthly pension under the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS), 1995 to Rs 5,000.

The demands were raised during the pre-Budget consultation chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at the Ministry of Finance on Tuesday.



B. Surendran, BMS All India Organising Secretary suggested that the Union Budget 2024-25 must focus on – rural development, MSMEs, Manufacturing, Exports and Infrastructure Development.

The trade union also demanded the enhancement of the honorarium of scheme workers, especially for ASHA, Aanganwadi, Midday Meal and National Health Mission (NHM) workers.

“The government must ensure provision of adequate funding for Beedi and other unorganised sector welfare boards and a minimum monthly pension of Rs 5000 and variable dearness allowance along with benefits of Ayushman Bharat for all EPS 95 pensioners,” it said in a statement issued on Tuesday.

It also urged the Union government to take steps to fill all vacancies in Centre, “which currently stand close to 20 lakh”, and also create permanent posts for sanitary and sewerage workers in municipalities and panchayats as well as regularise all contract workers in the arena working for over two decades.

The union also demanded that the eighth pay commission be constituted with efficient people appointed at the helm.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: What kind of tax relief can home owners expect and what’s in store for real estate in this Budget; Read here for all details,"With a contribution of over 7-8 per cent to the GDP of the country, India’s real estate sector, also being a critical driver for employment and economic growth, is poised for further momentum in the upcoming Budget. Given the importance of the sector, it is no wonder that the real estate industry is keenly looking forward to the Union Budget for FY25 which is likely to be tabled in the Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23 or 24.

With increasing demands for housing, office spaces, and commercial zones, the industry is looking forward to crucial policy changes under the Modi 3.0 administration. The real estate players are anticipating policy reforms that can further improve investment in the segment from foreign as well as domestic sources, revision in affordability housing caps, changes in taxation rules for property purchases, deduction in home loan interest rates, industry status for real estate, among other incentives.

Shrutikirti Kumar, Partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, said, “As we look ahead to the budget from the new Government, the stakeholders in the real estate sector anticipate additional measures to boost affordability and demand. Key expectations include: (a) increase in the deduction limit on home loan interest, to incetivise home buyers; (b) a change in the definition of ‘affordable housing’ under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana by increasing the price cap from Rs 45 lakh to reflect market variations across cities; and (c) allocating another tranche in the corpus of the Special Window for Completion of Affordable and Mid-Income Housing Projects (SWAMIH) fund, which will help in mobilising the real estate market. The long-standing demand for ‘infrastructure’ status for the entire real estate sector is also an expectation that the stakeholders continue to have.”



According to a report by ANAROCK Group, the Indian housing sector remained upbeat in 2024 to date, with housing sales and new launches creating new peaks in the top 7 cities. Sales reached an all-time high at about 4.93 lakh units in FY23-24, while 4.47 lakh units were launched. Anuj Puri, Chairman, ANAROCK Group, said, “While expectations are high for tax reliefs and other boosters, the government is also focussed on building strong infrastructure across the length and breadth of the country. Besides the usual wish list of real estate including industry status for the sector, the ‘real’ need of the hour is the revival of the affordable housing segment.” As per ANAROCK Research, affordable housing sales share has declined significantly since the pandemic, to approximately 20 per cent in Q1 2024 from over 26 per cent in 2022, and over 38 per cent in 2019. Not surprisingly, this segment’s percentage of the total housing supply in the top 7 cities also fell to 18 per cent in Q1 2024 from nearly 40% in 2019. Given the impact of the pandemic on the affordable housing segment, Anuj Puri said, “It is imperative to revive and extend significant benefits, such as tax breaks, to encourage developers to construct more affordable housing and for buyers to make it possible for them to acquire such homes.”

Here are expectations of the real estate industry from Union Budget 2024:

Anmoll D Shroff, Founder & CEO, Graanth Realty

The upcoming Union Budget 2024 can enable the country to rise to this task by boosting the real estate sector with tax incentives, improved tax structures and a single window clearance policy. These will encourage further investment in the real estate sector from both foreign and domestic sources. Additionally, tax reforms such as lower income tax for corporate and individual taxpayers, simpler tax laws, targeted incentives, and reduced GST rates on construction materials, will stimulate construction activity and create a more conducive environment for real estate players. The overall impact of the aforementioned reforms will increase the funds available to taxpayers, empowering them to become more avid consumers of real estate and, eventually, contribute to more rapid economic growth for the country as a whole.

Bhavesh Shah, Joint Managing Director, Today Global Developers

We are committed to the government’s vision of ‘housing for all’ and anticipate transformative changes in the upcoming Budget 2024-25. The real estate sector plays a pivotal role in the economy, significantly contributing to employment. From this aspect the budget is important for the sector and we hope to see critical challenges being addressed to stimulate demand and promote sustainable growth in housing. Key expectations include increased tax slabs, revised affordability caps, and various incentives. We are aligned with the sector’s expectations of an expanded SWAMIH stress fund, the reintroduction of GST with an input tax credit, granting industry status, and offering perks for first-time homebuyers. Raising the cap on affordable housing from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 65 lakh will make incentives more accessible, as diverse locations demand different price caps rather than uniformity.

Suraj Morajkar, MD, Sun Estates Developers

In 2024, the demand for residential properties is anticipated to persist, albeit at a moderated pace. This trend is fueled by the nation’s robust economic expansion and the looming prospect of reduced home loan interest rates. Given the expiration of several interest stimulants for developers and consumers, there is a pressing need to reintroduce and prolong vital incentives. These could include tax concessions aimed at incentivizing developers to focus on constructing more affordable housing units and enabling consumers to access such properties. Moreover, the government must critically assess and potentially revise the qualifying cost criteria for properties categorized as affordable housing within urban areas. This adjustment can significantly enhance accessibility and affordability for prospective homebuyers.

Dharmendra Raichura, VP Finance, Ashar Group

As the Indian real estate industry anticipates Budget 2024, it seeks measures to enhance housing accessibility and affordability. One such proposed initiative could be to increase tax exemption limits on both the principal and interest paid on home loans. Additionally, providing tax incentives for developers focusing on affordable housing could stimulate supply to meet the growing demand in both urban and rural areas. Reintroducing a 100% tax holiday for affordable housing projects under Section 80IBA is also recommended.

Moreover, with the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) now implemented across most states, granting “Industry” status to the real estate sector could facilitate easier and more cost-effective financing for developers. To address the land shortage in metropolitan and semi-metropolitan areas and to make housing more affordable, the government should consider releasing government-owned lands at reduced costs. This includes lands owned by entities such as Indian Railways and Port Trusts. This strategic initiative is expected to significantly contribute to lowering overall real estate prices.

Jash Panchamia, Management, Suraksha Group

The real estate sector has several key expectations for the Union Budget 2024. These include increasing tax slabs and revising affordability housing caps to make housing more accessible. Stakeholders are advocating for increasing the affordability limit of housing from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 75 lakh in metro cities, particularly in the MMR and NCR regions. Additionally, the reintroduction of the Credit-Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) and better home loan rates can help affordable housing absorption faster. Tax incentives for first-time homebuyers and the push for industry status are also on the agenda. These measures aim to stimulate demand and ensure sustainable growth for the sector.

Pradeep Aggarwal, Founder & Chairman, Signature Global (India) Ltd; & Chairman, ASSOCHAM National Council on Real Estate, Housing and Urban Development

As we look forward to the upcoming budget, the real estate sector anticipates several key reforms to drive growth and efficiency. Granting Industry status to real estate will attract investments and streamline regulations. A simplified single-window clearance system will expedite project approvals, reduce delays, and enhance overall project execution. Revising the GST input tax credit rules will reduce property prices and increase transparency, while increasing the home loan interest rebate under Section 24 to Rs 5 lakh will boost demand. Additionally, increased budget allocations for urban infrastructure and lower stamp duty rates for property transactions or waiver for first time homebuyers from stamp duty will stimulate real estate growth. Expanding the definition of affordable housing to include homes up to Rs 75 lakh with a larger carpet area of 90 sq. meters, along with the relaunch of the CLSS scheme or similar scheme will further benefit homebuyers.

Vimal Nadar, Senior Director & Head of Research, Colliers India

The real estate community looks at the first budget of the recently elected government with optimism, seeking a strategic roadmap that aligns with the overall vision of real estate reaching a USD 1 trillion market size by 2030. The industry is hopeful of housing, infrastructure development, sustainability and digitization to remain at the core of budgetary announcements. Real estate growth across segments will be instrumental in balancing out traction in tier I and other smaller cities. Focus on EV infrastructure, renewable energy and green financing can pave the way for a sustainable future and eventual realization of net-zero targets. Incentivization of green buildings through minimum alternate tax or tax breaks similar to the infrastructure sector will be particularly beneficial. The upcoming budget should explore initiatives to boost greater retail engagement in REITs and InvITs. Moreover, modifications to personal tax slabs, tax incentives have the potential to fuel consumption across various sectors, including real estate assets and allied sectors.

Sunil Sisodiya, Founder, Geetanjali Homestate

The expectations from the upcoming Union Budget under the new government center around the possibility of increased deductions for home loans, particularly aiming to provide a substantial boost to affordable housing initiatives. The sector looks forward to supportive policies that not only facilitate homebuyers but also stimulate growth in the real estate market. The budget presents a crucial opportunity to implement measures that can catalyze the sector’s revival and contribute significantly to India’s economic resurgence. It is imperative to revive and extend significant benefits, such as tax breaks, to encourage developers to construct more affordable housing and to make it possible for customers to acquire such homes.

Vishal Raheja, Founder & MD, InvestoXpert

As the Union Budget approaches, the real estate industry holds high expectations for initiatives aimed at enhancing urban infrastructure and improving connectivity. Such initiatives can spur demand for residential and commercial properties, building on the unprecedented growth seen in 2023 despite challenges like surging prices and the highest interest rates in six years. The success of the housing market, with record-breaking residential property sales in volume and value, is anticipated to continue into 2024. However, the pace may slow, driven by high economic growth and a hopeful decrease in home loan interest rates.

Annually, the real estate sector presents an ambitious wish list to the Finance Ministry, including industry status for housing and single-window clearance for projects. Key requests this year remain unchanged, highlighting their ongoing urgency. Notably, increasing the Section 24 tax rebate from Rs 2 lakh to at least Rs 5 lakh could invigorate the budget homes market. Reviving and extending expired benefits for developers and consumers is imperative to encourage affordable housing construction and acquisition. The government must also consider adjusting qualifying costs within cities’ affordable housing segments to meet current market realities.

Sandeep Runwal, Managing Director, Runwal

The Government’s commitment to creating world-class infrastructure for sustainable living will attract foreign direct investment, reflecting increased confidence among NRIs to invest in luxury real estate. To further boost investment, we suggest reducing long-term capital gains taxes on property and streamlining REITs coupled with increasing the limit of interest rebate for housing loans. Additionally, the implementation of modern regulatory frameworks and the Urban Governance Curriculum will positively impact the real estate sector. The substantial growth of the real estate sector requires increased manpower, hence, the other suggestion includes further investments in upskilling to ensure seamless and on time delivery while maintaining quality standards of the projects. We are hopeful that the budget not only will address existing challenges but also foster sector growth.

Aditya Kushwaha, CEO and Director, Axis Ecorp

The real estate sector has flourished in recent years despite challenges such as rising property prices and the highest interest rates in six years. Demand for luxury real estate and second home categories has remained robust. We anticipate that the 2024 Budget will favour homebuyers, supporting the sector’s ongoing growth. The recent focus on affordable housing is expected to continue, especially with FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s interim budget announcement of adding 2 crore more houses to the PMAY-U scheme. A similar emphasis on affordable housing in the upcoming budget would be beneficial.

Tax rationalization for construction raw materials and reduced approval costs are crucial to creating a more conducive environment for investment and development. Transparency has significantly boosted the real estate sector and further prioritised it by strengthening RERA and enhancing digital platforms for property transactions can foster trust and reduce fraudulent activities. Streamlining project approvals through a single-window clearance system is essential to address approval delays, which are significant bottlenecks. Additionally, continued focus on infrastructure projects will benefit the real estate sector and boost the travel and tourism industry.

Amrita Gupta, Director, Manglam Group; and Founder President, CREDAI Rajasthan Women’s Wing

As we look forward to the upcoming budget, our focus at Manglam Group remains firmly on enhancing housing affordability in popular cities like Jaipur, Udaipur, Goa, etc. The present scenario of soaring property prices demands immediate policy measures. Firstly, we are hopeful that the government would increase the interest rate deduction cap to Rs 5 lakh. Such a move will significantly lighten the financial load on homebuyers. Additionally, redefining ‘affordable housing’ to accommodate the realty prices could dramatically widen the pool of beneficiaries.

Moreover, we expect continuous support through incentives for affordable rental housing and significant tax benefits for first-time homebuyers. The reintroduction of GST with an input tax credit can catalyze construction activities by reducing the overall project costs, which ultimately benefits buyers. Proposals can also include broad tax reliefs, a streamlined single-window clearance process, a reduction in home loan interest rates, and a revitalization of subvention schemes. The focused announcements will make homes more accessible, aligning with the government’s vision of ‘Housing for All’ as envisioned in schemes like PMAY.

Gaurav K Singh, Founder & Chairman, Womeki Group

Key expectations include tax incentives, such as reductions in GST rates on construction materials and real estate transactions, which would lower costs and improve affordability. We also hope for increased tax deductions on home loan interest and principal repayments to encourage home purchases. Additionally, we expect enhanced regulatory and infrastructural support from the government. Implementing a single window clearance system to streamline project approvals will reduce delays and increase efficiency. We also hope for increased investment in urban infrastructure, such as roads, water supply, and sewage systems, alongside affordable housing schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) to support new housing developments. Incentives for green building practices and smart city initiatives are anticipated to promote sustainable and technologically advanced urban development, enhancing the sector’s long-term appeal and functionality.

Mohit Malhotra, Founder & CEO, NeoLiv

As a new age developer in the growing real estate sector of India, our expectations for the upcoming budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 are framed with a keen understanding of the growing middle income category and its needs for housing requirements. One of the key proposals for the input tax credit under GST is a pivotal requirement for development companies who are pivoting this new era of the sector. Granting developers access to input tax credit is not merely a fiscal incentive; it’s a strategic move that can stimulate the sector’s growth for homebuyers, and fuel economic recovery. In the context of the mid-housing segment, a pivotal focus for us, we look forward to creation of new pockets of development with focus on higher budgetary allocation for infrastructure development enabling smooth access to city centres. Mid-range housing projects play a vital role in addressing the housing needs of the middle-income demographic, and we hope that the budget recognises the future potential of this segment.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-what-kind-of-tax-relief-can-home-owners-expect-and-whats-in-store-for-real-estate-in-this-budget-read-here-for-all-details-3535213/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: With second-largest road network, India looks at incorporating more technology to better its infrastructure","India stands as the country with the second largest road network in the world. As of December 2023, the total length of national highways is at 1,46,145 kilometres, while state highways and other roads measure 1,79,535 kilometres and 63,45,403 kilometres, respectively.

As per the data provided by the government, the National Highway (NH) network increased by approximately 60% from 91,287 km in 2014 to 1,46,145 km in 2023. However, the sector has witnessed its fair share of struggle. With three bridges collapsing in Bihar within a week, cracks appearing in Atal Setu and several projects facing multiple delays in construction, the sector is left staring at a gaping concern. How can the roadway sector ensure the safety and timeliness of its projects? One such solution to its problems is incorporating more technology for a smooth functioning of its projects and existing infrastructure.

The National Highway Authorities of India (NHAI) has been exploring various technologies that can be roped in to better the infrastructure and ensure smoother operations. One such technology was ‘FASTag’,which was introduced in 2014. It is an electronic collection system which employs ‘Radio Frequency Identification’ (RFID) technology for toll payments.



Therefore, it is imperative that the Union Budget focuses not only on expanding the road network and connectivity in India but also on ensuring proper maintenance, safety, and uninterrupted operations.

As the Union Budget 2024 presentation approaches, industry experts and analysts are voicing a range of expectations.

However, recent deficiencies in India’s infrastructure, especially in the roadways sector, have raised several questions. Will the budget address the safety and timeliness of India’s infrastructure projects?

Three bridges collapse in Bihar



In a shocking incident, on June 23, an under-construction bridge collapsed in Bihar’s East Champaran district, making it the third such incident in the state in less than a week. As per the officials, the 16-metre-long bridge was being built at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore.

Similarly, on June 22, a small bridge collapsed in Siwan district. It was built over a canal and connected the villages of Daraunda and Maharajganj blocks. Prior to that, on Tuesday, a newly constructed 180-meter-long bridge collapsed in Araria district right before its inauguration.

Cracks seen on Atal Setu

The newly-built Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri-Nhava Sheva Atal Setu, popularly known as the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), came under heavy scrutiny after cracks appeared on its tar road exit towards Ulwe in Navi Mumbai. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the structure, constructed at approximately Rs 17,840 crore, in January this year. Its opening was welcomed by the people of Mumbai with great zeal, however, now the fervour has been replaced by worry, especially after the Congress party raised concerns regarding corruption in MTHL’s construction.

Several other cases have raised concerns about the ongoing projects under roadways in India. Another issue that mars these projects are multiple delays in their completion.

Earlier in January, the Bombay High Court had observed that the delays in infrastructure projects cause inconvenience to the people and burden the state exchequer with rising construction costs.

The case highlighted in the court was of the Mumbai-Goa National Highway (NH-66), whose repair and widening work was undertaken in 2011.

Given the recent infrastructure failures and delays, the Union Budget 2024 is expected to prioritise the safety and quality of infrastructure projects.Increased funding for maintenance and upgrades of existing infrastructure, along with incentives for innovative construction technologies, could also be anticipated. Furthermore, addressing corruption and improving transparency in project execution will likely be key focus areas to restore public trust and ensure the efficient use of resources.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/business/roadways-budget-2024-from-delays-to-bridges-collapsing-cracks-in-indias-roadway-projects-call-for-prompt-actions-3534595/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: More reasons to opt for new tax regime! Modi govt may offer THESE tax incentives,"Union Budget 2024: With just about a month to go before the union budget, the finance ministry has started its routine meetings and consultations with various stakeholders from the industry and social sectors. Among many proposals before the finance ministry, one pertains to tax relief for salaried taxpayers, according to reports.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present next month the union budget, her seventh and first of the Modi 3.0 government. It is expected that the government will roll out some big tax relief measures for middle-class taxpayers in the upcoming budget.

Standard deduction limit likely to be hiked in budget 2024

According to a report by The Times of India, the government is mulling increasing the standard deduction limit under the new tax regime to make it more attractive. So far, the new tax regime has not received the response the government was expecting despite the introduction of standard deduction of Rs 50,000 in budget 2023 and a high tax rebate.



In the Union Budget 2023, Sitharaman introduced major changes in the new tax regime in the form of standard deduction to encourage taxpayers to switch from the old tax regime. She also offered full tax rebate on incomes up to Rs 7 lakh, increasing tax exemption limit to Rs 3 lakh. The other major announcement in that budget was making the new regime the default option.



What is standard deduction?

The standard deduction, which comes under the head salary, is available as a flat deduction from the total annual compensation of an employee. While calculating tax liability of a salaried employee, a fixed amount – which is currently Rs 50,000 – is deducted as standard deduction, thus lowering the taxable amount for that individual.

Tax exemption limit under new regime may go up

Various reports also suggest that the Modi government may also hike the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime to Rs 5 lakh from the existing Rs 3 lakh in a bid to boost consumption. The government’s potential move may leave more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers who will ultimately spend that money, feel experts.



Impact on tax liability if exemption limit hiked in budget

If Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman decides to hike exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh from the current Rs 3 lakh, the tax liability will come down by Rs 10,400 (including a 4% Health and Education cess) for taxpayers with taxable incomes of approximately Rs 7.6 lakh to Rs 50 lakh. Taxpayers with taxable incomes in the range of Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore will save Rs 11,440 (including cess and a 10% surcharge).

Those with taxable incomes between Rs 1 crore and up to Rs 2 crore can save Rs 11,960 (including cess and a 15% surcharge) in lower taxes. Individuals with earnings of above Rs 2 crore can bring their taxable income down by Rs 13,000 (including cess and a 25% surcharge).",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/budget-2024-more-reasons-to-go-for-new-tax-regime-modi-govt-may-offer-these-tax-incentives-to-woo-taxpayers-3534570/

After a high-level meeting conducted just days after the Bengal incident, Vaishnaw instructed railway officials to expedite the installation of Kavach 4.0, the latest iteration of the system known for its capability to avert potential disasters on the tracks.



This urgency comes as the railway ministry aims to extend Kavach’s coverage to a substantial 44,000 kilometers of track over the next five years. According to multiple media reports, tenders for an additional 6,000 kilometers of track are slated for release by year-end to further bolster safety measures.

What is Kavach System?

The Kavach system, currently at version 3.2, is set for an upgrade to version 4.0 to enhance its capabilities further. Despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, development and testing continued unabated. In 2021, version 3.2 received certification and deployment commenced on high-density routes such as Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Howrah in late 2022.

Looking ahead, the upcoming Union Budget 2024 is anticipated to prioritise railway safety initiatives, with a significant allocation expected for the accelerated deployment of the Kavach system. The ministry’s proactive stance reflects its commitment to modernizing infrastructure and ensuring passenger safety amidst the ambitious targets set for the next five years.

As India advances towards securing its railway network with cutting-edge technology, the spotlight remains on Kavach as a pivotal component in transforming the safety landscape of one of the world’s largest railway systems.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-railway-safety-to-take-center-stage-via-kavach-system-expansion-3533121/

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Railway allocation over the years- Details inside,"The allocation for Indian Railways remains one of the most anticipated announcements in the national Budget. Historically, the Railways had its own separate budget, a practice that spanned 92 years until it was abolished in 2017. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was the first to present a combined Railway and Union Budget, marking the end of a long-standing tradition.

A Historical Perspective

John Mathai, an economist and India’s first Railway Minister, presented the first independent Railway Budget in 1947. Following an interim budget, Mathai introduced his second Railway Budget on February 24, 1948. The tradition of a separate Railway Budget began under British rule in 1924, as railways then contributed significantly to government revenues and the nation’s GDP.



The Merger Decision

The decision to merge the Railway Budget with the Union Budget was based on recommendations from a Niti Aayog commission. The commission’s white paper highlighted that the Railway Budget had diminished in significance over the years. Given that no other country had a separate Railway Budget, it was deemed unnecessary to continue the practice. Thus, starting in 2017, the Railway Budget was integrated with the Union Budget.



Railway Allocations Over the Years

In the Interim Budget 2024-25, Indian Railways received a substantial allocation of Rs Rs 2.52 lakh crore for fiscal year 2024-25, representing a 5.8 percent increase from the previous budgetary estimate of Rs 2.41 trillion for fiscal year 2023-24.

Here’s a look at the allocations over recent years:

FY 2023-24: Rs 2.40 lakh crore

Rs 2.40 lakh crore FY 2022-23: Rs 1.40 lakh crore

Rs 1.40 lakh crore FY 2021-22: Rs 1.10 lakh crore

Rs 1.10 lakh crore FY 2020-21: Rs 1.6 lakh crore

Rs 1.6 lakh crore FY 2019-20: Rs 1.58 lakh crore

India’s Infrastucture development in the last 10- years

Revolutionizing National Highways

Over the last decade, India has witnessed a remarkable expansion in its National Highway (NH) network, growing by 60% from 91,287 km in 2014 to an impressive 1,46,145 km by 2023. This unprecedented growth includes a significant increase in 4-laned NHs, which have expanded by 2.5 times, reaching 46,179 km from 18,387 km in 2014. The pace of highway construction surged to an extraordinary 37 km/day in 2020-21, underscoring India’s commitment to bolstering its road infrastructure.



Rural Roads and Connectivity

Under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), India has constructed a staggering 3.74 lakh km of rural roads since 2014. This initiative has connected over 99% of rural habitations, totaling 7.55 lakh km of rural roads completed thus far, compared to 3.81 lakh km in 2013-14. The PMGSY continues to play a pivotal role in enhancing accessibility and connectivity in rural areas, vital for inclusive growth.

Vande Bharat Trains: Redefining Rail Travel

The introduction of Vande Bharat Trains has revolutionized India’s railway sector, offering enhanced safety features, faster travel times, and superior passenger amenities. With over 100 operational services boasting an impressive occupancy rate of 96.62%, these trains signify a leap forward in modernizing rail infrastructure and improving travel experiences nationwide.

Metro Rail Expansion: Urban Mobility Revolution

India’s Metro Rail network has expanded exponentially from 248 km in 2014 to a projected 945 km by 2024. Serving 21 cities compared to just 5 in 2014, the Metro Rail system now accommodates approximately 1 crore passengers daily, easing urban congestion and promoting sustainable urban transport solutions. The introduction of state-of-the-art Namo Bharat trains on the Delhi-Meerut RRTS corridor further underscores India’s commitment to advancing regional connectivity and urban mobility.

financialexpress.com,Will Budget 2024 bring back train fare concessions for senior citizens?,"With Union Budget 2024-25 around the corner, one of the pressing questions on the minds of many is whether the Indian Railways will bring back concessions on train fares for senior citizens. The issue holds significant importance as it directly impacts millions of elderly individuals across the country who rely on affordable travel options.

The Indian Railways had in March 2020 decided to withdraw the concessions on train fares that were previously offered to senior citizens. This decision ended the practice of providing a 50 percent discount to female senior citizens and a 40 percent discount to male and transgender senior citizens on their train fares. Since the withdrawal of these concessions, senior citizens have been required to pay the full fare, on par with other passengers. According to Railway norms, males and transgenders aged 60 and above, and females aged 58 and above, are classified as senior citizens.



Financial Considerations vs Social Responsibility



The withdrawal of senior citizen concessions reportedly resulted in significant additional revenue for the Railways, as disclosed through various reports and RTI inquiries. This financial boost has been a point of contention, with proponents of reinstating concessions arguing that the social benefits outweigh the revenue gains.

When asked about the possibility of reinstating senior citizen concessions ahead of the Interim Budget 2024, former Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw responded by saying that the Indian Railways is already offering a 55% concession on train fares to all passengers.

Earlier this year, in response to an RTI application filed by Madhya Pradesh resident Chandra Shekhar Gaur, the Indian Railways had revealed that it earned around Rs 2,242 crore from about 15 crore senior citizens in the financial year 2022-23.

The question of whether Indian Railways will bring back concessions for senior citizens in Budget 2024 is not merely a matter of policy but also a reflection of societal values and priorities. It represents a pivotal opportunity for the government to demonstrate its commitment to elder care, social equity, and responsive governance.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/will-budget-2024-bring-back-train-fare-concessions-for-senior-citizens-3530833/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Did roadways get enough allocation in Interim Budget? Here’s a recap,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2024, presented the Interim Budget 2024-25, which saw a very slight increase in the budget allocation for the road sector as compared to the last year.

As we get closer to the presentation of the full Union Budget 2024-25 by Sitharaman, let’s take a look at the budget allocated to the road sector earlier this year.

In the Interim Budget, the government set aside Rs 2,78,000 crore for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, a jump of 2.7% as compared to the Rs 2,70,434 crore allocated in 2023-24. However, the revised allocation for the ministry for the fiscal year 2023-24 was Rs 2,76,351.45 crore. When compared to that, the new allocation was just 0.5% higher.



In the budget announced in 2023, the allocation increased by 35%, following a 70% hike the previous year.

Increase in Infrastructure expenditure

Sitharaman had also proposed to increase the outlay for infrastructure development by 11 per cent which will amount to Rs.11,11,111 crore, making up 3.4% of the GDP. She further stated that this increase in allocation reflected the significant multiplier effect of infrastructure development on economic growth and job creation.



As India makes great strides in the run for the largest road network in the world, with more plans for roadways, more budgetary allocation is expected in the upcoming budget.

India’s road network

According to data provided by the government in January 2024, India has approximately 66.71 lakh kilometers of road network, making it the second largest in the world.

The length of various categories of roads is as follows:

National Highways: 1,46,145 km

State Highways: 1,79,535 km

Other Roads: 63,45,403 km

The National Highway network in the country has seen a rise of approximately 60% from 91,287 km in 2014 to 1,46,145 km in 2023.



Bharatmala Pariyojana update

The Bharatmala Pariyojana focuses on optimising the efficiency of the movement of goods and people across the country. Phase 1 of the project was approved in October 2017. This phase focuses on filling vital infrastructure gaps through development of 34,800 km of National Highways.

The status of Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase 1 includes a total length of 34,800 km across 31 states and UTs, covering over 550 districts.

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: Developers seek tax sops for homebuyers, boost for affordable housing","The NDA government’s return to power for a third consecutive term has raised expectations for a forward-looking Union Budget that will outline a strategic roadmap for the next five years. Like many others, the developer community is eagerly anticipating the budget announcements and voicing their essential requests that could influence the sector’s direction in times to come.

Developers and realty consultants believe the government has the ability to accelerate the real estate sector by allocating resources and enacting beneficial policies, which can lead to job growth and boost economic activities.

“Expectations are high for tax reliefs and other sentiment boosters. The future of the overall industry also depends on unfettered infrastructure deployment to support and improve urban living standards as well as to develop and promote newer areas,” says Anuj Puri, Chairman, ANAROCK Group.



The Indian housing sector remained upbeat in 2024 till date, with housing sales and new launches creating new peaks in the top 7 cities. Sales reached an all-time high at about 4.93 lakh units in FY23-24, while 4.47 lakh units were launched.

However, “this momentum must continue in the future too – and the current growth trajectory is skewed towards mid-range and premium housing. Considering the specific housing needs of India’s lower-income groups, this momentum cannot ride solely on higher-priced homes while affordable housing continues to languish,” observes Puri.



Many interest stimulants previously extended to buyers and developers of affordable housing have expired in the last two years. This important segment must be revived with high-impact measures like tax breaks – for developers, so that they will focus more on affordable housing, and for buyers to improve affordability.

Amit Goyal, Managing Director, India Sotheby’s International Realty, says they expect announcements that will encourage capital investments and increase foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India. In the real estate sector, it is crucial to sustain demand for homes, as housing acts as an accelerator for over 200 ancillary sectors.

“One significant measure that has been pending for a long time and would benefit both the industry and home buyers is the introduction of a standalone deduction for home loan principal repayment, along with raising the tax breaks on the interest amounts of home loans from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. This move would help mitigate the impact of increased home loan EMIs and provide much-needed relief to home buyers. There is no better time than now to implement this change, which would provide much-needed relief and stimulate growth in the housing market,” adds Goyal.

Securing industry status will unlock a plethora of legal and administrative benefits, along with much-needed tax incentives. Also, “while the government’s focus on affordable housing under PMAY is commendable, recalibrating strategies in light of escalating construction costs is imperative for sustained inclusiveness and effectiveness. Moreover, enhanced tax reliefs and increased deductions on home loans are pivotal in stimulating demand and supporting prospective buyers. With these measures in place, the real estate sector is poised to contribute meaningfully to India’s journey towards a 5 trillion-dollar economy,” says Shubhi Jain, Principal Partner & Head of CRM, Square Yards.

Developers also anticipate a budget that tackles pressing issues, boosts demand, and drives sustainable growth.

Shrinivas Rao, FRICS, CEO, Vestian, says, “As per the announcements in the interim budget, it is evident that the government will continue to focus on infrastructure development to make India a USD 5 Tn economy in the upcoming years and turn the country into a ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. To achieve this goal, the real estate sector is likely to play a pivotal role.”

The government has already announced the construction of 3 crore new units under PMAY. This shows the government’s commitment towards the real estate sector. “Demand for residential units is expected to increase further, if the government increases tax exemption limits for home loans in the Union Budget 2024-25. Moreover, granting industry status to the real estate sector would ease availability of funds and increase participation of foreign investors,” Rao added.

The upcoming budget should provide greater benefits to the salaried class as they have played a pivotal role in record-high direct tax collections.

“One such step would be to increase the tax exemption limit on both the principal amount and interest paid on home loans. Amid substantial rise in property value over the last couple of years, the current Rs 2 lakh tax rebate on housing loan interest should be enhanced to a minimum of Rs 5 lakh. Such a step will boost demand for residential properties. Similarly, a separate section should be introduced for the deduction against home loan principal repayment as the present Rs 1.5 lakh limit under section 80(C) is inadequate,” says Mohit Jain, Managing Director, Krisumi Corporation.

Given the government’s ongoing push for Housing for All, the relaunch of the CLSS scheme, which will boost housing demand across various segments, is also expected.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/budget-2024-developers-seek-tax-sops-for-homebuyers-boost-for-affordable-housing-3530132/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: FM Sitharaman to surpass Morarji Desai’s record with her 7th consecutive Budget; Read to know more about it,"With the presentation of the Union Budget for 2024-25 next month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will set a new record. With the presentation of her seventh Budget, she will become the first finance minister in the country’s history who will deliver seven consecutive Budgets.

Currently, she is matching the record set by former Finance Minister Morarji Desai, who had presented six budgets in a row. Once she presents Budget 2024 in the parliament, which is slated for the third week of July 2024 (per sources), she will surpass the record of Morarji Desai and will become first finance minister to present 7 budgets in a row. Nirmala Sitharaman has been a Union Minister in all three of the 2014, 2019, and 2024 Modi cabinets. She was sworn in as the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs of Modi 3.0 cabinet in New Delhi, on June 12, 2024.

Nirmala Sitharaman became the country’s first full-time woman finance minister. She has already surpassed the five-Budget presentation record of Manmohan Singh, Arun Jaitley, P Chidambaram, and Yashwant Sinha. And with her sixth Budget presentation earlier this year, she matched Morarji Desai’s record of presenting six Budgets in a row approximately 60 years ago. Morarji Desai holds the record for the most Budgets presented by any Indian finance minister, totalling ten, for over 50 years. He was also the fourth Prime Minister of India from March 24, 1977, to July 28, 1979.



Meanwhile, Nirmala Sitharamn has served as the finance minister of the country for five years, during which she presented six budgets spanning 2019 to 2023, including the interim budget for 2024. Additionally, she also held the position of Minister of State for Finance for a period of six to seven months.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-fm-sitharaman-to-surpass-morarji-desais-record-with-her-7th-consecutive-budget-read-to-know-more-about-it-3529803/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Modi govt to raise tax exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh under new tax regime?,"Union Budget 2024: The Modi 3.0 government’s maiden budget will be presented next month, most likely in the last week. With about a month to go for the mega economic event, various stakeholders, including taxpayers, will have their eyes on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will be presenting her seventh straight union budget in Parliament.

Will FM Sitharaman give some tax relief?

The finance minister is likely to hike the tax exemption limit under the new tax regime to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 3 lakh in a bid to boost consumption, according to media reports. It is expected that hiking the tax exemption limit will leave more disposable income in the hands of people, especially those falling under the low income category.

New Tax Regime:



Up to Rs 3 lakh – Nil

Between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 6 lakh – 5% (Tax rebate u/s 87A)

Between Rs 6 lakh and Rs 9 lakh – 10% (Tax rebate u/s 87A up to Rs 7 lakh)

Between Rs 9 lakh and Rs 12 lakh – 15%

Between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 15 lakh – 20%

Above Rs 15 lakh – 30%

So if the government exempts income up to Rs 5 lakh in this upcoming budget, then there will be only five slabs remaining against the existing six slabs. There will be a tax rebate u/s 87A on income between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 9 lakh, if the other slabs are not tinkered with and attract the same taxation rates.



Tax liability if exemption limit hiked to Rs 5 lakh in budget

If the Modi government hikes the exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh from the current Rs 3 lakh, it will lower the tax liability by Rs 10,400 (including a 4% Health and Education cess) for taxpayers with taxable incomes of approximately Rs 7.6 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.

Those with taxable incomes in the range of Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore, the benefit comes to Rs 11,440 (including cess and a 10% surcharge).

Individuals with earnings of more than Rs 1 crore and up to Rs 2 crore would see their tax liability coming down by Rs 11,960 (including cess and a 15% surcharge).

Lastly, those with earnings of above Rs 2 crore can lower their tax liability by Rs 13,000 (including cess and a 25% surcharge).

The Modi government brought the new tax regime in Budget 2020 with more slabs and lower tax rates, but without any tax deduction and exemption provisions. Three years later in 2023, the government introduced the Standard Deduction of Rs 50000 under the new tax regime to attract more taxpayers. The government also made the new tax regime the default option for taxpayers last year, which means in case an individual doesn’t choose a preference, he or she will be deemed to have chosen the new tax regime.

In the upcoming budget also, it is highly unlikely that the Centre will make any changes to the slabs or tax rates under the old tax regime as it wants taxpayers to shift ultimately to the new taxation regime. Old tax regime still allows taxpayers to avail various deductions and exemptions available under the Income Tax Act, 1961.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/budget-2024-modi-govt-to-raise-tax-exemption-limit-to-rs-5-lakh-under-new-tax-regime-3529184/

financialexpress.com,Modi 3.0 Budget 2024: Income tax cut likely for THESE taxpayers,"Modi 3.0 Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is all set to present her seventh straight union budget next month. She has so far presented five full-fledged budgets and one interim one as the finance minister in Modi 2.0 government. With just over a month to go until the budget, anticipations and speculations are high that Sitharaman will give taxpayers some relief this time as the last time anything significant taxpayers witnessed was in budget 2020, when she announced a new tax regime with lower tax slabs.

Who will be the key beneficiaries of possible tax rate cuts in the budget?

Certain categories of taxpayers might get some good news from the finance minister in this upcoming budget.

According to a Reuters report based on government sources, lowering personal tax rates for certain categories of individuals is being considered as the aim is to boost consumption.

Individuals earning more than Rs 15 lakh per annum might get tax relief, the report said citing one of the sources.



The changes could be made to the new tax regime introduced in 2020. Under the new regime, annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at 5-20% while earnings over Rs 15 lakh attract 30% tax.



The personal tax rate jumps six-fold when an individual’s income increases by five times from Rs 3 lakh to 15 lakh, “which is quite steep,” the report said citing another source.

A cut in income tax would see consumption going up due to extra cash in consumer hands. Lowering of taxes for certain categories would also increase savings for the middle class, the report further said.

While the economy grew at 8.2% in 2023-24, consumption has grown at half that pace, the report said.

Speculations over possible tax rate cuts are also high because PM Modi, while staking a claim to form his government for the third term by getting alliances’ support, had said his government would focus on shoring up middle-class savings and bettering their lives.

Industry expectations on the taxation front in budget 2024

India Inc is also hoping to see FM Sitharaman announcing some tax relief measures for the taxpayers, especially smaller ones.

Newly-elected CII President Sanjiv Puri in an interview with PTI said income tax relief for the people in the lowest slab may need to be considered in the upcoming full Budget for 2024-25 considering the high levels of inflation.

In the interim budget, presented in February this year ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, FM Sitharaman did not announce any changes either in the tax rates or slabs, but now, taxpayers – especially salaried and middle-class – are expecting that she will provide some relief.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/modi-3-0-budget-2024-income-tax-cut-likely-for-these-taxpayers-3527869/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: Logistics industry hope for consistency in growth policy, continued infra push, tax reforms, financial incentives","With India awaiting the announcement of the date for the presentation of the Union Budget 2024 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the logistics industry is expecting consistency in policy, technology and infrastructure-led reforms, from the newly formed NDA government. Industry leaders said in order for India to become a $7 trillion economy by 2030, the logistics industry is set to play a role as a growth catalyst. The government should, the industry voiced, focus on reforms and proposals towards a continued capex push for transportation, port and digital infrastructure development to boost logistics efficiency and competitiveness in line with the vision and goals of National Logistics Policy. Nishith Rastogi, Founder & CEO, Locus, said, “With the new National Logistics Policy and initiatives like PM Gati Shakti already setting the groundwork, the industry is on the verge of transformative growth. Continued government support is essential to foster innovation and assist startups in navigating this evolving landscape, ensuring that the sector remains competitive and resilient.”

Important areas of concentration include making large infrastructural expenditures to improve efficiency, such as building multimodal logistics parks and designated freight corridors, added Zaiba Sarang, Co-founder, iThink Logistics.

Besides these, the industry is also looking at tax reforms, financial incentives, and incentives towards adoption of cutting-edge technology like AI and IoT.



The finance minister is likely to table the Union Budget 2024 in the third week of July, during the monsoon session of Parliament. The session will begin on July 22 and is expected to continue till August 9. According to media reports, the Budget will be presented on the first day of the session. Earlier on February 1, Nirmala Sitharaman had presented the Interim Budget for FY24 ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.

Here is what logistics companies are expecting from the Union Budget…

Ketan Kulkarni, Chief Growth Officer, Allcargo Logistics

As India is aspiring to become a $7 trillion economy by 2030, the logistics industry is set to play the role of a growth catalyst which will usher in the new era of economic progress. For that, the logistics industry requires consistency in policy, technology and infrastructure-led reforms. It is extremely encouraging to note that the NDA government in its third consecutive term has emphasised on the continuity and stability in the decision-making and policy measures and we expect the reflection of that intent in the full Budget.

The logistics industry is at the cusp of technology transformation and structural transition thanks to the launch of National Logistics Policy and PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan. The full budget needs to continue with the infrastructure push to add momentum to the transformation-led growth. The logistics industry requires a holistic infrastructure development push to build a stronger distribution network and global value chain linkages.

There should be policy continuity in developing economic railway corridor programmes to boost rail freight share and reduce carbon emission as well as enhance operational and cost efficiency. A dedicated focus on sustainability will help the sector adopt green practices, reducing its carbon footprint and aligning with global environmental standards. The logistics industry is geared up to contribute to the ‘Viksit Bharat @ 2047’ mission.

Vineet Agarwal, MD, Transport Corporation of India

As we approach the Union Budget 2024-25 announcement, we, at TCI, are optimistic about the government’s commitment to bolstering the logistics sector. An emphasis on infrastructure development, streamlined regulations, upskilling programs for the workforce and enhanced investment in technology will be pivotal in driving efficiency and sustainability in our industry. We look forward to policies that support innovation, facilitate ease of doing business, and create a robust framework for the growth of the logistics and transportation sector, ultimately contributing to the nation’s economic resurgence.

Darshan Ghodawat, CEO and Managing Director, AVA Global Logistics LLP

The upcoming interim budget presents a crucial opportunity to balance economic growth with fiscal consolidation by prioritizing capital expenditure in key infrastructure projects and providing financial incentives like PLI, tax benefits, and subsidies. Creating a cohesive ‘One India’ logistics ecosystem and integrating initiatives such as the National Logistics Policy and Sagarmala Project are vital to enhancing India’s global Logistics Performance Index ranking. Emphasizing domestic manufacturing and preparing the logistics sector for service integration, fulfilment logistics, and multi-modal transportation will reinforce India’s potential as a manufacturing powerhouse. Automation investments in technologically advanced warehouses can position India as a logistics innovation leader. Additionally, formal recognition of the gig workforce under labour laws and significant support for the EV industry are essential. Including diesel under GST is a critical move to regulate costs and improve competitiveness. Strategic resource allocation towards infrastructure, competence, and traceability will sustain progress, driving India towards a $5 trillion economy.

Nishith Rastogi, Founder & CEO, Locus

As we await the 2024 Union Budget, the focus for India’s logistics sector remains clear: a forward-looking budget that champions technological integration and robust infrastructure development. With the new National Logistics Policy and initiatives like PM Gati Shakti already setting the groundwork, the industry is on the verge of transformative growth.

This budget represents a pivotal opportunity to future-proof our logistics industry. Beyond infrastructure enhancements and tax reforms, there is an urgent need for strategic resource allocation to adapt to market dynamics, including fuel price fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. By investing in cutting-edge technology and aligning with global digitalization and sustainability standards, we can mitigate current challenges and position India as a leader in a tech-driven, efficient logistics sector on the global stage. Additionally, incentives for green logistics and digital infrastructure development will be key to achieving our long-term goals.

Zaiba Sarang, Co-founder, iThink Logistics

The logistics industry has great hopes as the Union Budget 2024 draws near. Important areas of concentration include making large infrastructural expenditures to improve efficiency, such as building multimodal logistics parks and designated freight corridors. For enhanced operations and transparency, embracing cutting-edge technology like AI and IoT needs incentives. Streamlining the GST system and encouraging sustainability by using electric cars and other eco-friendly activities is also essential. Innovation and growth will also be fueled by assistance for SMEs, startups, and skill development as well as by encouraging public-private collaborations and streamlining regulatory procedures. By addressing these issues, the industry will contribute more to India’s economic development.

Gayomard Driver, Executive Director & Group Chief Financial Officer, Jeena & Company

The logistics industry is anticipating further focus on dedicated corridors for ports and railways. We have already witnessed the remarkable change this initiative has brought to transportation costs within the country, and we anticipate it will remain a significant focus in the current term as well. Looking ahead, we foresee a considerable reduction in costs—between 15% to 20%—as more projects are completed and operational efficiencies increase. Additionally, the industry needs a tech boost, leveraging AI to streamline customs, improvise warehousing, and optimize every facet of the supply chain. The Department of Science & Technology’s implementation of the multi-stakeholder National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (NM-ICPS) is pivotal in making India a leading player in CPS technologies. Continued efforts and investments in this area are crucial. Finally, the budget must orchestrate collaboration between various stakeholders—ports, railways, airlines, and e-commerce giants—through public-private partnerships and an inter-ministerial task force.

Raju Sinha, Chief Business Officer, Fship Logistics

My expectations are centered around a few key areas that could significantly impact the logistics and e-commerce sectors. I hope to see a continued focus on enhancing the ease of doing business. Streamlining regulations and reducing compliance burdens for startups and SMEs will encourage innovation and growth. Simplifying and reducing the tax structure, particularly around GST, can help businesses manage their finances more efficiently and encourage more entrepreneurs to enter the market.

Investments in infrastructure are crucial. Improved road and rail networks will enable more efficient supply chains, benefiting both businesses and consumers. Pushing forward initiatives like the National Logistics Policy, which aims to reduce logistics costs and boost the sector’s competitiveness, is essential.

Additionally, supporting MSMEs through accessible financing options and skill development programs will strengthen the backbone of our economy. MSMEs play a crucial role in the logistics supply chain, and empowering them will have a ripple effect across the industry.

Siddhartha Bhagat, Head, Logistics Division, Seros

The National Logistics Policy in 2022 under PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan had already laid out the key objectives. The primary aim is to reduce logistics cost from 14% of GDP to 8-10% of the GDP. Further, there should be focus on infrastructure development for faster TAT and seamless movement of goods. India with its vast coastline and internal waterways have a huge potential in the push for multimodal Logistics thereby developing and integrating the local and global supply chain. Further, it would be beneficial to reduce the GST rates on HCV and MCV for EV and Alternate fuels to encourage the industry to migrate to cleaner fuels.

Ravi Goel, Chief Business Officer, RapidShyp

The e-commerce industry in India has changed the business landscape, increasing consumption by providing direct access to end-consumers and creating fresh job opportunities. In anticipation of the upcoming Union Budget, we look forward to measures that can strengthen ongoing efforts towards improving last-mile connectivity in the logistics sector. For D2C brands and small sellers driving the Indian economy, this is non-negotiable, as they will be key growth drivers for our economy. The government’s steadfast backing through technology adoption, digitisation, innovative digital payment methods and local logistics infrastructure development has played a major role in boosting the logistics industry. It is anticipated that the new budget will continue these initiatives while ensuring the smooth integration of local and global value chains. By doing so, these are the aspects that will keep us going, help SMEs grow and contribute to the nation’s overall economic development.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-logistics-industry-hope-for-consistency-in-growth-policy-continued-infra-push-tax-reforms-financial-incentives-3527356/
financialexpress.com,Modi 3.0: 80C Deduction benefits to be extended to new tax regime in Budget 2024?,"Modi 3.0 Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the first budget of Modi 3.0 government in the second half of July. Industries, farmers and other stakeholders across sectors are eagerly anticipating potential booster announcements from the Narendra Modi government in the upcoming budget. Among these hopeful groups are taxpayers also, who are particularly expecting relief from the Finance Minister in form of tax sops. The middle-class, in particular, has not seen significant tax reductions in the last two budgets.

In the Union Budget 2020, the Modi government introduced a new tax regime alongside the existing one, aiming to provide taxpayers with an alternative. Initially, the government anticipated a broader adoption of the new regime due to its lower tax slabs, albeit without the traditional deductions and exemption benefits. The assumption proved incorrect, as the new tax regime did not attract taxpayers to the extent anticipated. Subsequently, the government made adjustments to the regime, favoring taxpayers by introducing a standard deduction benefit and a rebate on taxable income up to Rs 7 lakh.





Benefits under the new tax regime

Under the new tax regime, individuals with an income of Rs 7 lakh or less pay zero tax. Salaried individuals benefit from a standard deduction of Rs 50,000, effectively allowing tax-free income up to Rs 7.5 lakh. However, for taxable incomes above Rs 7.5 lakh, income tax applies on the entire income, albeit at a reduced rate.

Under the new tax regime, there are six slabs. Under the new tax regime, the tax rates are structured as follows: income up to Rs 3 lakh attracts zero tax, Rs 3 lakh to Rs 6 lakh is taxed at 5% with a rebate under section 87A, Rs 6 lakh to Rs 9 lakh is imposed 10% tax with a rebate up to Rs 7 lakh, Rs 9 lakh to Rs 12 lakh is taxed at 15%, Rs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh taxable income attracts 20% tax, and income above Rs 15 lakh is taxed at 30%.

Despite offering lower tax slabs, the new tax regime has not gained significant traction among taxpayers. Therefore, it is anticipated that the government might introduce additional deductions under the new tax regime to enhance its appeal and encourage broader adoption among taxpayers.

Currently, the benefit of section 80C is not available under the default (new) tax regime and it would be expected that this benefit be extended to even the default tax regime so that more taxpayers are incentivized to opt for the default (new) tax regime, says Suresh Surana, Founder, RSM India.



He also anticipates that the government may increase the 80C deduction limit under the old tax regime from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh. The last revision to the 80C limit occurred in 2014, when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, during Modi 1.0 government, raised it from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh.

Old Tax Regime: Deductions available under Section 80C

Deduction u/s 80C of the Income-tax Act, 1961 covers multiple savings/investment-based deductions such as LIC, PPF, Employees contribution to RPF/Superannuation Fund, etc. However, the overall limit is restricted to Rs 1,50,000 per annum. The overall deduction limit is still on the lower side as section 80C covers a basket of eligible investments on which deduction is allowed such as 5 years fixed deposits, Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), principal repayment on housing loan, life insurance, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, provident fund contribution, etc. Surana added. “As such, it is expected that the current limit of deduction u/s 80C be increased to Rs 2 lakh per annum.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/modi-3-0-budget-2024-80c-deduction-benefits-to-be-extended-to-new-tax-regime-3526770/

Section 80C, 80D deduction limits may be hiked to …","Modi 3.0 Budget: The Narendra Modi-led NDA government will present next month its first budget of the third term, which began after 72 members from the BJP and its alliance parties took oath as Cabinet and junior ministers. Nirmala Sitharaman’s finance portfolio has not been changed, paving the way for her to present her 6th full-fledged Union budget in July. She also presented the interim budget in February this year ahead of the Lok Sabha polls 2024.

Focus shifts to Union Budget 2024-25

After the new government formation, the focus is now shifted to the Union Budget 2024-25. Taxpayers are hopeful that the Modi government will give them a tax relief in the upcoming budget. Experts too are of the view that FM Sitharaman would at least make some revision in deduction limits under Section 80C and 80D.

The last time the government revised the Section 80C deduction limit was in Union Budget 2014-15, raising the threshold of tax benefit under this Section to Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 1 lakh then. For middle-class taxpayers, 80C is the most crucial section in terms of deduction benefits. Under Section 80C, taxpayers get tax benefits on investments like PPF, NPS, small savings, life insurance, ELSS, ULIPs, home loan principal repayment and several others.





Section 80C deduction limit insufficient



The existing deduction limit of Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C is widely seen as insufficient by taxpayers in light of rising inflation and financial responsibilities. Therefore, taxpayers and tax experts both are hopeful that the upcoming budget will introduce some major changes as far as direct taxation is concerned.

“Reforms that benefit the middle class, such as increasing the basic exemption limit to reflect the rising cost of living, are particularly anticipated. Additionally, the current deduction limit of Rs 1,50,000 under Section 80C is inadequate compared to the inflation rate and growing financial burdens, necessitating an increase in deductions under Chapter VI-A of the Income Tax Act,” says Sakchi Jain, a CA and financial educator.

Simplifying the tax code is another demand

As the Modi government has started its third term, taxpayers are eagerly anticipating reforms for a clearer and more efficient tax system, she said, adding that simplifying the tax code to make compliance easier for the general public, such as reducing tax slabs and streamlining exemptions, is a key expectation.

Enhancing digital infrastructure within the tax administration to reduce processing times and improve transparency is also crucial, according to her.

Expecting some possible tax relief measures in the upcoming budget, Sujit Bangar, Founder, Taxbuddy.com, said, “Deduction against school fees may be decoupled from section 80C and separate deduction may be offered for this purpose. It shall further boost the spending on school education. Fees other than tuition fees may also be included for this deduction.”

The deduction available u/s 80D may be enhanced to Rs 75,000 from existing Rs 25,000 in order to promote health insurance in view of rising healthcare costs, he said.

On being asked whether the government will continue with two tax regimes, Bangar is of the view that two regimes are certainly creating confusion in the minds of return filing taxpayers. “It shall be better if we keep single tax rates regime instead of two.”

Further, he said that the deduction against self-occupied house property may be enhanced to Rs 3 lakh since the annual lettable value has also increased.

Bangar also wants the government to initiate measures towards simplifying the tax filing process and reduce administrative burdens on taxpayers.

Every year many individuals receive their Form 16 very late as many companies would be issuing Form 16 to their employees as late as July, he said. Many taxpayers have issues concerning TDS done vis a vis tax regime to be followed and many instances have been noticed where pre-fill is not fully updated with latest data, he pointed out.

“These issues are creating certain difficulties for salaried tax payers while filing ITRs. Individuals with professional/ freelancing income have witnessed similar issues regarding delay in getting Form 16A. In view of these hardships, it’s advisable that the due date for filing ITR can be extended by a month to 31st August,” he added.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/budget-2024-big-tax-relief-for-middle-class-coming-experts-see-modi-govt-raising-section-80c-80d-deductions-to-3522766/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 – A Cautious Vote-on-Account,"– By Chinmay Joshi

The recently released World Economic Outlook (WEO) January 2024 update by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) painted an optimistic picture of global growth recovery. The global growth is projected to exhibit a marginal uptick from 3.1% in 2023 and 2024 to 3.2% in 2025. In the Indian context, however, the growth is predicted to exhibit a declining trend from 6.7% in 2023 to 6.5% in 2024 and 2025. Against this backdrop, the Union Finance Minister, Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman presented her sixth consecutive union budget which was an interim budget on February 01, 2024. This was a vote-on-account giving the current government an authority to spend for a few months till the new government is elected for the 18th Lok Sabha.

The budget estimates (BE) of 2024-25 shows that the revenue receipts are expected to increase by 11.17% in 2024-25 over the revised estimates (RE) of 2023-24 especially due to the robust rise in tax and non-tax revenue. The budget expects significant rise in tax revenue (net to centre) by around 12% in 2024-25 over the RE of 2023-24 whereas the growth in non-tax revenue is expected to increase by 6.36% in the same period. Additionally, it is to be noted that the non-tax revenue rose significantly in RE of 2023-24 over the BE of 2023-24 by 24.57% largely due to dividends and profits.



The budgeted increase in the gross tax revenue is expected to come from the robust growth in corporation tax, income tax and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). However, the growth in direct taxes will be contingent upon generating more formal sector employment opportunities, widening of tax base, simplifying tax payment procedures among others. Similarly, the achievement of higher GST going ahead will significantly depend on the domestic consumption expenditure in the economy. In this context, it is important to note that as per the First Advance Estimates (FAE) of national income released by the MOSPI, NSO on January 5, 2024, the Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) is expected to decline from 7.52% in 2022-23 to 4.4% in 2023-24 on Y-o-Y basis in real terms along with the decline of PFCE share in the GDP from 58.5% in 2022-23 to 56.9% in 2023-24.

The non-tax revenue is expected to be boosted significantly by dividends and profits followed by other non-tax revenue. The dividends and profits are budgeted to rise by 64.83% in 2024-25 over the BE of 2023-24 in which significant contribution is expected to come from the dividends or surplus from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Nationalized Banks and Financial Institutions to the tune of Rs. 1,02,000 crores which will be an increase of 112.5% in 2024-25 over the BE of 2023-24. Also, it is important to note that the dividends or surplus from these institutions in the revised estimates (RE) of 2023-24 rose by 117.51% over the BE of 2023-24. This indicates that the dividends or surplus from the central bank and other banking and financial institutions have become a major source of non-tax revenue for the central government.

On the other hand, the capital receipts are expected to decline by 1.46% in 2024-25 over the RE of 2023-24. This can be attributed to significant reduction in the disinvestment proceeds. The disinvestment proceeds declined by 50.82% as per the RE of 2023-24 over the BE of 2023-24. In the upcoming year also, the target set out for disinvestment proceeds is significantly reduced by around 18% over the BE of 2023-24. The reduction in the revenue generated through disinvestment proceeds has a potential to impact the achievement of fiscal deficit target negatively going ahead. Besides, in 2024-25, the government aims to reduce the proportion of other receipts (including internal debts and public account) and external debt in financing the fiscal deficit.

In order to boost the economic growth, the government has resorted to increase the capital expenditure (CE) by 11% in BE of 2024-25 over the BE of 2023-24. However, it should be noted that there has been a marginal increase in CE in BE of 2024-25 of 3.39% of GDP as compared to 3.37% of GDP in BE of previous year. Furthermore, the decline in the CE in the RE of 2023-24 as compared to the BE of 2023-24 along with increase in the revenue expenditure in RE of 2023-24 as compared to the BE of 2023-24 implies more resources have been directed towards non-productive purposes rather than long term investments which are growth augmenting. Apart from that there is an absence of additional expansionary fiscal policy measures in this interim budget keeping in mind the challenges of elevated inflationary pressures in the economy.

Among the key deficit indicators, the fiscal deficit (FD) will gradually be reduced from 5.8% in 2023-24 to 5.1% in 2024-25. Similarly, the revenue deficit (RD) is also expected to come down to 2% in 2024-25 as a result of a more than proportional rise in the revenue receipts over the revenue expenditure. However, it is important to reduce the FD to 3% of GDP and achieve zero RD as stipulated in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 and its subsequent amendments to ensure efficient fiscal management. In order to achieve the zero RD, either the revenue receipts must be increased substantially or revenue expenditure must be reduced. In this context, the government must find ways to increase revenue receipts as there are inherent limitations for the government to significantly reduce the revenue expenditure. However, the achievement of both these targets as elucidated in the FRBM Act has long remained elusive for the successive governments.

The global economic growth is still fragile despite showing some signs of recovery. Several downside risks emerge such as rising food and energy prices globally; adverse impacts of extreme weather conditions characterised by droughts, floods and El Niño phenomenon etc.; supply chain disruptions due to prolonging and widening of conflicts especially in the Gulf region, among others. In this pressing situation, it is necessary that the fiscal policy envisaged in the upcoming budget by the new government should strengthen the Indian economy to withstand the domestic as well as external shocks.

“Certainly, particulars in regard to the E-Mobility mission and encouragement of EV infrastructure were missing in the speech, however, the budget did point towards creating ambitious policies towards adoption of EVs in the public transportation sector. Furthermore, since the budget has circumscribed the requirement to strengthen manufacturing of EVs and infrastructure, we can be sure that it stands high on the government’s agenda, and we do expect supporting policies to follow soon,”

Shashank Donthi, CEO, Hynetic Electronics: “By the budget, delivered by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, it’s clear that India is taking significant strides toward a green economy, showcasing a commendable commitment to transformative changes. EV’s are set to transform the world in two ways. The first is how we use and deploy energy, which starts with revamping our grids. The second is how mobility is perceived in the masses, which again goes back to decentralising and democratising the adoption of energy-efficient systems. While there is a lot of room to innovate both in the upstream and downstream ecosystems surrounding EV’s, given their adoption worldwide, it’s a big boost to the economy if India becomes a hub of manufacturing EV’s. This is already in the making given how India compares amongst the top producers and consumers of EV’s globally.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/business/express-mobility-auto-industry-stakeholders-react-to-interim-budget-2024-3383897/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 ensures continuation of fiscal discipline, govt’s intention to promote growth through inclusive policies, say experts","Economists and analysts hailed the interim Budget presentation by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and said that it clearly elucidates the government’s intention to promote growth through inclusive policies. The budget ensures the continuation of fiscal discipline and extension of time-tested policies which have boosted the Indian economy in recent years, said analysts. “This is a judicious interim budget. The degree of fiscal consolidation with a target of 5.1 per cent in FY25 is more than anticipated and is positive for softening of bond yields. Further, the reiteration of the fiscal target for FY26 gives the bond market medium term visibility. The consolidation impacts expenditure including capex by the government. As regards FY25, we would expect more policy direction to emerge when the full budget is presented later this year,” said Vetri Subramanian, Chief Investment Officer, UTI AMC.

The finance minister presented the interim Budget on Thursday for the next financial year (2024-25). It was her sixth budget presentation, but was different from all the others because this was an interim budget.

“Being an interim Budget, there were no big bang policy announcements, however the Budget touched upon some key points. On the top comes the path towards fiscal consolidation which was something that the whole investor community was waiting on whether the budget can deliver on the growth agenda keeping in mind the fiscal prudence. The Government has kept its growth agenda at the forefront along with showing seriousness towards maintaining the fiscal deficit glide path,” said Vaibhav Shah, Fund Manager, Torus ORO PMS.



Here are views from economists and analysts on the interim Budget…

Anurag Mittal, Head of Fixed Income, UTI AMC

The budget is distinctly positive for the fixed income market. The budget continued its push on public capex while balancing fiscal responsibility. The fiscal deficit target of 5.1 per cent for FY25 was below all consensus estimates and the most positive aspect was the gross borrowing number of 14.1 trillion well below market estimates of 15-15.2 trillion.

Pranav Haridasan, MD and CEO, Axis Securities

As anticipated, this vote-on-account budget presented no major surprises for equity markets. However, it infused enthusiasm into the bond market and all interest rate sensitives with its announcements regarding fiscal prudence and subsidy reductions. The fiscal deficit is on a consolidation path with a projection of 5.1 per cent in FY25 vs 5.8 per cent for FY24, which is commendable. Coupled with net borrowings of Rs 11.75 lakh crore, which is less than market expectations, the bond markets have much to rejoice. The overall borrowing figures were lower than the previous year, another positive from a fixed-income perspective. A drop in subsidies from 1.48 per cent to 1.25 per cent of the GDP reflects a commitment to fiscal responsibility. While there is a slight cause for concern in the market regarding the marginally lower-than-expected overall capital expenditure, it still represents a substantial commitment to key developmental initiatives. Overall, with its focus on building upon the current economic trajectory, the budget retains the growth roadmap.

Indranil Pan, Chief Economist, YES Bank

This budget lacks major announcements but clearly elucidates the government’s intention to promote growth through inclusive policies. In this sense, one should expect continuity from the government if re-elected. Another appealing aspect is the roadmap laid out by the finance minister to achieve the 4.5 per cent fiscal deficit to GDP target by FY26. Accordingly, the 5.1 per cent target for FY25 represents a significant step towards achieving the 4.5 per cent goal. At the same time, the FM continues to take responsibility for leading capital expenditures.

Dipti Deshpande, Principal Economist, CRISIL Ltd

A lower fiscal deficit hinging on moderation in revenue spend and realistic GDP growth and tax collection assumptions were the highlights of this interim budget. The budget relies on a mix of capex and rural spending to bolster growth. Growth in capex is slower, but its share in GDP is higher on-year, suggesting continued dominant role of government investment.

The return of budgetary support to rural employment and incomes after a brief hiatus will support rural demand, which has turned sluggish of late. Despite the rural focus and a pre-election setting, the budget refrains from being inflationary. This also ensures a favourable setting for monetary policy. In addition, a lower fiscal deficit and lower market borrowings will comfort government bond yields in the coming fiscal.

Lalit Kumar, Partner, JSA Advocates and Solicitors

The disinvestment has not progressed as expected for FY24 despite robust Indian capital markets. Successful and robust disinvestments lead to good values being generated, bringing quality scrips to the securities market and enriching retail investors economic value. It generates funds for the government to fund its budget targets, a deficit on the other hand will hold up projects. Large public sector enterprises with substantial government holding going for disinvestment has several merits and brings new management if the disinvestment gets in new management also.

Vaibhav Shah, Fund Manager, Torus ORO PMS

Being an Interim Budget, there were no big bang policy announcements, however the Budget touched upon some key points. On the top comes the path towards fiscal consolidation which was something that the whole investor community was waiting on whether the budget can deliver on the growth agenda keeping in mind the fiscal prudence. Gross Fiscal Deficit for next year at 5.1 per cent with a mention of moving towards the target of 4.5 per cent by FY26 was a bold move keeping in mind that most of the expectations were on the higher side specially this being an election year. The Government has kept its growth agenda at the forefront along with showing seriousness towards maintaining the fiscal deficit glide path.

Secondly, an allocation of Rs 11.1 trillion for capex outlay sets the tone for growth-oriented reforms and signals continuation of development policies. The borrowing numbers were also kept modest in spite of inclusion in the JPM Bond index which could have shouldered any additional borrowing without causing any wild movement in yields. Overall, tax buoyancy looks better and disinvestment targets have also been on conservative side. Thus, we believe that it was a growth-oriented budget with a clear focus on kickstarting the capex cycle.

Rajesh Sinha, Senior Research Analyst, Bonanza Portfolio

Budget has reduced the fiscal deficit target at 5.1 per cent of GDP for FY25. It revised down the fiscal deficit target for FY24 to 5.8 per cent from 5.9 per cent of GDP. This has the potential for lower interest rates due to a larger-than anticipated decrease in fiscal deficit, enhancing the overall macroeconomic stability. Also, Gross Market borrowing for FY25 Rs 14.13 lakh crore and Net Market borrowing at Rs 11.75 lakh crore. This move can be a positive for public sector banks.

Budget announced a capex allocation of Rs 2.55 lakh crore for the Indian Railways in the new financial year, against Rs 2.4 lakh crore allocated in the last budget.

Sandeep Das, MD & CEO, Centrum Wealth

For an interim budget, the announcements made today reinforced the Government’s resolve on fiscal consolidation and pro-growth outlays that steered away from populist spending, especially ahead of a major election. Thus, as against street expectations, the Government projected a lower fiscal deficit of 5.1 per cent of GDP in FY25. The 11 per cent increase in infrastructure spending also was a welcome surprise. Support for innovation and start-ups and a significant thrust on renewable energy reflect impetus towards much needed focus areas. Finally, through lowering its borrowings, the Government has made space for the private sector to step in and take over the baton on investment spending. Overall, a welcome part of the broader vision for a ‘Viksit’, Developed and Prosperous Bharat@ 100 by 2047.

Saji John, Research Analyst, Geojit Financial Services

Overall, the budget hails for economic development and narrows the fiscal deficit to 5.1 per cent in the next financial year. The government intends to let the private sector run with a capex growth of 11 per cent for the upcoming fiscal year while modernizing the rail network and port links to boost tourism, increase logistics efficiency, and reduce costs. The government has allotted Rs 8,500 crore and Rs 600 crore for solar and national green hydrogen, respectively, to emphasize the usage of renewable energy.

Harshad Patil, CIO, Tata AIA Life Insurance

The Finance Minister stayed firmly on the path of fiscal consolidation by delivering the FY 2024 fiscal deficit at 5.8 per cent and projecting the FY 2025 fiscal deficit at 5.1 per cent in the Union Budget. There were a slew of initiatives for solar energy, railways, EV ecosystem, defence and tourism among others. The Union budget has been welcomed by the bond markets for adhering to fiscal consolidation and the bond market expects the FY 2025 borrowings to be comfortably absorbed. Overall, the Union budget ensures the continuation of fiscal discipline and extension of time-tested policies which have boosted the Indian economy in recent years.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-ensures-continuation-of-fiscal-discipline-govts-intention-to-promote-growth-through-inclusive-policies-say-experts-3383909/
financialexpress.com,Interim Budget 2024: EV industry stakeholders share a sense of optimism,"The electric vehicle industry in India is seeing a new wave of stakeholders trying to do their bit to accelerate adoption of the green vehicles. The Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while did not explicitly mention any new policies for the EV segment in India, but stated the focus on EV charging ecosystem which will create new earning opportunities. Industry stakeholders share their perspective on the same.

Anant Nahata, CEO, Exicom Group: “The government’s push to enhance the EV ecosystem in the country is a positive move. This will expand and support the growth of manufacturing and charging infrastructure in India and in turn promote further growth of the EV ecosystem. The emphasis on e-buses underscores the government’s accent on enhancing public green mobility. This is in sync with India’s policy priority of gradual decarbonisation across sectors, ultimately leading to the 2070 vision of net-zero. For 2030, India aims to achieve that EVs account for at least 30 percent of new vehicles sales by 2030, under the EV30@30 campaign.”

Anupam Kumar, Founder & CEO, MiniMines Cleantech Solutions: “We commend the government’s visionary approach, particularly the emphasis on viability gap funding for tapping into shore-wind energy potential. This strategic initiative is a game-changer, poised to accelerate the widespread adoption of renewable energy across the country. We are highly optimistic about the future, especially with Bharat’s unwavering commitment to coal gasification and liquefaction, which is targeting a capacity of 100 metric tons by 2030. Moreover, the phased mandatory blending of compressed biogas in compressed natural gas for transport and piped natural gas for domestic purposes perfectly aligns with our steadfast dedication to sustainable practices. This forward-looking fosters the adoption of eco-friendly alternatives and propels the growth of businesses like ours.”



Arun Sreyas, Co-Founder, RACE Energy: “We appreciate the Interim Budget’s focus on supporting manufacturing and charging infrastructure and emphasising the importance of enhancing e-bus adoption by incorporating robust payment security options. However, as a battery swapping company heavily reliant on li-ion batteries, we were hopeful for GST parity on swappable batteries. A notable disparity exists in the rates between EVs sold with fixed batteries (taxed at 5%) and the li-ion batteries utilised for swapping purposes (taxed at 18% when sold separately). It is crucial to consider this need for the widespread adoption of EVs, and we’re hopeful this will be addressed in the Union Budget presented later this year.”

Avinash Sharma, Co-Founder & CEO, ElectricPe: “This year, we expected the strong growth of the EV sector to continue, with additional support from the government in terms of subsidies, incentives and policy across state and central. In her speech, FM Nirmala Sitharaman went over increases in support for EV infrastructure and manufacturing, which is positive for the industry. However, the changes to EV Charging GST, is still needed for the industry to experience unhampered growth. We are hopeful that further discussions will be had with regards to lowering GST for charging rates and standalone batteries, therefore growing EV affordability and adoption.”

Benjamin Lin, President, Delta Electronics India: “The Budget 2024 brings a significant boost to the future of mobility. The dedicated support for manufacturing and charging infrastructure is a game-changer, promising exponential growth in our industry. The encouragement for greater adoption of e-buses in public transport networks, coupled with the implementation of payment security mechanisms, not only propels environmental sustainability but also sparks innovation and economic prosperity. It also signifies a significant leap towards a greener and technologically advanced future for the entire industry.”

Kartikey Hariyani, Founder and CEO, ChargeZone: “We wholeheartedly support the Government’s vision outlined in the Interim Budget 2024, reflecting a strong commitment to the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem. The encouragement of e-buses in public transport networks, along with the implementation of a robust payment security mechanism not only accelerates the adoption of sustainable transportation, but also propels the growth of the EV charging sector.”

Nitin Gupta, Co-Founder & CEO, Attero: “The government’s focus on strengthening EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure in the interim budget is a positive signal towards sustainable mobility. With such initiatives, the government is laying a strong foundation for a greener and more resilient transportation sector. The push for e-buses adoption backed by a payment security mechanism will help in accelerating the transition to cleaner and more sustainable public transportation systems. The rooftop solarization scheme, enabling one crore households to receive up to 300 units of free electricity every month, marks a crucial step towards the adoption of renewable energy. This transition necessitates the use of lithium-ion battery packs for energy storage, indirectly promoting technological innovation and sustainability in the energy sector. Such initiatives align with global efforts to combat climate change and promote a greener, more sustainable future. While we hoped for provisions addressing the recycling of critical minerals, we are optimistic about the government’s overarching commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2070. It is a collective responsibility towards environmental stewardship and in building a greener future for generations to come.”

Pratik Kamdar, CEO & Co-Founder, Neuron Energy: “The Interim Budget focused on key sectors and one of the promising ones is EVs.

Nevertheless, we urge a closer examination of challenges such as high GST rates and the lack of affordable financing for critical EV infrastructure, including Battery-as-a-Service facilities and charging stations. Despite our hopes for FAME-III subsidies extending coverage to EV buyers opting for vehicles without batteries, this aspect was not addressed. We eagerly anticipate a more holistic strategy that considers the diverse needs of the entire EV ecosystem.”

Samarth Kholkar, CEO & Co-Founder, BLive: “We applaud the government’s forward-thinking approach in the budget announcement, particularly the emphasis on expanding the electric vehicle ecosystem. The commitment to support charging infrastructure and encourage the adoption of e-buses for public transport networks is a significant step towards a sustainable future. This move not only promotes cleaner and greener transportation but also boosts the growth of companies in the electric vehicle segment.

financialexpress.com,EV makers share their view on Interim Budget 2024,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented one of the shortest speeches while announcing Interim Budget 2024. But amongst the key highlights of her speech was the focus on electric vehicles. And this is what EV makers in India view it.

Atul Gupta, CEO, e-Sprinto: “Certainly, particulars in regard to the E-Mobility mission and encouragement of EV infrastructure were missing in the speech, however, the budget did point towards creating ambitious policies towards adoption of EVs in the public transportation sector.

This means that it will also see interest from financing companies and venture capitalists to accelerate growth. On February 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Interim Budget 2024, which was closely watched by everyone including stakeholders in the EV ecosystem. Here is what they think.

Anirudh A Damani, Director, Artha India Ventures: “In this year’s interim budget, the Finance Minister has adeptly spotlighted the government’s dedication to pivotal sectors poised to elevate GDP growth, with a particular focus on empowering youth, women, and micro-entrepreneurs. This commitment is further enriched by an ambitious agenda to enhance digital infrastructure, aiming to foster entrepreneurship nationwide and boost employment opportunities. Notably, the budget’s provisions for EV and deep tech sectors signal a continued allure for venture capital in startups, reinforcing investor confidence.

Our experience over the past decade affirms the high potential of these regions as the cradle for India’s next 100 unicorns, where access to early-stage capital has remained elusive. The government’s move to provide interest-free loans is a game-changer, not only facilitating capital accessibility but also encouraging deeper penetration by institutional investors in search of disruptive startups. This strategic intervention is poised to reshape India’s entrepreneurial landscape, heralding an era of widespread innovation and growth”.

Akash Gupta, Co-Founder & CEO, Zypp Electric: “We applaud the government’s commitment in the budget to nurturing the EV ecosystem.

The commitment to fortify the EV ecosystem and support manufacturing and charging infrastructure aligns with global environmental goals, positioning India as a leader in widespread sustainable mobility adoption. Continued focus on the rural economy support, youth skill development, and gender-inclusive initiatives reflects a holistic approach toward inclusive and sustainable growth. Skill India Mission’s success in training 1.4 crore youth strengthens the workforce for evolving job demands.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/business/express-mobility-ev-financing-companies-and-vc-share-their-views-on-interim-budget-2024-3383066/
financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Catalyst for real estate resurgence,"The recent Interim Budget for 2024 has sent ripples of optimism through the real estate sector, as industry leaders commend the government’s strategic focus on infrastructure development, affordable housing, and economic revitalization. The budget’s provisions, coupled with a cautiously optimistic outlook, have set the stage for potential transformation and growth in the real estate market. This article explores the insights shared by key figures in the industry, shedding light on the anticipated impact of the budget announcements.

The Interim Budget’s emphasis on infrastructure development and affordable housing emerges as a beacon of hope for the real estate market. Experts believe that initiatives aimed at enhancing urban infrastructure and improving connectivity will not only stimulate demand for both residential and commercial properties but also fuel economic growth in the long run. Furthermore, measures to ease liquidity constraints and encourage foreign investment are expected to attract much-needed capital inflows into the real estate sector. The budget, overall, paints a positive picture for the industry, offering a fertile ground for growth and expansion in the foreseeable future.

In a bid to empower women and bolster the middle-income segment, incentivizing women buyers is deemed a constructive step. This move not only increases women’s participation in the property market but also serves to uplift overall demand. Recognizing women as a significant force in the Indian economy, it becomes imperative to harness their potential judiciously. Additionally, a noteworthy proposal in the budget involves a reduction in rental income taxation, which currently stands at a seemingly deterrent rate of 30%. A lowered tax rate on rental income is anticipated to incentivize investments in the rental markets, playing a crucial role in addressing existing housing gaps, particularly in urban centers.





However, despite the positive strides reflected in the budget, the real estate sector remains cautiously optimistic about its impact. While applauding initiatives such as tax reforms and increased infrastructure investments, industry leaders stress the need for greater clarity on regulatory frameworks and the urgency to address liquidity constraints. Resolving these challenges is pivotal to unlocking the full potential of the real estate market and ensuring sustained long-term growth and stability.

The budget’s reaffirmation of a healthy economic growth trajectory, marked by improved tax receipts, the doubling of the GST tax base, and fiscal deficit revision, is hailed as a positive sign for the real estate sector. A robust economy is expected to prompt the government to introduce more supportive policies and incentives for mid-income housing, a commendable step towards addressing the housing needs of a wider demographic. The commitment to ongoing infrastructure development, including plans for additional airports, railway corridors, metro lines, and electric vehicle facilities, is viewed as a catalyst for higher realty demand, as these projects naturally translate into increased demand for real estate.

In conclusion, the Union Budget 2024 has emerged as a potential catalyst for the resurgence of the real estate sector. While the government’s focus on infrastructure, affordable housing, and economic revitalization is commendable, addressing regulatory frameworks and liquidity constraints will be pivotal in ensuring the sector’s sustained growth. The proposed incentives for women buyers and the potential reduction in rental income taxation signal a proactive approach to address specific challenges within the industry. As the real estate market cautiously embraces the positive momentum, the successful implementation of these budget measures is eagerly anticipated to pave the way for a thriving and dynamic real estate landscape in the years ahead.

financialexpress.com,Union Budget 2024: Propelling real estate growth through holistic development,"The Union Budget 2024, presented by Honourable Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, underscores the government’s commitment to comprehensive and inclusive development with a particular focus on infrastructure, youth empowerment, and support for the agriculture sector. These initiatives have the potential to generate positive impacts on the real estate industry, fostering growth and creating better opportunities in the medium and long term.

1. Infrastructure Development:

The government’s emphasis on building various forms of infrastructure, including digital, social, and physical, at a record pace sets the stage for increased demand in the real estate sector. As connectivity and accessibility improve, the value of properties in well-connected regions is likely to see an upward trend, making strategic investments in these areas promising for real estate stakeholders.

2. Youth Empowerment:

Recognizing that prosperity hinges on equipping and empowering the youth, the budget’s focus on skill development and higher education can fuel the demand for student housing and affordable accommodations near educational institutions. Real estate developers should consider investing in areas with a burgeoning student population, ensuring sustainable returns in the long run.





3. Agri Initiatives:

The mention of initiatives such as the PM KISAN Yojana and Fasal Bima Yojana highlights the government’s commitment to supporting farmers. It can have a cascading effect on rural and peri-urban real estate markets, as increased income for farmers may lead to heightened demand for residential properties and ancillary services in these regions.

4. Digital Transformation:

The Budget’s acknowledgement of the positive transformation in the Indian economy, particularly in the last decade, aligns with the ongoing digital revolution. The rise of remote work and digital businesses may influence real estate preferences, with a potential surge in demand for flexible workspaces and residential properties in well-connected suburban areas.

5. Inclusive Development:

The Budget’s focus on ‘Garib, Mahilayen, Yuva, and Annadata’ emphasizes inclusivity. Real estate developers should consider projects that cater to the housing needs of diverse segments, including affordable housing for economically weaker sections, empowering women-centric initiatives, and creating youth-centric spaces. Initiatives aim to reduce the gender gap in the society.

6. Skill India Mission:

The substantial investments in skill development and the establishment of educational institutions contribute to a skilled workforce. This can attract businesses and industries to set up operations, thereby creating demand for commercial and residential real estate in proximity to these educational hubs.

7. Boost to Tourism:

The Budget’s recognition of the positive transformation in the last decade extends to the tourism sector, presenting a significant opportunity for real estate growth. With a focus on developing all-round, all-pervasive, and all-inclusive infrastructure, popular tourist destinations like Lakshadweep could witness increased demand for hospitality and accommodation facilities. Real estate developers may explore investments in regions poised for tourism-driven growth, anticipating a surge in demand for resorts, hotels, and vacation homes.

8. Spiritual Tourism and Ayodhya:

The government’s emphasis on holistic development aligns with the promotion of spiritual tourism, evident in the mention of Ayodhya. The ongoing and upcoming developments in Ayodhya, including the Ram Mandir and associated projects, create a unique opportunity for real estate investments. The city’s rising prominence as a spiritual and cultural hub could lead to heightened demand for residential and commercial properties. Real estate experts should consider Ayodhya as a potential growth centre and strategize developments catering to the influx of tourists and pilgrims.

In Summary:

The Union Budget 2024 lays a solid foundation for holistic development, presenting numerous opportunities for the real estate industry. By aligning strategies, real estate experts can position themselves to reap the benefits of evolving market dynamics and contribute to the nation’s growth story. It’s imperative for stakeholders to stay agile, adapt to changing trends, and capitalize on the potential opportunities arising from the government’s progressive fiscal policies.

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 to enhance livability index, promote homeownership","The Interim Budget 2024, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, reflects a strong commitment to infrastructure development and overall economic growth of India. The substantial increase in capital spending by 11%, reaching 3.4% of GDP, and a record outlay for infrastructure, including the construction of three major railway corridors, establish a solid foundation for unprecedented development in the foreseeable five years.

“This augmented financial allocation, combined with the elevated outlay of Rs 11.11 lakh crores specifically earmarked for infrastructure in FY25, signals a determined stride towards unparalleled infrastructural growth. Furthermore, this financial commitment paves the way for achieving our national goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047,” said Sanjay Sharma, Chief Financial Officer, Tata Projects Ltd.

However, given its interim nature, the budget offered only a few announcements that impact real estate.



“Still, its commitment on advancing the ‘housing for all’ vision stands out with provisions under the PM Awas Yojana and a focus to enhance economic, digital and social infrastructure. These strategic initiatives are poised to generate additional employment opportunities and foster a positive ripple effect on the real estate sector. From a supply perspective, tax breaks such as a reduction in custom duties or GST would have been beneficial in accelerating new supply. In the current landscape where demand has surged to a decadal high along with a substantial increase in residential prices, such measures could have played a role in creating a balance and crafting a sustainable long term growth story,” said Sudhir Pai, CEO, Magicbricks.



Yashank Wason, Managing Director, Royal Green Realty, said, “As expected, there was no direct benefit announced to the real estate developers or measures that can increase the buyer activity. However, the Budget reflects the government’s focus on infrastructure which will ensure expansion of real estate scope in newer areas. The positivity shown by the finance minister in economic growth and the acceptance that salaries have increased by 50% in the last ten years instils confidence in the sector that caters to the most basic need of people. We must also wait for the details of the Housing for Middle Class that the FM has announced. For office real estate, the announcement of extending tax benefits to startups may increase activity.”

Overall, the interim budget centers around infrastructure development across various sectors, aiming to enhance the livability index and assist in promoting homeownership.

Amar Sarin, CEO & MD, TARC Ltd, said, “The Union Budget 2024 exemplifies a visionary approach towards accelerating inclusive development and economic resilience. It astutely addresses the pivotal sectors of infrastructure, real estate, and urban development. The government’s commitment to augmenting metro connectivity, supporting electric vehicle manufacturing, and enhancing housing for the middle class subtly aligns with our mission to contribute to a robust and sustainable urban landscape.We see this as an opportune moment to redefine luxury living, leveraging the government’s focus on incentivizing green initiatives and infrastructure development. The budget’s emphasis on economic sustainability and technological advancements, backed by a projected fiscal deficit target of 5.1% of GDP for FY25, is set to further elevate the ultra-luxury real estate market, aligning perfectly with our commitment to crafting exceptional living spaces.”

LC Mittal, Director, Motia Group, said, “The union budget reiterates a healthy economic growth marked by improved tax receipt, doubling of GST tax base, revision of fiscal deficit, etc. A healthy economy will augur well for real estate. GOI will come up with better policies and incentives to support mid-income housing, which is a commendable step. Another factor to look into is the constant growth in infrastructure through constructive steps. GOI has announced plans to build more airports, railway corridors, metro lines, EV facilities, etc. This will naturally translate into higher realty demand.”

In the middle income segment, incentivizing the women buyers can be a constructive step.

“This will increase the participation of women in the property market while also uplifting the overall demand. Women are now an important force in the Indian economy, as it is essential to leverage their potential judiciously. Another prudent step is to reduce the rental income taxation. In India, the rental income is taxed at 30%, which is seemingly high and is touted as a deterrent. A lowered rate will incentivize investments in the rental markets and can be instrumental in bridging the existing housing gaps, especially in urban centers,” said Anurag Goel, Director, Goel Ganga Developments.

Ananta Singh Raghuvanshi, President, NAREDCO Mahi, said, “Benefits for women and first home buyers of a substantial nature will work as a catalyst in mid segment. Home buyers will be encouraged and rental income taxation will be reduced.”

Under the PM Gati Shakti Plan, 75000 crores have been invested in 2023-24 across 100 critical projects.

“The master plan is integral to India’s aim to build an inclusive, integrated, and comprehensive economy. Through systematic investments and capacity building it will improve productivity and enhance the overall business climate. The mega plan will be an absolute game changer for tier 2 and 3 cities in India through accelerated last mile connectivity, mass mobility, green growth, and financial investments. Naturally this will translate into increased demand for housing, commercial projects, warehouses, industrial parks, townships, etc,” said Gurmit Singh Arora, National President, Indian Plumbing Association.

Aman Gupta, Director, RPS Group, said, “PM Gatishakti project can bring a windfall for real estate markets in tier 2 and 3 cities in India. The multimodal logistic projects will comprise building new airports, mass transit systems, railway corridors, roadways, waterways, etc. It will create a framework for a more inclusive, integrated, multi-phased growth in India. This will act as an economic growth multiplier with increased capacity development, employment creation, and investment inflow. Naturally this will push ahead real estate demand.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/budget-2024-to-enhance-livability-index-promote-homeownership-3382799/
financialexpress.com,Interim Budget 2024: Growth and welfare with fiscal rectitude,"By Ashish kumar Chauhan,

The interim Budget for the financial year 2024-25 is a comprehensive plan aimed at fostering economic growth while exercising fiscal restraint. The Budget points to four major ‘castes’ — the poor, the farmers, the women and the youth of the country — and correctly considers their needs and welfare as the highest priority.

It is set against the backdrop of a global economy struggling with inflation, high interest rates, low growth, and high public debt. India has successfully navigated these challenges, showing resilience in the face of crises related to food, fertiliser & fuel, and has put forth solutions for global problems.



The Budget also demonstrates the government’s focus on fiscal consolidation, with a reduction in the fiscal deficit to 5.8% for FY24 versus a budgeted 5.9%, a further reduction to 5.1% for FY25 and aims to reach a target of below 4.5% by FY26. This is a significant move given that the nominal growth for the current year stands at 9% versus the Budget estimate of 10%.

Capital expenditure is notably high, with an increase of 16.9% to a record Rs 11.11 trillion, accounting for 3.4% of the GDP. This is the highest in 26 years and implies a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27% over the last five years in capex, which now comprises 23.3% of total expenditure, indicating the government’s commitment to enhancing public infrastructure.

The Budget maintains policy continuity in areas like housing and infrastructure ensuring a stable environment for investment and growth. Over 30 million houses have been made under the PM AWAS Yojana, with a plan to add a further 20 million over the next five years. This is part of a larger vision for empowerment over entitlement, shifting the focus from mere poverty alleviation to enabling participation in the development process.

Beyond housing, there is a clear focus on improving logistics, reducing costs, all with a clear intent on ‘Atmanirbharta’ or self-reliance. For instance, the Vande Bharat trains exemplify the high-speed connectivity initiatives that promise efficiency at a lower cost due to its indigenous build. Through the aim of involving households in the energy transition process, the Budget proposes to exploit India’s high insolation levels to boost solar energy production.

On the external front, India’s growth trajectory and unique positioning has contributed to the inflow of nearly $600 billion in foreign direct investment over the past decade, signalling investor confidence in India’s economic stability and growth potential. The market performance has been a testament to this, with the Nifty50 Index growing by 257% and generating a CAGR of 14% in the last decade.

India’s growth trajectory has historically been services-led, with hopes now pinned on manufacturing due to schemes like the production-linked incentive (PLI). In this context, the Budget reiterates the government’s commitment to research and development (R&D) and innovation, as encapsulated in “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, and Jai Anusandhan”.

Beyond FDI and services, there is also a noted increase in remittances, indicating a shift from low to high-paying jobs and a richer engagement of the diaspora in the country’s economy.

While there were no tax changes in an interim Budget, the tax regime has now been refined over the years, with both direct and indirect taxes rationalised to provide certainty for future investments, particularly to foreign investors. The results are there to see — the direct tax/GDP ratio at 6.6% is the highest since the 1980s. In conclusion, the Indian Union Budget represents a continuation of the PM’s strategic vision for the nation’s growth, emphasizing infrastructure development, fiscal consolidation, and social empowerment.

It aims to ensure economic stability and growth while providing a welfare umbrella for the Indian population, a must-have for any developed nation today. The Budget builds on the foundation for the country to navigate the complexities of the global economic landscape during our country’s ‘Kartavyakaal’ in the coming years and achieve a ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047.

financialexpress.com,Interim Budget 2024: When will the Union Budget be presented this year?,"Today Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting an interim budget at 11 am instead of a union budget. Last, an interim budget was presented by Piyush Goyal in 2019.

What is an Interim Budget?

There is no Constitutional Provision to present the Interim Budget. An outgoing government presents the Interim Budget before the Lok Sabha polls during the Budget session. Subsequently, following victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the new government unveils the Union Budget. The interim budget provides financial details for the transitional period. It is crucial to note that no major policies, that can burden the next government, can be announced in an Interim Budget.



When will the Union Budget be presented?

During an election year, the incumbent government cannot present a full budget. This year India will be holding its Lok Sabha Elections following which a new government will take charge. Once that government is formed, the Union Budget will be presented. The comprehensive annual budget functions as a strategic roadmap, delineating the economic trajectory for the entire fiscal year.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/interim-budget-2024-when-will-the-union-budget-be-presented-this-year-3380690/
financialexpress.com,"Interim Budget 2024: At 58 minutes, Nirmala Sitharaman delivers shortest Budget speech since 2019","Interim Budget 2024 Latest News: Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman delivered her shortest budget speech since 2019 on Thursday. Presenting the final Budget of Modi govt ahead of the Lok Sabha Elections 2024, Sitharaman spoke for 58 minutes, shy of an hour today. This is her shortest budget speech in the last six years that she has presented the Union budget as the finance minister of the country. Back in 2019, she addressed Parliament for two hours 15 minutes during her maiden budget speech. In 2020, Sitharaman’s Budget speech was the longest with a duration of two hours 42 minutes.



In 2021, the duration of Sitharaman’s Budget speech was one hour 50 minutes. In 2022, it was 1 hour 30 minutes, last year, it was 1 hour 27 minutes. The Thursday’s Budget presentation focused more on India’s journey in last 10 years. In terms of announcements, there were not many significant declarations.

Interim Budget 2024: Key takeaways

The interim budget for 2024/25 is seen as the economic manifesto of Modi government, offering insights into its strategies for fiscal consolidation, borrowings, and future taxation policies. On Thursday, Sitharaman announced India’s goal to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.1% in the fiscal year 2024/25, following a decrease to 5.8% of the gross domestic product in the current year.



Sitharaman emphasised the Centre’s commitment to fiscal consolidation while presenting the interim budget for the fiscal year commencing on April 1. Achieving a lower fiscal deficit target of 5.1% of GDP, coupled with increased capital spending and the implementation of new welfare policies, will rely on augmented tax collections and certain subsidy reductions.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/interim-budget-2024-at-58-minutes-nirmala-sitharaman-delivers-shortest-budget-speech-since-2019-bkg-3381385/

She is now on her way to the Parliament to present the Interim Budget 2024 in just a few moments.

No one can say with a 100% surety what announcements the Finance Minister has kept wrapped in red. A lot of secrecy surrounds the budget. And while it’s strictly confidential, one time in 1950, a portion of the Union Budget was leaked.

1950 Union Budget leak



Back in 1950, the printing of the budget used to be printed at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. That’s when a portion of the budget was leaked. Post this leak, the printing venue was shifted to a government press on Minto Road.

However, in 1980, a government press was set up in the basement of the North Block.

Interim Budget need

The Constitution does not have any provision for an Interim Budget presentation. Typically, an outgoing government presents the Interim Budget before Lok Sabha polls during the Budget session. Also known as a vote-on-account, the Interim Budget acts as a temporary financial plan, supporting the central government’s expenses until elections conclude and a new central government takes charge .Issued by the outgoing government, this budget is designed to guarantee the seamless continuation of vital government functions and services until the next administration assumes responsibility. The Interim Budget offers financial details for the transitional period.

financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: FISME seeks reforms to increase access to finance for MSMEs, highlighting alleged anti-competitive practices by banks","MSME body Federation of Indian Micro and Small & Medium Enterprises (FISME) has requested Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Budget 2024 for reforms to increase access to finance for small businesses, highlighting the alleged anti-competitive practices by banks and unease in banking for MSMEs.

According to FISME, lack of competition in the banking sector (with 75 per cent of banks being in the public sector) and weak regulatory institutions, which have not been very successful in ensuring customer-centeredness of banks and near defunct grievance redressal mechanism (Office of Banking Ombudsman) coalesce into an unhappy experience for an ordinary MSME owner with banks.

For instance, foreclosure charges are levied by banks on prepayment of bank loans or when the borrower wants to change the bank due to unsatisfactory services. According to FISME, the charges range from around 2-4 per cent and are used as a coercive tool to force an MSME to stay put.



“What is disturbing is that such practices are in violation of RBI facilitated Code for MSEs that all Scheduled Commercial Banks are signatory which advises them that Micro and Small Enterprises be spared of such penalties. Except for ICICI Bank, no bank has announced an unambiguous policy for not charging foreclosure/ prepayment charges in spite of signing on the Code for MSEs,” the association said in a note ahead of the budget.

In addition to the foreclosure charges, FISME said many commercial banks levy non-compliance charges when an MSME borrower insists on changing bank. “RBI and Ministry of Finance need to be persuaded to put an end to these exploitative practices.”

FISME also noted that the Ombudsman scheme by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has failed to provide justice to hapless MSME borrowers and is seen siding with the bank rather than the customer.

“One of the most important lacunas in the scheme is that it is not mandatory for Ombudsman to deliver reasoned/speaking orders because of which most cases are just dismissed or decided arbitrarily without giving reasons,” it added.

The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme was launched in November 2021 to improve the grievance redress mechanism for customer complaints against entities regulated by RBI with one portal, one email and one address for the customers to lodge their complaints.

Another concern highlighted by FISME was related to Bank Loan Rating (BLR) wherein if the exposure of a bank to an MSME is beyond a threshold, the former insists on getting BLR which is a third-party rating from RBI or SEBI-approved rating agencies.

FISME said the RBI had clarified that BLR was an advisory for banks and not mandatory till their own risk assessment models would be ready. However, “the trouble is that historically these rating agencies were brought in to rate the listed companies for Return on Investment (ROI) and assign A,B,C type of ratings to inform retail investor. The same agencies were suddenly mandated to rate MSMEs for short-term ‘Solvency’ with the same set of formats. The results have been disastrous.”

As a result, MSMEs have not been able to get the investment grade rating which meant higher interest rates and demand for additional collateral security. To rub the salt in the wound, the practices of the rating agencies are monopolistic and rapacious, said FISME.

“It’s time the BLR ratings are junked. They have not helped either the lenders or the banks. Further, almost all MSMEs feel exploited by rating agencies.”

FISME also called for reforms around bank guarantees or performance guarantees sought from MSMEs participating in public procurement. For this, banks charge huge sums against service from MSMEs (margin money, collateral and service charges for period of use) unlike large companies for whom banks offer guarantees at a nominal price, it said.

While the Finance Minister announced the option of replacing bank guarantees with insurance surety from insurance companies in the union budget in 2022 which neither insists on margin money nor demands collateral security but charge for usance period, the option of replacing the guarantees with insurance surety is restricted to NHAI projects only.

“It needs to be extended to MSMEs. One can imagine the magnitude of the problem that on GeM portal alone there are over 8.5 lac MSMEs registered all of whom suffer from the inefficient and outdated bank guarantee/performance guarantee regime,” said FISME.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Top reactions from healthcare industry leaders–Who said what on Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcements,"Budget 2024: Finance Minister Sitharaman tabled the interim budget 2024 ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. During her budget speech, Sitharaman announced that healthcare cover under the Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme will be extended to all ASHA and anganwadi workers and helpers.

Sitharaman also announced that the government will encourage vaccination for girls in the 9-14 year age group for the prevention of cervical cancer. The Health Ministry has been allocated Rs 90,658.63 crore in the interim Budget for 2024-2025.

Out of Rs 90,658.63 crore, Rs 87,656.90 crore has been allocated to the Department of Health and Family Welfare while Rs 3001.73 crore to the Department of Health Research. The Budget allocation for the AYUSH ministry has been hiked from Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 3,712.49 crore, recording a 23.74 per cent increase.



Here are some top reactions from key industry leaders:

Dr Garima Sawhney, Co-founder, Pristyn Care: “In the interim budget presented today, the government mentioned that empowerment of women through entrepreneurship, ease of living and dignity has gained momentum in last 10 years. The Finance Minister has allocated 30 crore MUDRA Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. This is going to elevate women entrepreneurship and boost startup ecosystem that will definitely make the Indian economy reach greater heights. The government’s announcements on various schemes for maternal and child healthcare under one comprehensive programme and upgradation of Anganwadi centres under Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 will expedite improved nutrition delivery, early childhood care and development. This is a great move by the government as this is going to boost women and child healthcare. The health and well-being of women and children are critical in the economic development of the nation and prioritising social sector spending on women and young people’s health is central to all our futures.”

Dr. Azad Moopen, Founder and Chairman – Aster DM Healthcare: “It is heartening to see that the Interim Union Budget focuses on the upliftment of the masses through specific focus on the poor, farmers, youth and women. The allocation of Rs. 1-lakh crore with 50-year interest free loans will encourage the start-up culture that India is now thriving upon, encouraging the youth of today to become entrepreneurs and focus on their growth as well growth of the nation. In healthcare we were hoping to see an increase in the GDP allocation of minimum 5% for the sector, hopefully this will be addressed in the complete Budget to be announced in July this year, under the new government. We are glad that the government is considering to add more hospitals in all districts in the country, which is essential to meet the rising demand. We would recommend focusing on public-private partnerships (PPP) to address this. With all maternal and child healthcare to be brought under one- scheme, this will be essential. It is promising to hear that government plans to open more medical colleges alongside existing hospital infrastructure. There is now an urgent need for comprehensive reform of medical education, to ensure that the medical professionals of tomorrow are trained in the latest medicine and techniques, like their western counterparts. The strong impetus on immunisation of children under Mission Indradhanush and young girls for cervical cancer will go a long way in strengthening preventive care measures in the country and reduce the burden from communicable and non-communicable diseases.”

Dr. Charit Bhograj, CEO and Founder of Tricog Health: “Interim Budget 2024 presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman promises a boost for healthcare in India. The proposed measures include broadening health insurance coverage, reinforcing immunization efforts, investing in maternal and child health, and prioritizing rural healthcare. These initiatives will enhance medical service accessibility in vulnerable regions. The budget reflects a commitment to inclusivity, accessibility, and establishing a robust healthcare foundation for all citizens, signaling a significant move toward strengthening the healthcare infrastructure in the country.”

Jyotsna Govil, Chairperson- Indian Cancer Society, Delhi Branch: “We are quite happy to see from the budget that our Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman has increased the allocation for health, as compared with last year. However, we wish it had been much more, particularly the allocation to cancer. We have a young population who need education about cancer and about how lifestyle impacts it, and it is very important that the budget allocates funds towards awareness and prevention. With increased awareness, the numbers for treatment will automatically come down and create an economic benefit both to the person and the nation.”

Vaibhav Tewari, CEO & Co-Founder, Portea Medical: “While we recognize the positive advancements in the healthcare sector in the Budget, certain aspects warrant a “wait-and-watch” approach. The decision to form a committee for expanding medical colleges recognizes the need for enhanced healthcare infrastructure. However, swift and effective resolution of execution challenges is imperative for the initiative’s success. The emphasis on immunization (cervical cancer vaccination) for girls and the integration of healthcare schemes for mother and child into a unified format signals a commitment to preventive and comprehensive healthcare. Yet, success hinges on seamlessly integrating existing programs, clear execution strategies, and robust monitoring mechanisms. Expanding Ayushman Bharat health insurance to ASHA, Aanganwadi workers, and helpers supports the frontline healthcare workforce. Efficacy will depend on seamless collaboration between public and private sectors, coupled with the necessary digital infrastructure. There were several other key expectations that have remained unaddressed such as expansion of insurance coverage to outside of hospital care, funding, support for tech-driven healthcare sector, and healthcare startups etc. Since this is an interim budget, it seems that barring some of the operational needs, major policy initiatives have been left out for the full annual Budget that will be presented after the elections this year. Looking ahead, fostering a collaborative environment is crucial for the government, leveraging strengths from both public and private entities. A digitally-driven approach, emphasizing transparency and efficiency, is pivotal for executing these healthcare initiatives successfully. At Portea, we are eager to actively contribute to these efforts, leveraging our expertise to ensure a robust and accessible healthcare system for all.”

Nilesh Aggarwal, CEO, IJCP Group & Founder, Medtalks: “The Union Ministry’s Budget 2024 underscores critical aspects of healthcare that demand urgent attention. One of the paramount needs is the shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly doctors. The commitment to establishing new medical colleges not only addresses this pressing need but also signifies a proactive step towards bolstering our healthcare workforce. With an ever-growing population and escalating healthcare demands, the expansion of medical education is crucial for ensuring adequate healthcare access across the nation. Furthermore, the inclusion of cervical cancer prevention through vaccination for young girls is commendable. It emphasizes the importance of preventive healthcare measures in addressing significant public health concerns. However, beyond disease prevention, there’s a compelling need for universal healthcare coverage. Access to quality healthcare should be a fundamental right for every individual, irrespective of socio-economic status. Achieving universal healthcare coverage requires concerted efforts from both public and private sectors, alongside policy interventions aimed at bridging healthcare disparities. Additionally, increased medical education should not solely focus on producing more doctors but should also prioritize holistic healthcare delivery. Public awareness campaigns on lifestyle issues play a pivotal role in promoting preventive healthcare practices. Educating the public about healthy lifestyle choices, disease prevention, and early intervention can significantly reduce the burden on healthcare systems and improve overall well-being. In this endeavor, companies like the IJCP Group and MedTalks play a crucial role. With our large database of healthcare professionals and consumers, we can disseminate valuable information to the masses, facilitating greater awareness and understanding of healthcare issues. By leveraging technology and outreach efforts, we can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their health and well-being, ultimately contributing to a healthier society.”

Jasdeep Singh, Group CEO, CARE Hospitals Group: “The 2024 Union Budget places a pivotal emphasis on enhancing healthcare services, particularly in tier II cities and rural areas. Aligned with the overarching theme of women empowerment, the budget addresses the healthcare sector comprehensively. A noteworthy initiative is the improvement and fortification of the rural healthcare system, a move that stands to benefit women and children significantly. The extension of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana to include all ASHA and Anganwadi workers ensures that healthcare becomes accessible and affordable for all. Cervical cancer, a prevalent health concern, is addressed through the introduction of vaccination for girls aged 9-14, a pivotal step in preventing the disease and raising awareness. The consolidation of maternal and child healthcare schemes into a comprehensive program aims to empower the vulnerable groups, especially women and children. The government’s commitment to setting up more medical colleges, utilizing existing hospital infrastructure, reflects a strategic approach to strengthening the healthcare system. The ‘U-Win’ platform for managing immunization, along with the intensification of Mission Indradhanush, will be rapidly implemented across the country. The government’s multifaceted approach in this budget underscores a dedication to quality healthcare, particularly in tier II cities and rural regions. We are glad that we are aligned with the Government’s plans as we will continue to focus on tier II cities and rural areas to cater quality healthcare efficiently.”

Ankur Gigras, CEO and Co-founder, HexaHealth: “The interim budget was just released, and the emphasis on a comprehensive GDP, incorporating governance, development, and performance was evident. The proposed fiscal estimate reinforces a people-centric agenda and promises great enhancement in Indian healthcare. As per WHO, cervical cancer ranks as the fourth most prevalent cancer among women, posing a significant challenge for the Indian population. The budget forecast has thus put focus on prioritising precautionary healthcare by encouraging vaccination in girls of 9-14 years for cervical cancer. This initiative is a great step to help in the diagnosis and prevention of cervical cancer in girls at an early age. Additionally, the finance minister mentioned extending the Ayushman Bharat scheme to include ASHA and Anganwadi workers, which reflects inclusivity by recognising their invaluable role in our health system. The finance minister expressed her futuristic expectations during the provisional budget, ensuring the necessary support. The vision for 2047 is full of commitment to providing abundant opportunities for our country. It has motivated the healthcare sector to continue contributing to holistic development and achieve great heights.”

Dheeraj Jain, Founder, Redcliffe Labs: “In the fabric of India’s healthcare, the interim budget announcement 2024 by FM Sitaraman unveils a tapestry of hope, especially with its strides towards addressing cervical cancer, the silent predator claiming thousands of lives annually. With cervical cancer ranking as the nation’s second leading cancer, the allocation for a vaccination drive targeting girls aged 9 to 14 echoes the urgency of the hour. It’s a beacon of progress, resonating deeply with Redcliffe Labs’ ‘Be Your Own Sheroes’ campaign launched in January 2024, which tirelessly advocates for timely diagnosis and vaccinations as it can significantly help prevent, cure, and treat cervical cancer. The significance of this budget extends beyond mere numbers, for it promises to fortify our hospitals’ infrastructure and streamline schemes dedicated to children and maternal health. It’s not merely a fiscal plan; it’s a blueprint for a paradigm shift toward a Healthier Bharat. As we chart this course, I am reminded of the countless lives we can save and the futures we can safeguard. In the essence of simplicity yet profound impact, the budget’s narrative speaks directly to the hearts of every Indian. It embodies a call to action, a testament to our collective resolve to rewrite the healthcare narrative in India. Specifically, the steps taken towards empowering women’s health are essential for the overall well-being of women and the thriving future of the country. Together, through awareness, advocacy, and unwavering commitment, we can make quality healthcare accessible for all. This is not just a budget; it’s a pledge—a pledge to build a healthier, more resilient India for generations to come.” – Dheeraj Jain, Founder CEO, Redcliffe Labs.”

Dr. Sujit Paul, Group CEO at Zota Healthcare Ltd: “The government is committed to prioritizing the health and well-being of our nation. The initiation of a robust campaign to vaccinate girls aged 9-14 against cervical cancer is commendable. Ayushman Bharat now extends its coverage to include ASHA and Anganwadi workers. To strengthen medical education, it will establish more colleges using existing hospital infrastructure, guided by a dedicated committee. Unifying maternal and child healthcare schemes will ensure effective implementation, while ‘Saksham Anganwadi’ and Poshan 2.0 upgrades aim to enhance nutrition and early childhood care. The ‘U-Win’ platform and intensified Mission Indradhanush will swiftly cover the entire country.”

Dr.Vigyan mishra, Chief of Lab-Neuberg Diagnostics, Noida: “Cervical cancer vaccines, such as HPV vaccines, play a crucial role in preventing the onset of this potentially life-threatening disease. By targeting the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a leading cause of cervical cancer, these vaccines empower individuals to safeguard their health. Regular vaccination is a proactive step in reducing the risk of cervical cancer, emphasizing the importance of preventive healthcare. Through widespread vaccination efforts, we can contribute to a future where cervical cancer becomes a preventable condition, enhancing overall public health. In India, you currently have two main options for cervical cancer vaccines:

Internationally available vaccines:

Cervarix (bivalent): This vaccine protects against two high-risk HPV types (16 and 18), responsible for around 70% of cervical cancers. It’s typically recommended for females aged 9-14 years in a two-dose schedule.

Gardasil (quadrivalent): This vaccine covers four HPV types (16, 18, 6, and 11). The additional types offer protection against genital warts. Gardasil is recommended for females aged 9-26 years and can be given in a two-dose or three-dose schedule depending on age.

India-made vaccine:

Cervavac (quadrivalent): This is India’s first indigenous HPV vaccine, launched in January 2023. It targets the same four HPV types as Gardasil. Cervavac is currently undergoing evaluation for inclusion in the national immunization program and is expected to be more affordable than the international options.

D. S. Negi, CEO, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre (RGCIRC): “We welcome the interim budget announcement pertaining to the health sector. Initiatives like the establishment of a committee to create additional medical colleges by leveraging existing hospital infrastructure under various departments, promoting vaccination of girls aged 9-14 to prevent cervical cancer, and expanding the Ayushman Bharat scheme to all ASHA workers, Anganwadi Workers, and Helpers are steps in the right direction. These measures will certainly put together will help address key issues of shortage of health workers, increase access to quality healthcare, and prevention of life-threatening diseases. However, we hope the government will prioritize other pressing issues in the healthcare sector and provide budgetary incentives in the upcoming full budget.”

Joseph Pasangha, Group COO, SPARSH Group of Hospitals, Bangalore: “The government’s commitment to implementing economic policies that facilitate high-quality and affordable medical care for all is crucial for fostering investments in healthcare. The inclusion of cervical cancer vaccination for girls under 15 in the Universal Immunization Programme would be highly advantageous if actioned. Efforts to address Foot & Mouth disease and the consolidation of various schemes into a comprehensive program for maternal and child healthcare will enhance synergy, leading to improved implementation. However, we anticipate a comprehensive allocation, specifically designated for healthcare in the upcoming July budget. This allocation should concentrate on establishing efficient processes for selecting, implementing, and monitoring Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to meet the current need. Well-defined guidelines and a cooperative approach between public and private entities are essential for nurturing successful partnerships capable of addressing critical healthcare needs nationwide.”

Deepak Sahni, Founder of Healthians: “At Healthians, we applaud the government’s visionary strides in the 2024-25 budget, notably prioritizing cervical cancer vaccination for young girls and integrating maternal and child care schemes under the U-WIN platform. The emphasis on comprehensive healthcare aligns seamlessly with our mission. The extension of Ayushman Bharat cover to Anganwadi and Asha workers underscores their invaluable role in grassroots health. As proud contributors to India’s health landscape, we stand committed to realizing a healthier and more resilient nation in harmony with these progressive initiatives.”

Dr.Shafiq AM, Co-Founder and CEO, Trilife Hospital: “The healthcare sector in the country is facing a dearth of skilled experts and the setting up of a committee for skill development announced by the Hon Finance Minister in the interim budget is a welcome step to bridge this gap. The Interim budget has also addressed the urgent requirement for healthcare infrastructure by announcing the setting up of a committee to examine healthcare infrastructure issues to consider the use of existing medical infrastructure under various departments. The focus to plan free vaccinations for cervical cancer in girls between nine and fourteen years of age is also a welcome move. Every year in India about 1,20,000 women are diagnosed with Cervical cancer and about 67,000 women die from the disease every year. We are hopeful that the full budget later in the year will support innovation and R&D and rationalise the GST Framework and tax incentives for private sector participation in healthcare infrastructure development.”

Partha Pratim Das Mahapatra, Founder and CEO, EzeRx: “The Interim Budget of 2024 marks a significant boon for the healthcare industry, particularly benefiting the rural areas where the need is greatest. The government’s strategic initiatives, notably Mission Indradhanush, exemplify a transformative commitment to immunize against measles, polio, hepatitis B, tetanus, diphtheria, TB, and pertussis, empowering women and securing a brighter future for children. The visionary establishment of additional medical colleges resonates well with our youthful nation, addressing the aspirations of many prospective doctors who currently seek education abroad. This strategic move not only empowers the youth but also contributes to the radiant future of India. A powerful step forward involves extending cervical cancer vaccination to adolescents aged 9-14, a crucial move in combatting a significant healthcare challenge. This visionary approach aims to tackle cervical cancer effectively. The government’s focus on child and maternal health through the implementation of a comprehensive childcare plan, as part of the POSHAN 2.0 scheme, is commendable. The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, collectively referred to as Poshan 2.0, constitute an Integrated Nutrition Support Programme targeting malnutrition among children, adolescent girls, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. While lauding the positive strides in the Interim Budget of 2024, anticipation builds for the forthcoming Union Budget, expected to further catalyze the nation’s growth. We express gratitude to the government for its proactive measures in the preventive healthcare domain. Additionally, we anticipate informative insights shedding light on the non-invasive device genre.”

Behram Khodaiji, CEO of Ruby Hall Clinic on the Interim Budget: “The decision to provide free HPV vaccines for girls between 9-14 years in the budget is a critical step in promoting the health and well-being of young girls in our community. By making these vaccines more accessible, we are taking a proactive approach to preventing HPV-related health issues in the future. This decision not only benefits the individuals receiving the vaccine but also serves to protect the broader population from the spread of HPV. Investing in the health of our young girls is an investment in the future of our society, as the budget focuses on poor, women and youth who are the pillars of our country.”

Dr. Narendra Vankar, Founder and CEO, Quantum CorpHealth: “This fiscal year’s interim budget, which covers a wide range of areas and lays out specific actions to be carried out, is a demonstration of the government’s progressive thinking. We applaud the government’s dedication to bolstering the healthcare industry, with a particular emphasis on building a strong system for today’s contemporary India. It is very appreciated that girls between the ages of 9 and 14 will now receive cervical cancer vaccinations in schools, as stated by Hon. Finance Minister Nirmala Seetharaman. By focusing on nutrition delivery as a component of early childhood care and development, Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 will contribute to the creation of a healthy community. With the kind of components being combined to make health the most reliable foundation of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the Indian government is providing strong assistance to the healthcare industry. We anticipate some more encouraging announcements with the planned outline in the coming months, which will help the industry grow even more and thrive in a more improved manner.”

Ashish Singhal, CFO & Company Secretary of CORE Diagnostics Pvt Ltd, Gurgaon: “I am optimistic about the Union Budget 2024-25. The emphasis on infrastructure financing, incentivizing R&D, and regulatory policies for health startups aligns with our vision at CORE Diagnostics. We believe that these measures will foster innovation, enhance accessibility, and ultimately improve patient outcomes in the healthcare sector. We look forward to seeing the positive impact of these policies on the diagnostics industry and the healthcare sector as a whole. This Interim Budget was neutral for the Diagnostics industry, we hope for the favourable budget in the Final budget.”

Pavan Choudary, Chairman, Medical Technology Association of India (MTaI) & Managing Director, of Vygon India, said: “The schemes for maternal and childcare which are currently in place are disparate and sometimes deficient. Bringing them under one common, standardized platform would help deliver optimal and comprehensive care throughout India. While the customs duty has not gone down which was our expectation, and remains at the same level, this itself will take FDI in MedTech to a never-before high this financial year. However, if the government had reduced the customs duties, the FDI in MedTech could have taken a meteoric trajectory.”

Sanjay Bhutani, Board Member, MTaI & Managing Director, Bausch & Lomb said: “With schemes like cervical cancer vaccination for younger girls and covering Anganwadi and Asha workers under Ayushman Bharat, this budget emphasized on healthcare, especially for women, adolescents, and children. Also, the plan to increase the number of medical colleges using the existing infrastructure will surely enhance the healthcare facilities in tier 2 tier 3 cities. However, we feel if customs duty on medical devices were reduced, India would further its journey to become the global hub for medical tourism. Also, we were expecting the Direct taxes and personal income taxes to go down which would have attracted more FDI and put more money in the hands of consumers, respectively.”

Nikhil Chopra, CEO & Whole Time Director, JB Pharma: “The Government has outlined some transformative initiatives in this Budget. The allocation of a substantial corpus for R&D, reflects a bold commitment to boosting innovation across sectors including the pharmaceutical industry. This financial support will undoubtedly catalyze research and development, fostering a culture of innovation and excellence. This is in line with the Prime Minister’s dedication towards the cause, which was exemplified by the previously emphasized slogan ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, and Jai Anusandhan’. The forward-thinking emphasis on women’s health, particularly in preventing cervical cancer, aligns seamlessly with the global push for eradicating preventable diseases. These initiatives, complemented by a comprehensive Maternal and Child health care agenda and the extension of Ayushman Bharat to ASHA and Anganwadi workers, underscore the government’s forward-looking approach towards women’s health. The implementation of the U-Win platform reflects a strategic move towards leveraging technology for streamlined immunization management, enhancing accessibility and monitoring of healthcare programs. The intensified efforts of Mission Indradhanush will play a pivotal role in increasing access to essential immunization across the country. Furthermore, it’s notable to observe the increasing participation of women in the workforce, showcasing the positive impact of past measures, and this trend is poised to continue flourishing and support India’s growth journey. Overall, the budget has not only created an optimistic environment for the sector but also laid a solid foundation for advancements in healthcare, research, and education.”

Dr. Prathap C. Reddy, Chairman of Apollo Hospitals said: “I am happy with the Interim Union Budget 2024, presented by the Finance Minister under the esteemed leadership of our Hon’ble Prime Minister. Firstly, we must bear in mind that education and healthcare are fundamental rights and I am glad that these cornerstones of growth have been addressed. With the rise in the disease burden globally and the acute shortage of trained health manpower, India is well positioned to ‘Heal the World’, by harnessing its youth to become highly skilled manpower. Therefore, I welcome the strategy to augment medical education by capitalizing on existing hospital infrastructures. In doing so, we are not only paving the way for an increased number of medical and nursing colleges, but also enhancing the capacity for para-medical training. Further, with the emphasis on skilling, India will emerge as a beacon for global workforce development, bringing financial stability to families and attracting foreign exchange. Secondly, unless India heightens its focus on innovation and research, as a nation, we will not be able to overcome the looming disease burden, e.g., the alarming increase in AMR, undetected heart disease and cancers. Innovative solutions to make healthcare accessible and affordable is truly the need of the hour. Hence, the creation of a corpus of ₹1 lakh crore to provide 50-year loans at low or nil interest rates to encourage the private sector to scale up research and innovate in sunrise sectors is commendable. Finally, with women-led development as the way forward for India, as championed by the Hon’ble Prime Minister, the numerous initiatives including integration of maternal and child care programs, extending the cover of Ayushman Bharat scheme for ASHA and Anganwadi workers, the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0′ initiative aimed at improving nutrition, and thrust to inoculate young girls against cervical cancer, demonstrate our unwavering commitment to the well-being of India’s daughters. However, I remain concerned over the growing threat of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and urge the government to consider increasing the tax exemption for preventive healthcare. At large though, the Union Budget 2024 is clearly a clarion call to action, rallying India towards a radiant future.”

Dr. Vishal Arora, Chief of Business Transformation & Operational Excellence, Artemis Hospitals: “In India the doctor to patient ratio is below the recommended levels by international organisations such as World Health Organisation (WHO). The same is concentrated in metros and urban cities resulting in the lack of access to quality healthcare for the people of Tier 2/3 cities and villages requiring them to travel long distances to avail basic healthcare needs which in turn increases the overall healthcare expenditures. Addressing this disparity is vital for enhancing the overall healthcare accessibility in India. The recent announcement in the budget today by our Finance Minister regarding strengthening of the medical colleges network by utilizing the existing hospital infrastructure is a strategic and welcoming decision.

This initiative promises to bridge the current gap in medical infrastructure by fostering a synergistic relationship between medical education and healthcare delivery. This approach, leveraging shared resources, is beneficial for both sectors and marks a significant step towards meeting the healthcare needs of the Indian population”.

Satish Kannan, Co-founder & CEO, MediBuddy: “The government’s interim budget highlights a strategic focus on preventive healthcare. Prioritizing the enhancement of immunization coverage is a crucial focus, which is achieved by utilizing both the U-WIN digital platform and the Mission Indradhanush initiative. Utilizing these strategic tools and initiatives by the government streamlines the immunization process and contributes significantly to providing access to quality healthcare to a larger population. Plans to establish additional medical colleges using the existing hospital infrastructure reflect a commitment to training future doctors and building regional capacity to achieve universal healthcare access. It can significantly enhance and supplement overburdened metropolitan healthcare systems. The healthcare insurance coverage under Ayushman Bharat will now extend to frontline health workers, such as ASHA and Anganwadi staff. As a health tech startup aiming to enhance preventive care, these measures affirm the necessity and potential within this domain. The policy’s focus on providing fiscal support for prevention as the primary aspect of healthcare will stimulate innovation in technologies like early detection and screening, remote diagnostics, personal health management, digital therapeutics, and many more. Indian health tech startups now have a significant opportunity to supplement government initiatives in preventive healthcare. The extended tax incentives for startups further enhance the ecosystem’s potential to explore sustainable solutions. The startups can drive the next wave of preventive healthcare adoption throughout towns and villages in India, thereby improving overall health outcomes and the quality of life for billions of Indians.”

Anil Matai, Director General, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI): “OPPI commends the Government’s approach towards the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector in the Union Budget 2024. The emphasis on leveraging existing hospital infrastructure for establishing new medical colleges is a strategic move that aligns with the need for a robust healthcare workforce. Moreover, the initiative to encourage vaccination for girls aged 9-14 to prevent cervical cancer demonstrates a proactive stance on preventive healthcare. The extension of health coverage under the Ayushman Bharat scheme to ASHA and Anganwadi workers and helpers is a commendable step towards achieving universal health coverage. The allocation of a ₹1 lakh crore corpus for long-term, interest-free loans will provide long-term financing or refinancing with long tenors and low or nil interest rates. This will encourage the private sector to scale up research and innovation significantly in sunrise domains. The pharma industry is ready to embrace this opportunity for growth and contribute to the nation’s health and well-being. The swift rollout of the U-WIN platform for managing immunization and the intensified efforts of Mission Indradhanush will further give boost to India’s immunization targets. OPPI is proud of the exponential growth in FDI inflow achieved by the government from 2014-23, and it truly underscores the confidence of global investors in India. OPPI and its members wholeheartedly support any balanced & equitable steps of the government which are in line with the ‘first develop India’ spirit. While we appreciate the positive strides taken in the Union Budget 2024 towards the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector, we were also hoping that a nuanced approach to reduce duty/tax burdens on innovative & lifesaving drugs, addressing regulatory challenges and facilitating ease of doing business could have been outlined. Overall, the Union Budget 2024 reflects a forward-looking approach, and the pharmaceutical sector looks forward to actively participating in and contributing to the realization of these transformative initiatives.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-top-reactions-from-healthcare-industry-leaders-who-said-what-on-nirmala-sitharamans-announcements-3382012/
financialexpress.com,Interim Budget 2024: PM Awas Yojana to ‘Lakhpati Didi’ – Schemes Nirmala Sitharaman spoke about,"Union Budget 2024 Schemes: Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday presented the interim Union Budget 2024-25 and announced that the Ayushman Bharat scheme will be extended to all ASHA and Anganwadi workers. Sitharaman presented her sixth straight Budget ahead of the Lok Sabha election that is scheduled in April-May this year.

The Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri-Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) is the largest publicly funded health insurance scheme in the world. It provides a coverage of Rs five lakh for each family every year for secondary and tertiary hospitalisation.

A total of 55 crore people from 12 crore families were covered under the Ayushman Bharat scheme till December 27, 2023.



The finance minister also announced that the BJP-led NDA government will launch a housing scheme for deserving middle class to buy or build their own houses.

She also said that a total of 25 crore people got freedom from multi-dimensional poverty over the last 10 years.

Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin

The Union Finance Minister also announced that two crore more houses will be built under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin.

“Despite COVID, this continued, and we’re close to achieving the target of 3 crore houses. 2 crore more houses will be taken up in the next 5 years to meet the need arising from increase in number of families,” the FM said.

On the recent roof-top solarisation scheme that was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the FM said, “Through roof-top solarisation, 1 crore households will be enabled to obtain up to 300 units of free electricity every month. This scheme follows the resolve of the Prime Minister on the historic day of the consecration of Shri Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.”

Sitharaman also said that as many as 11.8 crore farmers were provided financial assistance under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Yojana, which is dubbed as the world’s largest Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme.

The scheme, which was effective from 2018, provides a financial benefit of Rs 6,000 per year in three equal four-monthly instalments, and the money is directly transferred to the bank accounts of the individuals.

Sitharaman on Nari Shakti

Speaking about ‘Nari Shakti’, the union finance minister said that there has been ‘momentum for Nari Shakti’, and empowerment of women through entrepreneurship in the last 10 years.



“30 crore Mudra Yojana loans have been given to women entrepreneurs…Making triple talaq illegal, reservation of one -thirds seats for the women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies and giving over 70 percent houses under PM Awas Yojana in rural areas to women as sole or joint owner has enhanced their dignity,” the union finance minister said.

To empower women in rural areas, Sitharaman announced the expansion of the ‘Lakhpati Didi’ scheme. The target, which was initially set for two crore women, has been enhanced to three crore women.

On maternal and child heathcare, Sitharaman said that the Union government will encourage vaccination for girls aged 9-14 years for cervical cancer.

“Various schemes for maternal and child healthcare will be brought in synergy. Anganwadis will be upgraded,” she said.

On the Skill India Mission, Sitharaman said that about 1.4 crore youth were trained and skilled under the mission, which focuses in skilling, re-skilling and upskilling through short-term and long-term training programmes.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Income Tax: Analysing Old vs new tax regime; Which is good for you?,"The government has been implementing significant revisions aimed at encouraging taxpayers to embrace the new tax regime. Which was introduced in the Union Budget 2020. While the new tax regime offered concessional tax rates, it restricted taxpayers from claiming several exemptions and deductions such as HRA, LTA, 80C, and 80D.

Here’s a look at key amendments

The central government increased the tax rebate threshold to Rs 7 lakhs from the previous Rs 5 lakhs under the old tax regime. Consequently, individuals with incomes up to Rs 7 lakhs are exempt from paying any taxes under the new tax regime.

Streamlined Tax slabs

In the 2023 Budget amendments, the tax exemption limit was increased to Rs 3 lakhs, accompanied by revised tax slabs.



Income up to Rs 3,00,000: Nil

Income from Rs 3,00,001 to Rs 6,00,000: 5%

Income from Rs 6,00,001 to Rs 9,00,000: 10%

Income from Rs 9,00,001 to Rs 12,00,000: 15%

Income from Rs 12,00,001 to Rs 15,00,000: 20%

Income above Rs 15,00,001: 30%

Old Tax regime overview

Before the new tax regime, taxpayers operating under the old regime were provided access to over 70 exemptions and deductions, including Home Rent Allowance (HRA) and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA). These deductions effectively reduced taxable income and lowered tax liabilities.

Notably, Section 80C stood out as one of the most popular and generous deductions, allowing for a reduction of taxable income up to Rs. 1.5 lakh.

Income Tax Slabs 2023-24 (Old Regime)

Up to Rs 250,000: Nil

Rs 250,001 to Rs 500,000: 5%

Rs 500,001 to Rs 1,000,000: 20%

Above Rs 1,000,000: 30%

Additional Considerations for Old Tax regime

For resident individuals aged above 60 years (senior citizens), the basic exemption limit stands at Rs 300,000. Similarly, for super senior citizens (above 80 years), the basic exemption limit is Rs 500,000.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-income-tax-analysing-old-vs-new-tax-regime-which-is-good-for-you-3380706/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 reality pill: Amid cervical cancer vaccine buzz, no word on GST demand miffs health industry","Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday tabled the interim budget 2024. From cervical cancer to the upgradation of Anganwadi centres, the Finance Minister made some crucial announcements for the healthcare sector.

Following the interim budget 2024, key industry leaders in healthcare lauded the budget proposals. However, they also pointed out that some of the long-standing demands still need to be addressed.

Hitesh Sharma, Partner, Life Sciences Leader – Tax, EY India, said that given the Government’s perspective of keeping the interim budget an on-account vote, the Finance Minister did not dwell into any specifics, leaving the changes for the full budget post-elections. While she spoke of the past performance, as far as the Health Science Sector is concerned, there were some perspectives on things to come in the future, Sharma highlighted.



“There was a commitment to focus on setting up medical colleges in existing hospitals, focus on women healthcare with encouragement of cervical cancer vaccination for young girls, maternal and childcare related schemes for improved nutrition delivery, early childhood care and development etc. The focus on research and innovation was given a further boost by announcing a one lakh crore corpus for providing interest free loan for a long duration for research and innovation for private sector. Also the cover under Ayushman Bharat Scheme has been extended to cover ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers and helpers,” Sharma said.

On the tax front, the expectation of extension of concessional tax regime of 15% for manufacturing facilities beyond 31 March 2024 remained unmet, he maintained.

“While we will look at the full budget in July for more details, what is also positive is that there is an increase in outlay on Health for FY 2024-25 versus the revised estimates for FY 2023-24. So overall the budget continues the path for growth of healthcare and access in India,” he added.

Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance maintained that the Interim Union Budget 2024 focuses on Viksit Bharat and spells out broad strategy for comprehensive development of the nation.

“The Pharmaceutical sector is a knowledge-driven industry and the emphasis on innovation is of vital importance. The industry aims to move up the value chain by spending on innovation and R&D. The Government has announced further strengthening healthcare infrastructure with an emphasis on skilling, leveraging technology for immunisation and increasing health coverage of Ayushman Bharat. The focus on healthcare will further India’s overall development. We look forward to the thrust on research and innovation in pharma during the comprehensive budget later this year,” Jain said.

Meanwhile, some experts expressed their disappointment with the announcements for the interim budget 2024.

Dr. B. S. Ajaikumar, Executive Chairman, Healthcare Global Enterprises Ltd. said that he is “thoroughly” disappointed with the interim budget.

“To its credit, the government certainly means good by announcing its plan to set up medical colleges by utilising existing medical infrastructure or extending the benefits of Ayushman Bharat to ASHA and Anganwadi workers. The cervical cancer vaccination for girls aged 9-14yrs is certainly a prudent and proactive measure. Having said that, I don’t see any plan of a larger scale and scope that can address the multifarious healthcare needs on an immediate basis. Talking of schemes like Ayushman Bharat, there is an acute need to improve and upgrade the quality of subsidised treatments, but there has been no announcement to this effect,” Dr. Ajaikumar said.

Like every year, we hoped the government would allocate a significantly higher percentage of GDP allocation, but again there has been nothing to cheer about on this front, he said.

“We hope the next budget will take firm steps towards adopting an effective universal healthcare model in the form of unlimited pay-outs and make use of latest developments and advancements like targeted therapies even at the grassroots,” he added.

Dr Roderico H. Ofrin, WHO Representative to India, said that ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers, and helpers are at the forefront of health and care delivery at the grassroots level. The World Health Organization (WHO) applauds the extension of healthcare coverage to them under Ayushman Bharat, he said.

“The initiatives announced today – upgrading existing hospital infrastructure to increase medical colleges, harmonization of maternal and child care implementation, introduction of HPV vaccination for cervical cancer prevention, and the expansion of the U-WIN platform across for managing and intensifying immunization – will further strengthen systems and healthcare services across the country,” Dr. Ofrin said.

WHO welcomes investments in these areas and will continue to support the Government of India in achieving health for all and meeting its disease elimination goals, he said.

Dr Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, MD and CEO, Fortis Healthcare & President, NATHEALTH said that 2024 budget takes a forward-looking approach to healthcare.

“Establishing a committee to expand medical colleges within existing hospital infrastructure addresses the shortage of healthcare professionals and strengthens medical education. Additionally, the initiative to combat cervical cancer through HPV vaccination for girls aged 9-14 in six states is proactive in disease prevention. Extending Ayushman Bharat coverage to Anganwadi and Asha workers recognises their vital role in community health, and consolidating maternal and child healthcare schemes emphasises holistic well-being. Furthermore, the introduction of the U-Win platform for immunisation management, combined with intensified efforts like Mission Indradhanush, demonstrates a technology-driven approach to vaccination,” Dr. Raghuvanshi said.

However, it’s worth mentioning that some long-standing demands, like GST rationalisation and increased investments in the healthcare sector, needs to be addressed. We anticipate their consideration in the upcoming comprehensive budget, he said.

Ameera Shah, Promoter and Managing Director, Metropolis Healthcare highlighted that while the Interim budget takes commendable steps in healthcare, the 1-lakh crore allocation for private sector R&D with 50-year interest-free financing is positive for innovation.

“Strengthening healthcare infrastructure by establishing additional medical colleges effectively addresses the critical shortage of healthcare professionals. Equally noteworthy is the government’s initiative to launch a cervical cancer vaccination drive for girls aged 9-14 and consolidate maternal and child healthcare schemes under one program, demonstrating a proactive approach to preventive healthcare. Acknowledging these initiatives, we had hoped for deeper investment and resource allocation in the healthcare sector. India should prioritize and invest more in healthcare, exploring Public-Private Partnerships to enhance services without significantly increasing budgets,” Shah said.

There is a need for regular and inclusive screening, along with more skilling courses for healthcare professionals to attract and upskill talent in the healthcare space, she said. Additionally, the diagnostic sector requires a 0% GST on services and refunds for GST paid on inputs, she added.

Dr Jagprag Singh Gujral, SVP MDO/ Head of Emerging Markets, Varian (a Siemens Healthineers Company) and Group CEO- CTSI hailed the renewed focus on preventive initiatives for Cancer such as Cervical cancer the FM alluded to.

“Talent pool enhancement through the announcement for Medical Colleges and extension of the Ayushmann Bharat scheme are welcome positives for the growing middle class youth and the healthcare industry. The interim budget from a healthcare announcements perspective is in line with the optimism in India’s growth story,” Dr. Gujral said.

Viren Shetty, Executive Vice Chairman of Narayana Health’ applauded the decision to cover ASHA and Anganwadi workers under the Ayushman Bharat scheme.

“Recognizing the need for providing Universal Health Care, the interim Union Budget 2024-25 extended the Ayushman Bharat scheme to cover nearly over three million ASHAs and Anganwadi workers. In a noteworthy move, the budget also unveiled a roadmap for addressing long-term capacity building by investing in healthcare infrastructure, and converting existing hospitals into medical and nursing colleges. This will go a long way towards addressing the skill shortage in the healthcare industry and create millions of jobs. These initiatives align with our commitment to provide comprehensive health coverage across all our hospitals,” Shetty said.

Additionally, D. S. Negi, CEO, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre (RGCIRC) said that initiatives like the establishment of a committee to create additional medical colleges by leveraging existing hospital infrastructure under various departments, promoting vaccination of girls aged 9-14 to prevent cervical cancer, and expanding the Ayushman Bharat scheme to all ASHA workers, Anganwadi Workers, and Helpers are steps in the right direction.

“These measures will certainly put together will help address key issues of shortage of health workers, increase access to quality healthcare, and prevention of life-threatening diseases. However, we hope the government will prioritize other pressing issues in the healthcare sector and provide budgetary incentives in the upcoming full budget,” Dr. Negi said.

Dr. Harshit Jain, Founder & Global CEO, Doceree claimed that the FY 2024-25 interim budget, announced by our Hon’ble Finance Minister, heralds a transformative phase for all industries, including Health-tech.

“The allocation of 50-year interest-free loans for technology-supported startups is commendable, poised to inspire youth, fostering innovation for groundbreaking healthcare solutions. The re-emphasis on ‘Anusandhan’ reflects a push for high-level strategic research, reinforcing the pharmaceutical industry’s commitment to tailored treatments for India’s diverse population. Further, the decision to expand medical educational institutions using existing hospital infrastructure underscores the government’s dedication to a skilled healthcare workforce, strengthening our healthcare system. The budget’s focus on maternal and early childhood healthcare, backed by new schemes, also promises improved outcomes. As a leader in healthcare transformation, Doceree wholeheartedly welcomes India’s persistent efforts to enhance healthcare efficacy through technology-driven initiatives,” Dr. Jain said.

Joydeep Ghosh, partner, industry leader—life science & health care, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP claimed that the healthcare sector has found prominence in the Interim Budget, with policy announcements aimed at empowering youth and facilitating inclusive development.

“These include setting up of more medical colleges by utilizing existing hospital infrastructure to provide greater opportunity to the youth. This should help to develop the talent pool for the sector and capitalize on growing requirements. Other noteworthy announcements reflect a progressive approach touching upon important aspects like preventive vaccination against cervical cancer and increasing focus on maternal and child health care including nutrition together with effective use of technology. Overall, good policy intent for the sector,” Ghosh said.

Moreover, Dr Sangita Reddy, JMD, Apollo Hospitals Group highlighted that 2024 budget highlighted the need for investments in the healthcare sector. The focus is on preventive care, women’s health, infrastructure expansion, and child development.

“In order to protect women’s health, the budget promotes cervical cancer prevention by encouraging vaccination for girls aged 9-14. The budget proposes establishing more medical colleges by utilizing existing hospital infrastructure to address the increasing demand for medical professionals. It also plans to establish new nursing colleges alongside recently established medical colleges. There are plans outlined to upgrade Anganwadi centers and implement a comprehensive maternal and child healthcare program in recognition of the significance of early childhood development. To ensure wider coverage of immunization, the budget introduces the U-Win platform to improve immunization program management and intensifies Mission Indradhanush with the goal of achieving higher immunization rates across the country,” Dr. Reddy said.

We also need some measures to address challenges such as shortage of healthcare facilities in rural areas, and awareness toward NCDs that lead to life-threatening complications and deaths, she said.

“Apart from that, some important points such as mental health, telemedicine and robotic surgeries that are minimally invasive and give successful outcomes can be included in the July budget. Overall, this budget is satisfying and can help to strengthen the healthcare system of the country especially considering it is an interim budget,” she added.

Chandra Ganjoo, Group Chief Executive Officer, Trivitron Healthcare said that the finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman presented the interim budget for 2024, outlining a strategic vision for healthy economic development. In her address, the Finance Minister emphasized India’s resilience in overcoming the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the establishment of foundations for a self-reliant nation.

“Notable initiatives for the healthcare sector include a significant focus on maternal and child healthcare through the introduction of Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0. Cutting-edge technologies like Newborn Screening, provided by Trivitron Healthcare, will play a crucial role in early health issue detection in newborns. Proposing the integration of newborn screening as a national program accessible in every hospital and maternity centre across the nation underscores the commitment to securing childhood and fostering holistic development. Additionally, the Finance Minister also announced a mission to eradicate sickle cell anemia by 2047, involving the screening of seven crore people, marking a transformative step in the diagnostic industry,” Ganjoo said.

Addressing public health concerns, the government advocates for the vaccination of girls aged 9-14 against cervical cancer. This initiative, focusing on awareness, early HPV screening, and vaccination, aims to empower females to enhance their reproductive health and protect against the consequences of cervical cancer, Ganjoo said.

Recognizing the scarcity of medical professionals, the government plans to construct more medical hospitals and colleges, contributing to an improved healthcare landscape in India, Ganjoo highlighted.

“The 2024 budget reflects a strategic approach to healthcare, prioritizing maternal and child well-being, disease prevention, and the overall enhancement of the healthcare infrastructure. While specific measures for the MedTech industry were not detailed, Trivitron Healthcare remains committed to delivering best healthcare solutions and investing in research and development to transform and evolve the MedTech sector,” she said.

Meanwhile, Dheer Shah, CFO of BDR Pharmaceuticals, said that in the evolving landscape of healthcare, where innovation intersects with compassion, the government’s initiatives mark a pivotal stride towards holistic well-being.

“As the curtains rise on FY2023-24, the commitment to allocate Rs 45,03,097 crore reflects a resolute dedication to fortify our healthcare infrastructure. The emphasis on cervical cancer vaccination for young girls underscores a proactive approach towards preventive care, while extending Ayushman Bharat coverage to ASHA and Anganwadi workers exemplifies a recognition of their invaluable contribution to public health,” he added.

Consolidating maternal and child healthcare schemes echoes a harmonized vision for streamlined implementation and amplified impact. Simultaneously, the impetus on bio-manufacturing and bio-foundry heralds a sustainable paradigm shift, where innovation converges with environmental stewardship, he said.

“At BDR Pharmaceuticals, we recognize the importance of sustainable healthcare solutions. The announcement of the bio-manufacturing and bio-foundry scheme resonates deeply with our commitment to environmental stewardship. By fostering the development of eco-friendly alternatives such as biodegradable polymers, bio-plastics, and bio-pharmaceuticals, this initiative aligns with our ethos of responsible manufacturing, he added.

Sanjiv Navangul, Managing Director & CEO, Bharat Serums and Vaccines Ltd. (BSV) said that they are encouraged with the recent budget announcement that lays emphasis and much-deserved attention on women’s health.

“With all maternal and child healthcare schemes under one comprehensive programme, the collective vision of Healthy Women, Healthy Pregnancies and Healthy Future is turning into reality. Added to this, HPV vaccinations for girls in the 9-14 age group for the prevention of cervical cancer, immunisations of children, and schemes such as Poshan 2.0 will help improve nutrition delivery, early childhood care, and development,” Navangul said.

The government’s efforts to build capabilities and domestic capacities will augment the existing healthcare infrastructure and will ensure that healthcare reaches every home in India, he said.

Dr. Sanjeev Singh, Medical Director, Amrita Hospital, Faridabad said that the finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has presented a people-centric budget today.

“The government’s commitment to preventive healthcare is commendable. It is evident in the emphasis on vaccinating girls, between the ages of 9 and fourteen, against cervical cancer. Additionally, consolidating maternal and child care schemes under a comprehensive program is a strategic move that will enhance efficiency. The focus on upgrading anganwadi centers through ‘Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0’ is promising for improved nutrition and early childhood development. We, at Amrita Hospital, Faridabad, applaud the government’s proactive approach towards public health with the swift implementation of the U-WIN platform for immunization management, Dr. Singh highlighted.

The integration of Mission Indradhanush’s intensified efforts into this initiative reflects a commitment to reaching every corner of the country efficiently. This collaborative and technology-driven strategy is poised to revolutionize immunization programs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and safeguarding the health of our nation, he said.

“We are particularly encouraged by the announcement of new nursing colleges co-located with medical colleges, supporting our shared goal of advancing healthcare education. Furthermore, the mission to eliminate sickle cell anaemia by 2047, involving the screening of seven crore people, reflects a visionary commitment to eradicating genetic disorders. These initiatives align with our shared goal of advancing public health, and we look forward to witnessing the positive impact on the well-being of our communities,” he said.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-reality-pill-amid-cervical-cancer-vaccine-buzz-no-word-on-gst-demand-miffs-health-industry-3381797/

Union Budget 2024 LIVE: Key numbers to be watch

Here are the crucial figures to monitor in the pre-election Budget for 2024-25:

Fiscal Deficit: The budgeted fiscal deficit for the current fiscal ending March 2024 is 5.9%, down from 6.4% in the previous fiscal. Eyes will be on the 2024-25 fiscal deficit as expectations rise for increased government spending in an election year.

Disinvestment/Privatisation: The anticipated disinvestment target for the current fiscal might be missed, as in the past five years. A realistic target below Rs 50,000 crore is expected for the next fiscal.

Capital Expenditure: The government's planned capital expenditure for the current fiscal is set at Rs 10 lakh crore, up from Rs 7.3 lakh crore in the previous fiscal. The focus on infrastructure development and state-level capex incentives continues.

Tax Revenue: The Budget aimed for direct and indirect tax collections of Rs 18.23 lakh crore and Rs 15.29 lakh crore for the current fiscal, totaling Rs 33.61 lakh crore. Buoyant GST, income, and corporate tax collections are anticipated to exceed the budget estimates.

Borrowing: The government's gross borrowing budget for the current fiscal is Rs 15.43 lakh crore. Market attention will be on borrowing figures, especially considering expected higher capital expenditures for growth and potential populist announcements.

Nominal GDP: The estimated nominal GDP growth (real GDP plus inflation) for the current fiscal is 11%. The Budget is expected to provide an outline of nominal GDP growth numbers. Real GDP growth is projected at 7.3% for the current fiscal and 7% for the next.

Key Spending Areas: Focus will be on spending in critical schemes such as NREGA and key sectors like health and education. These areas are likely to be under the spotlight for budget allocations.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-live-updates-interim-budget-live-infrastructure-railways-education-healthcare-auto-nirmala-sitharaman-budget-speech-3379348/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: What FM Nirmala Sitharaman can do to enhance the appeal of New Tax Regime,"A majority of taxpayers are aware of the New Tax Regime (also called the Concessional Tax Regime), which was introduced in the Budget 2020, wherein tax slabs were altered and taxpayers were offered concessional tax rates. However, as taxpayers opting for the New Regime can’t claim several exemptions and deductions, this has made this regime unattractive for a large number of taxpayers, especially in the higher income tax brackets.

For instance, a recent survey conducted by Policybazaar.com has revealed that although the introduction of the New Regime has marked a significant change in the financial landscape, yet the deeply ingrained savings culture remains a predominant force shaping individuals’ choices. No wonder, the Old Regime continues to retain popularity among taxpayers by a margin. Despite the New Tax Regime becoming the default option now, there emerges a distinct preference, with 63% takers for the Old Tax Regime and 37% for the New Regime owing to the tax-saving benefits and a sense of security offered by long-term savings instruments that one can leverage in the former.

Therefore, while taxpayers and tax experts are seeking more tax sops under the Old Tax Regime in the Budget 2024, there is also demand for making the New Tax Regime more attractive by introducing some tax deductions under this regime.





Dr. Suresh Surana, Founder, RSM India, says, “Under the existing provisions of the concessional tax regime u/s 115BAC of the I-T Act (also known as the default tax regime), a majority of tax deductions /exemptions are not available to the taxpayers except salary standard deduction, employer’s contribution to National Pension Scheme u/s 80CCD(2), etc. As such, some essential deductions should be allowed to salaried taxpayers to bring them at par with other taxpayers.”

The key recommendations include:

(i) The concessional tax regime u/s 115BAC may provide for adequate deduction for social security contributions such as payments towards EPF contribution, LIC premium, investment in National Savings Certificate, Public Provident Fund, employee’s contribution to NPS, etc. Allowing such deductions would ensure social security benefits to the individual taxpayers as well as facilitate the savings culture.



(ii) The concessional tax regime does not provide deduction for mediclaim premium incurred and as such individuals are sceptical about opting for the new regime. Considering that most of the individual taxpayers incur expenditure for the purpose of their medical wellbeing, providing such deduction would encourage individual taxpayers to opt for the new regime.

(iii) Individual taxpayers opting for the concessional tax regime u/s 115BAC are not allowed to claim deduction of home loan interest u/s 24(b) as well as setoff of loss from house property against any other head of income. “Due to the current stability in the real estate market, many individual taxpayers have opted for purchase of house property and most of those who have taken a housing loan are incurring interest costs on their newly-owned property. Thus, concessional tax regime may allow individual taxpayers to claim interest deduction as well as setoff such house property losses against salary income in order to incentivize them to opt for such concessional tax regime,” says Surana.

Thus, the deductions available to individuals under the Old Tax Regime, such as the deduction of health insurance paid and employee contributions towards NPS, should be extended to the New Tax Regime as well, so as to promote equitable access to healthcare and encourage savings and investments among taxpayers.

Shuddhasattwa Ghosh, Tax Partner, EY India, says, “To make the concessional tax regime (CTR) more attractive for individuals, the government could look at allowing certain exemptions/ deductions such as interest on housing loan for self-occupied property, contribution towards EPF, PPF, NPS, insurance payments (both life and health) etc. Also, taxpayers may be allowed to opt for the CTR in the revised and belated tax returns as well.”

Adhil Shetty, CEO, Bankbazaar.com, is also of the view that to encourage more taxpayers to choose the New Tax Regime, the government should implement further reductions in tax rates. Also, raising the current basic threshold would likely offer some relief to middle-class taxpayers.

To further enhance the appeal of the New Regime, the government should consider to lower the highest tax rate from 30% to 25% and increase the income threshold for this highest rate from Rs 15,00,000 to Rs 20,00,000.

“Additionally, raising the standard deduction limit and the basic exemption limit would provide more financial relief to taxpayers,” suggests Maneesh Bawa, Partner, Nangia Andersen LLP.

He adds that the government should also allow the set-off for house property loss under the New regime. “This would be a major incentive for taxpayers to switch to the new system, as it could potentially offset some of the lost deductions from the Old Regime.”

Will the Old Tax Regime be gradually phased out?

In the Union Budget 2023, the government had made it very clear that the new scheme of taxation would be the scheme for the future. Hence going forward, there would be no deduction on the investments, etc which are now available u/s 80C.

However, “there is a clear divide between the taxpayers who choose the new scheme and those who choose the old scheme. The new scheme is chosen by new entrants in the tax net whereas the established taxpayers choose the old scheme. It is expected that the new scheme would also be made ‘Hybrid’ by bringing certain graded deductions to make the new scheme attractive to the established taxpayers also,” says Vivek Jalan, Partner, Tax Connect Advisory.

It is pertinent to note that in the last budget standard deduction was introduced in the new scheme and this could be the beginning of a ‘Single Hybrid Regime’.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-what-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-can-do-to-enhance-the-appeal-of-new-tax-regime-3379213/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024 Expectations: No big-bang measures likely; govt’s priority would be to achieve fiscal discipline, say economists","With the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman all set to present the interim Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 on February 1, 2024, economists said that despite it being a vote on account, the government will continue with thrust on fiscal consolidation, easements of business and taxation laws, infrastructure, MSMEs, and financial inclusion. Suman Chowdhury, Chief Economist and Head-Research, Acuité Ratings & Research, said, “Given the priority that is likely to be given for fiscal consolidation in the upcoming budget, we don’t expect any significant fiscal stimulus in it. However, the government may continue to earmark a significant quantum for capital expenditure with a growth of 15 per cent in its budgetary allocation; the latter will continue to be a primary driver of the domestic economy over the medium term.”

Economists opined that the government is most likely to continue with the large number of measures around the previous budgets to sustain economic growth and create employment opportunities.

Here is what economists and experts are expecting from the interim Budget…



Suman Chowdhury, Chief Economist and Head-Research, Acuité Ratings & Research

We expect the Indian economy to witness a moderation in growth in FY25. Our current forecast for FY25 stands at 6.3% as compared to 6.8% in FY24. Given the priority that is likely to be given for fiscal consolidation in the upcoming budget, we don’t expect any significant fiscal stimulus in it. However, the government may continue to earmark a significant quantum for capital expenditure with a growth of 15% in its budgetary allocation; the latter will continue to be a primary driver of the domestic economy over the medium term. The government may also enhance the subsidy allocation for some segments such as farmers, women, informal sector workers and unemployed youth to strengthen domestic private consumption which is estimated to show a weak growth of 4.4% in FY24. Given the need to sustain the public investments and also support certain social segments through subsidies or budgetary relief, the targeted reduction of fiscal deficit from 5.9% to 5.3% (E) will pose a material challenge for the finance ministry, necessitating significant step-up in non-tax revenues like PSU disinvestments.

The macro fundamentals remain strong and resilient and this is borne out by the GDP figures so far in the current year despite headwinds like the global slowdown, higher interest rates and the El Nino phenomenon. However, the policymakers need to take remedial measures to revive the weak rural demand scenario if agricultural growth doesn’t recover quickly.”

Ashwajit Singh, Managing Director, IPE Global

Being an interim budget, the government is expected to continue with the large number measures around in the previous budgets to sustain economic growth and create employment opportunities. Continuing to focus on the promise of inclusive and long-term growth, the budget is expected to address both the needs of the vulnerable sections of the society while also continuing with reforms for ease of doing business, promoting ‘Make in India’ innovation, and pushing up private investments. Budget 2024 presents an opportunity to build confidence and attract investment and for a Viksit Bharat – to transform the nation into a developed entity by the centenary of our independence in 2047.

Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services

There is a high level of uncertainty about the possible proposals in the interim budget. The finance minister had gone on record stating that “there won’t be any spectacular announcements” in the interim budget. So it is most likely to be a vote on account plus some possible relief in income tax for the lower income tax slabs. Major public capex is unlikely since the FM has to achieve the fiscal deficit target of 5.9 per cent for FY24 targeted in the 2023 budget. Also the massive public expenditure done through the budget provision last year has helped in triggering growth in the Indian economy. Therefore, the government’s priority would be to achieve fiscal discipline.

Rahul Ahluwalia, Co-founder, Foundation for Economic Development

India’s path to growth lies in prioritising exports to global markets, which are vast compared to the domestic Indian market. The government’s ambitious target of exporting goods and services worth $2 trillion by 2030, and the spectacular growth of electronics exports last year inspire confidence that policy-wise, we have the right targets in mind. However, till October ’23, India’s overall merchandise exports had declined by 5.5% year-on-year. High tariffs on imports result in costlier inputs and reduces the competitiveness of downstream Indian exports in international markets. Since this will be a vote on account or an interim budget before the general elections, it is unlikely to have any big announcements. Still, reductions of import duties are well within its ambit. Given the government’s focus on exports, we think that the budget will reduce tariffs to foster competitiveness and enable Indian industry to thrive globally.

Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist and Head – Research and Outreach, ICRA

With the upcoming Union Budget for 2024-25 set to be an interim one for the purpose of a vote-on-account, major policy changes and announcements are unlikely. However, the expansion in the Government of India’s (GoI’s) capex and the extent of fiscal consolidation would be scrutinised closely, given the implications for growth and G-sec yields, respectively. ICRA expects the fiscal deficit target for FY2025 to be set at 5.3% of GDP, midway through the expected print of 6.0% for FY2024 and the medium-term target of sub-4.5% by FY2026. This, along with our projection of an appreciable dip in the revenue deficit, would allow for a capex target of Rs 10.2 trillion for FY 2025, 10% higher than the expected level for FY2024 vis-à-vis the 20%-plus YoY expansion seen during FY2021-FY2024. A higher capex target would impinge on the GoI’s ability to bridge half the required fiscal consolidation in FY2025, thereby making the task of reaching medium-term fiscal deficit target by FY2026 even more challenging.

Suraj Pratap Malik, Whole-Time Director, Infomerics Ratings

This is a budget with a difference since it is a ‘Vote on Account’. India has been the fastest-growing major economy for the third successive year. We are confident that India’s high growth is here to stay because of a renewed capex cycle, a well-capitalized banking system, robust credit growth, the surging housing sector, rising domestic consumption, robust investment, growing services exports, and “digitalization-driven productivity gains”. No big-bang measures are likely. But there could be an accent on fiscal prudence, greater capex, higher infrastructure allocation, and stress on PPP arrangements. Some pro-farmer measures, new initiatives to boost manufacturing, expansion of the PLI scheme, Make in India, ease of doing business, MSMEs, thrust on infrastructure, no income tax rebate, inclusion of a waiver of tax collected at source (TCS) on individual overseas credit and debit card expenditures up to Rs 7 lakh per year are likely. There could also be some measures relating to enhanced deduction under the individual policy and senior citizen, climate concern, green growth and ESG, and incentivizing start-ups.

The banking and finance sector could be given an impetus by greater integration of new technologies, attracting more foreign investments, enhancing digital skills, creating productive employment, providing additional incentives for women borrowers, support for smaller sectors like MSMEs and microfinance, stronger regulatory framework for fintech industry and higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios in identified areas. No major direct and indirect tax change is expected.

BK Bajaj, CEO, Infomerics Ratings and Valuation

The Budget 2024, despite being a ‘Vote on Account’, has aroused high expectations because India has emerged as a global growth driver and the widespread belief that the policies initiated by this government are likely to return to power.

Despite the constraints of a Vote on Account, we expect that the Government will continue with thrust on fiscal consolidation, easements of business and taxation laws, infrastructure, MSMEs, and financial inclusion. The Government could also focus on an expanded PLI (production linked incentive) scheme, to give a fillip to the manufacturing sector rural welfare with an emphasis on the farmer income transfer, housing for all. Policy changes aimed at encouraging innovation and streamlining regulatory frameworks would provide a fillip to the BFSI sector.

We expect a clear message that the process of reforms initiated in various sectors is here to stay and gain momentum. But while influencing the process and pattern of economic growth and structural transformation, there could be a sharper focus on the needs of the people at the bottom of the pyramid.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-no-big-bang-measures-likely-govts-priority-would-be-to-achieve-fiscal-discipline-say-economists-3379695/
financialexpress.com,Interim Budget 2024: Indian Railways eyes transformation with capital boost; aviation sector awaits key allocations,"In the upcoming interim budget on February 1, Indian Railways is expected to receive a significant boost in capital expenditure, signaling a potential transformation of the national transportation system. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman may allocate Rs 2.8-3 lakh crore to sustain the momentum of capital expenditure, compared to the Rs 2.4 lakh crore provided in the 2023-24 Budget Estimate.

In the 2023-24 fiscal year, the budgetary support was approximately Rs 1.6 lakh crore, with a capital allocation of around Rs 2.45 lakh crore. The gross budgetary support increased to Rs 2.4 lakh crore, while the total capital allocation reached Rs 2.6 lakh crore.

Analyst expectations and focus on modernisation

Analysts anticipate a substantial increase in capital expenditure, reflecting the government’s heightened focus on modernising railways. Credit rating agency ICRA states, “We expect adequate allocations towards the infrastructure sectors such as roads, highways, and railways in 2024-25.” The government’s emphasis on developing and producing emerging technologies in the defence sector may also result in enhanced outlays for research and development.



Elara Capital analysts noted the government’s prioritisation of capital spending, particularly in railways, roads, and defence. This emphasis is expected to persist, albeit at a moderate pace, reflecting the government’s commitment to infrastructure development.



Expectations from the aviation sector

The aviation sector in India has experienced substantial growth, with the Ministry of Civil Aviation targeting a doubling of domestic air passenger traffic from 15 crore to 30 crore by 2030. The Union Budget 2023-24 included plans for the construction of fifty additional airports and heliports to enhance regional air connectivity.



Passenger traffic is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14 percent from FY 23-25. The share of passenger traffic at non-metro airports has increased from 32 percent in FY15 to 40 percent in FY23. The burgeoning middle and upper-middle class in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, coupled with a projected GDP growth of 6.5-7.0 percent, is anticipated to drive increased air travel.



Civil aviation players are hopeful for budgetary announcements that improve allocations for training institutes, address the gap between supply and demand, and provide tax relief on Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) for airline viability. Additionally, fiscal incentives for Research and Development (R&D) and manufacturing of Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) items in India under the Make in India campaign are anticipated.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/interim-budget-2024-indian-railways-eyes-transformation-with-capital-boost-aviation-sector-awaits-key-allocations-3380089/

financialexpress.com,Decoding AI sector’s Union Budget 2024 Wishlist for a Technological Renaissance,"By Sarvagya Mishra

India, with its colossal information technology workforce, a thriving research community, and a burgeoning technology ecosystem, stands poised at the forefront of global artificial intelligence (AI) development. The surging demand for Software as a Service (SaaS) products and services infused with AI has notably catapulted this sector into the spotlight. Recognizing the transformative potential of AI in reshaping economies, the government think-tank NITI Aayog took a crucial step by unveiling the National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence in 2018.

NITI Aayog, in its forward-looking approach, advocated the creation of Centres of Excellence (CoEs) to fortify AI development and stimulate application-based research. Fast forward five years, and AI has not only made its presence felt across sectors but has secured a recurring mention in the Union Budget, the country’s most crucial financial document. In presenting the Union Budget 2023-24, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman articulated a vision to ‘Make AI in India and Make AI work for India,’ signalling a commitment to harnessing AI’s potential for technological renaissance.

While the Indian government is actively promoting AI, positioning the nation as a powerhouse in AI and analytics, challenges persist on the path to the widespread adoption of AI solutions. These hurdles necessitate a strategic approach, and industry stakeholders are eagerly anticipating more robust policies and measures in the upcoming Union Budget 2024-25. The potential impact is substantial, with the sector holding the key to boosting the national growth rate by 1.3% and adding a staggering $957 billion to India’s economy by 2035. Here’s what the AI sector demands from the union budget 2024:



Diversifying AI Applications

While the previous budget focused on augmenting AI deployment in key sectors like agriculture, healthcare and sustainable cities, stakeholders in the industry urge its expansion into other areas such as telecommunications. AI-powered voice agents, for instance, have proven transformative for multiple sectors, enhancing efficiency and user experience. Incentivizing broader application spectrum could amplify AI’s impact, catalyzing overall economic growth.



Ethical Regulation Framework

AI holds the promise to revolutionize tech development, but it also carries the potential to unsettle established norms or processes. Consequently, legislation must proactively keep pace with technology to ensure that the solutions AI platforms build are ethical. The Union Budget therefore should advocate for a “state-control” strategy in AI regulation, emphasizing the government’s active involvement in AI development and deployment. This proactive approach will uphold safety, ensure responsible use, and align the progression of technology with the nation’s strategic objectives.

Budgetary Support for AI Upskilling Programs

As per an industry report, India faces a demand to upskill or reskill 1.62 crore workers in AI and automation to address the prevailing skill deficit. In addition, the country necessitates the creation of 4.7 million new jobs in the technology sector alone, aiming to enhance the proficiency of the existing IT workforce comprising 4.6 million professionals by 2027. Acknowledging the critical requirement for a skilled AI workforce, the industry calls for budgetary support to facilitate comprehensive AI-focused upskilling programs, emphasizing the necessity for a future-ready workforce.

Investment in Emerging Frontiers

Industry leaders advocate increased investments in AI, particularly in emerging frontiers like quantum computing, digital nudges for societal well-being, and Explainable AI (XAI). Strategic funding in these cutting-edge technologies can catalyze entrepreneurial ventures, fostering an environment for groundbreaking advancements in AI. This positions India at the forefront of technological innovation, contributing to global AI leadership.



Catalyzing Startup Funding for AI

India’s tech startup ecosystem faced a funding slowdown in 2023, witnessing a 72 percent drop compared to 2022. To revitalize the AI startup landscape, the budget should prioritize ease of investing and catalyze a robust funding scenario. This will further invigorate the entrepreneurial spirit, encouraging innovation and bolstering India’s position in the global AI arena.

Conclusion

Artificial Intelligence holds great promise for India, presenting an opportunity to boost productivity, streamline costs and enhance citizens’ quality of life. While the government’s dedication to AI is on the rise, challenges persist on the path to large-scale AI deployment and the establishment of a common framework. The Union Budget 2024 stands as another promising gateway for the government to chart a comprehensive course for the future of AI in India. Considering the potential for the Indian AI market to reach US$ 3,935.5 Million by 2028, a forward-thinking AI-friendly budget can usher in a revolution, propelling the nation towards enduring growth and innovation in the technology sector.

Expert Expectation on Fintech from Interim Budget 2024

""With the Union Budget 2024 on the horizon, we highly appreciate the great job the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has done in bringing in regulations to govern fintechs. While the regulatory framework sets a strong foundation, we believe that the journey ahead could be enriched by more targeted fiscal measures and strategic incentives. The implementation of such measures would not only accelerate the growth of fintech startups but also fortify economic resilience and foster a culture of continuous innovation. Certain measures must be addressed to incentivise startups which are working for last-mile empowerment and enabling essential financial and digital services for citizens. Even a nominal GST subsidy would greatly expand the accessibility of financial services, spurring innovation in the fintech space.

Furthermore, we applaud the government's commitment to bolstering cybersecurity measures and enhancing IT infrastructure, as exemplified by the Telecom Bill. The introduction of the DPDP Act is a crucial step toward managing and safeguarding personal data in an increasingly interconnected digital world. As we steer through this landscape, we expect supplementary initiatives and safeguards that will further fortify the existing framework, ensuring strong data protection. Also, the recent announcement by the RBI to establish a fintech repository demonstrates a commitment to responsible lending, fair practices, and customer protection in the digital lending sphere. As we wait for the upcoming 2024 Union Budget, we are keen to see how it encourages critical aspects such as innovation, risk management, and compliance. A comprehensive budget that aligns with the evolving needs of the fintech sector will undoubtedly play an important role in shaping the future of financial technology in India,"" said Tashwinder Singh, CEO and Managing Director, Niyogin Fintech.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/market/share-market-budget-2024-expectations-live-top-stocks-to-watch-2-3378320/
financialexpress.com,Interim Budget 2024: What senior citizens expect from Nirmala Sitharaman,"Like the salaried taxpayers and the common man, senior citizens are also looking towards the Budget 2024 with much hope as high inflation and the rising cost of living amid limited income have made their life difficult. It may be noted that most senior citizens depend on fixed income investments or rental income to meet their regular income needs, and therefore require greater financial support and handholding than any other age group.

Income tax experts, however, say that the Union Budget 2024 is a Vote on Account and senior citizens should not anticipate any major announcements as a full-fledged budget will be presented upon the formation of the new government.

Still, like always, senior citizens have many expectations from the government and FM Nirmala Sitharaman. Here we take a look at some of them:

“Under the old tax regime, individuals of 60 years or older (i.e., senior citizens) are exempt from tax for income up to Rs 3,00,000, whereas the enhanced basic exemption limit for individuals of 80 years of age or older (i.e., super-senior citizens) is Rs 5,00,000. Since the aforementioned limits has not been increased since a long time, it should be modified in tune with inflation and the cost of living,” says Dr. Suresh Surana, Founder, RSM India.

Further, considering the healthcare needs of senior citizens as well as recognizing the rising healthcare costs for the elderly, the deduction limit u/s 80D of the I-T Act, which is available under the old tax regime, should be enhanced from the existing Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000.



“Senior citizens are also hoping for an increase in the tax exemption limits under the old and the new tax regime, tax-free pensions from NPS, EPS, etc. Increase in the deduction amount u/s 80TTB from the current Rs 50,000 for interest from savings bank account and fixed deposits is also on their wishlist,” says Akhil Chandna, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat.

Rationalisation of Section 194P wherein age limit for senior citizens to be exempt from filing income tax return over 75 years should be extended to all senior citizens.

Santosh Joseph, Founder and CEO, Germinate Investor Services, says that the present budget is going to be a vote on account budget, which means that since we are getting into the general assembly elections, this budget will be presented which will further be ratified by the new government which will be formed post the elections. Therefore, there will not be any big-bang announcements or reforms because if the government is going to be different, then these things will not get passed. Therefore, it usually will be very quiet or a muted budget to begin with.

However, as far as senior citizens are concerned, every year senior citizens look out for the budget for a couple of things:

1. Are there any new benefits/schemes by the Central government to reduce their taxes? “Considering most senior citizens do not have an active source of income, they would like their income to be tax-efficient or, if possible, to a great extent tax-free. In the past, the government has been very cognizant of this and that is why you have a senior citizen’s saving scheme, but what they really like is as much as possible a tax-free income,” informs Joseph.

2. Senior citizens would also like schemes that give them stability, income and some bit of growth in their investment which are also safe and guaranteed. We have a large population in India, which are senior citizens and are largely dependent on government schemes to park their retirement corpus in. Therefore, a Central government-backed scheme is a great choice and option for them to park their money.

3. A lot of senior citizens also look forward to relaxation in tax filing, relaxation in some of the fees and timelines applicable to general people. Already, if you are above 60, you get a discount in air fare and railway. So, they look at small benefits like these that can help them make things a lot more affordable. It could be travel, food, some of the deadlines and timelines they have.

So, “senior citizens are looking forward to things that make them comfortable especially in a fast-paced world we live in today — may be an extension of a deadline, or different timeline or different provisions for them from the income tax deduction, filing or even rebates,” says Joseph.

Whatever be the case, the aforementioned announcements, if introduced by the government, would provide senior citizens with more disposable income amidst rising inflation.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/interim-budget-2024-what-senior-citizens-expect-from-nirmala-sitharaman-3378792/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: MSME expectations centre around better access to credit, support in tech adoption, EODB","Union Budget 2024-2025: Better access to affordable credit remains the centre point of expectations from MSMEs for the upcoming budget to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1. Through various means such as TReDS, more credit schemes and enhanced fund allocation to existing schemes, MSME stakeholders have urged the government to take the support offered to MSMEs to the next level as the MSME Ministry aims to bring more MSMEs into the formal economic fold and extend credit support under priority sector lending.

Revise TReDS criterion, change in NPA classification norms

FICCI: Currently it is mandatory for all CPSEs and companies having annual turnover of more than Rs 500 crore to register on TReDS platform. It is suggested that registration should be mandatory for all companies having the turnover of more than Rs 250 crore as it would increase the purview of TReDS.

Currently, legal and compliance issues are preventing joint and corporate accounts from the scope of Account Aggregator (AA), thereby excluding a vital market segment of MSMEs from benefiting from AA. A concerted effort led by the Ministry of Finance and regulators would help address this issue.



Moreover, it is recommended that the 90 days limit for classifying overdue of MSMEs should be increased to 180 days so that MSMEs are not constrained to divert their working capital towards servicing of their loan instalments and clearing of their overdues at the cost of normal business operations. This improvement will save a large number of MSMEs from turning sick or getting closed resulting in loss of economic activity and employment.



Incentive for technology adoption

Akhand Jyoti Tiwari, Partner, MicroSave Consulting (MSC): Budgets may provide incentives and subsidies for MSMEs to adopt emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, cloud computing, and blockchain, which can enhance their productivity, efficiency, quality, and innovation. This will help MSMEs/entrepreneurs to compete in the global market and leverage the opportunities of Industry 5.0.

The budget shall encourage innovations in financing to startups/MSMEs by lenders; this may include incentives to innovate alternative financing options such as crowdfunding, invoice discounting, and supply chain financing. Collaborations with other stakeholders, such as industry associations, corporations, and government agencies, to share and optimize the resources and facilities available for MSME will boost compliance and access to market opportunities.

ECLGS-like schemes

Ramaswamy Iyer, Founder and CEO, Vayana: There is a pressing need to have programs similar to ECLGS, to assist MSMEs and ease their liquidity position. Since MSMEs usually operate on thin margins and stretched working capital, such schemes facilitate lower interest rates due to credit guarantee and reduce the interest burden.

In the realm of global outreach, facilitating cross-border trade finance is imperative to achieve India’s ambitious export targets set at $2 trillion by 2030. Necessary amendments are required, especially to the Negotiable Instruments Act, which will allow MSMEs to access formal and affordable credit using digital negotiable instruments, thereby fostering their active participation in international trade.

Increasing fund allocation for schemes

Rohit Mali, Director, Firefly Fire Pumps: Increasing the allocation of funds for schemes like Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance (RAMP), other schemes would provide major financial and technical support to MSMEs. Also, continuing support for the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) in vital sectors, expanding the scope of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), and investigating alternative financing avenues holds the potential to address the credit gap for MSMEs.

This, along with targeted fiscal incentives for technology upgrades, digital solutions, and capacity building, can boost them towards cleaner materials and sustainable manufacturing practices. Through tax breaks and R&D grants, MSMEs possess the capacity to make substantial contributions to India’s GDP, facilitate job creation, lead in environmental leadership, and drive innovation.

In the past year, the residential real estate market showcased remarkable growth, reaching historic highs in both home sales and new launches.

However, the industry’s current wishlist, featuring calls for industry status and single-window clearance, will feature this year as well.

Budget 2024 Stocks to Focus: Union Budget 2024 Impact on Share Market Today

Apart from these, “the industry expects substantial changes, particularly in the domain of boosting consumer sentiment. Raising the maximum deduction for home loans under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act from Rs 2 lakh to at least Rs 5 lakh is crucial. This adjustment has the potential to reinvigorate the housing market,” says Amrita Gupta, Director of the Manglam Group and Founder President of CREDAI Rajasthan Women’s Wing.

“As we shape the economic landscape, let’s not overlook the importance of gender-sensitive and sustainable policies that not only fortify our economy but also empower women to thrive in a positive environment. With a commitment to align with the September 2023 Delhi Declaration under the G20 India presidency, the anticipation is for a substantial 30% year-on-year increase in gender budgeting. At the same time, the government should focus on building a long term plan for a sustainable future,” adds Gupta.



India’s housing market showed impressive growth in 2023, overcoming challenges like rising property prices and the highest interest rates in six years. Despite these obstacles, the demand for real estate, particularly in the luxury and second home categories, remained robust.

“We anticipate that the 2024 Budget will favour homebuyers, supporting the sector’s ongoing growth. The recent focus on affordable housing is expected to continue even in the coming fiscal year. To sustain the positive trend observed in the market last year, the government can introduce measures such as providing maximum deductions for home loans and ensuring a stable interest rate environment. Now that inflation is under control, we hope that repo rates will remain consistent this year. This would significantly enhance prospects for both residential and commercial real estate markets, establishing a favourable setting for sustained sectoral growth,” says Aditya Khushwaha, CEO & Director, Axis Ecorp.

There is also an urge from the government to give a further boost to affordable housing.

Jetaish Gupta, Co-founder and Director of Adore Group, says, “In this budget the government should take a closer look at the affordable housing segment. A sunrise segment of the realty market, the category suffered a decline in sales during the pandemic. Currently, it comprises just 20% of the total housing sales, a marked difference from pre-pandemic days, when it accounted for 40% of sales. Through carefully curated policy impetus, tax breaks, and fiscal support, governing agencies need to help the sector revive, as it will be instrumental in bridging the widening housing gap.”

Gurmit Singh Arora, National President, Indian Plumbing Association, says, “No doubt real estate is on a strong footing and the segment is poised to grow vigorously in 2024. However, regulatory bodies and governments also need to play a pivotal role by integrating affordability and long-term sustainability. Indian urban centers still suffer from acute housing shortage and reports have suggested that by 2030, India needs an additional 25 million homes to bridge the gap. However, the government needs to take proactive steps in this regard. Besides lowering the lending rates in the affordable segment, the definition of affordability should be tweaked so that a greater number of households can come under its ambit. Developers should also be incentivized via better funding options, tax discounts, and R&D support. This will make the category sustainable in the long run.”

India’s real estate has grown steadily and the government needs to offer policy impetus and support to further give a buying boost to the industry. The sector plays a critical role in the economy and contributes to around 8% of the GDP. It is also the second biggest employment generator after the agriculture industry and more than 200 ancillary industries rely on it.

“Hence, the government should take proactive steps to boost the demand, rationalize the cost, and reduce the regulatory bottlenecks. In the coming budget, the governing agencies should look into giving real estate the industry status which is long due alongside mulling over single window clearance, tax breaks, and GST rationalization. This would not just be beneficial for the realty industry but the positive impacts will cascade into other related industries,” says LC Mittal, Director, Motia Group.

The Indian real estate sector peaked in 2023 with sales close to 5,00,000 in major cities, growing Y/Y by 31%. The bullish sentiments in the market will further continue in 2024 backed by a healthy macroeconomic outlook, stable lending rates, and an upbeat job market.

“So, the government should also bolster growth through prudent initiatives. One of them could be increasing the tax rebate on home loan interest payment to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 2 lakh. This will attract genuine homebuyers and boost the demand. Likewise, it should look into other parameters such as reducing the repo rates, offering tax holidays to developers, and finding other alternative sources of project funding,” suggests Anurag Goel, Director, Goel Ganga Developments.

The government also need to take a close look at both supply sides and demand drivers to help the sector grow further and mitigate any potential risk.

Aman Gupta, Director, RPS Group, says, “To boost demand, it should think about increasing the tax rebate on home loan interest, reducing the capital gain tax, and further lowering interest rates for the EWS segments. Similarly, to strengthen the demand side, it should create alternative funds, free land banks for new developments, rationalize the GST tax regime, etc. GOI should also promote green and sustainable real estate. Green realty can become mainstream only when there are concentrated efforts to support innovations and faster adoption of technologies.”

Hari Kishan Movva, Senior Vice President, SILA, says, “To stimulate the housing market, it’s crucial to increase the Section 24’s home loan interest rate rebate from Rs 2 lakh to at least Rs 5 lakh. This adjustment could particularly benefit budget homes, facing a 20% decline in sales in 2023 due to the pandemic. Reviving expired incentives, like tax breaks, is imperative for affordable housing. Modify eligibility criteria, considering the Ministry’s definition based on income, property size, and price. Adjust the qualifying cost for city properties; for instance, raise the budget to Rs 85 lakh for Mumbai. This ensures broader accessibility and utilization of government subsidies and reduced GST rates.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-real-estate-seeks-affordable-housing-push-sops-for-homebuyers-3378627/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Chemical industry looking for tax reforms and tech support,"On the eve of the Union Budget 2024, the chemical industry has sought tax reforms and technological support in order to maintain sustainable growth. Furthermore, in the wake of the geo-political crisis in Europe and Middle East, the industry wish-list also includes relief in the freight services through the Red Sea and anti-dumping measures to prevent countries like China, Korea and Thailand from pouring Indian markets with their cheaper products.

Abhay V Udeshi, Chairman, of CHEMEXCIL (Basic Chemicals, Cosmetics and dyes Export Promotion Council), said, “For the Budget 2024, the government should consider about the RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products) Scheme, challenges in freight services due to the instability in the Red Sea and some tax exemptions for the investments in research and development.”





He said, “The RoDTEP Scheme provides for a flat 0.8% exemption rate for the chemical exporters but the industry needs the rates to range between 1% to 5% depending on different criteria because the flat rate is reducing the export competitiveness of Indian manufacturers. Apart from that, seeing worsening conditions around the Red Sea, the government should also provide some freight support packages to help the industry in dealing with increasing freight rates.”

The RoDTEP Scheme came into effect from January 1, 2021. The scheme ensures that the exporters receive the refunds on the embedded taxes and duties so that Indian manufacturers can compete with international players and boost their exports. Stressing on the need to provide additional technological support, Jaimin Vasa, Chairman, Gujarat Chemical Association, claimed that due to lack of technological know-how and new tech developments in the sector, India is not in a position to eliminate import dependency on China and other countries.

He also said, “Because of the poor performance in the Textile Sector, domestic chemical demand has been impacted. Furthermore, the geo-political instabilities across the globe are hampering the global demand. Our lack of advanced technology forces Indian manufacturers to buy costlier raw materials which makes our products more costly.”

Vasa, who is also the Chairman of Vasa Pharmachem Private limited, further told FE, “If we want reach the market size of $ 300 billion by the end of 2025 from its current size of $ 220 billion, we need to ensure the availability of competitive finance and easy access to commercial service centers for the MSMEs in the sector. In order to achieve sustainable growth in the chemical sector, it is necessary that the MSMEs contribute at least 40% of the industry.”



Maulik Patel, CMD, Epigral Limited, said, “India is among the very few markets which have a robust internal demand and we need to revisit the Free Trade Agreements with other countries because current FTAs are making Indian manufacturers less competitive in the global market. Countries like Thailand are dumping their products in India at 0% duty while we have to pay a duty of around 6.5% when we export to other countries.

Additionally, this difference also impacts the incoming FDIs in the chemical sector as the investors choose to invest in more technologically advanced countries like Thailand because they can also have access to Indian markets without bearing any extra cost”, added Patel.

Commenting on the elimination of import dependency in the chemical sector, Patel said, “The rate of demand growth in the Indian chemical market is more than the rate of supply growth which means that the demand in India is always going to be larger than the supply and we will always be dependent on imports. China captures around 50% of the global market compared to India’s share of 3% – 4%.

This also indicates that the whole world is going to be dependent on China for chemicals for the foreseeable future. But, it should be noted that after the Covid pandemic, the whole world is looking for a second manufacturing hub other than China and India have all the capabilities to become that option.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-chemical-industry-looking-for-tax-reforms-and-tech-support-3378082/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Will Standard Deduction limit be increased in this year’s interim budget?,"Among the many expectations of the salaried class from this year’s interim budget, one key expectation is the increase in the standard deduction limit to provide them with more disposable income.

It may be noted that standard deduction is a fixed deduction available to salaried individuals without the need for providing evidence of actual expenses incurred. Section 16(ia) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 allows salaried individuals filing their return of income under the old tax regime to claim a flat standard deduction of Rs 50,000 against their salary. The Finance Act 2023 extended such benefit to salaried individuals opting for the concessional tax regime u/s 115BAC of the I-T Act.

Budget 2024 Income Tax Live Updates: Income Tax Slab Rate Change Budget 2024 Live Updates

Budget 2024 Stocks to Focus: Union Budget 2024 Impact on Share Market Today

Historically, this deduction was available for many years, but in 2005, this was removed only to be reintroduced in the 2018 Union Budget. Although the standard deduction was initially set at Rs 40,000 in the Union Budget 2018, it was later increased to Rs 50,000 in the Budget 2019. However, the increased limit of Rs 50,000 was limited to the old tax regime. The Union Budget 2023, in a bid to make the new tax regime more attractive, allowed standard deduction of Rs 50,000 to taxpayers opting for the new regime as well.



The current deduction of Rs 50,000, however, is deemed insufficient to cover the escalating costs and expenses associated with the higher standard of living and, thus, there is a need to increase the limit of this deduction.

“This adjustment would also bring parity with individuals earning income from business or profession, who can claim actual expenses or opt for a presumptive basis of taxation, where a certain percentage of gross income is considered as an expense. Moreover, post the pandemic, there has been an increase in medical costs, which should be factored in when considering an increase in the standard deduction. To address these concerns, the government could consider increasing the standard deduction to Rs 100,000,” says Divya Baweja, Partner with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP.

“The standard deduction was re-introduced by government in financial year 2018-19 with an amount of Rs 40,000 and enhanced to Rs 50,000 from financial year 2019-20. The benefit of standard deduction has been made available to the salaried individuals opting for concessional tax regime with effect from financial year 2023-24. Given the year-on-year inflation and rise in cost of living, the government may consider increasing the standard deduction to Rs 1,00,000,” informs Shuddhasattwa Ghosh, Tax Partner, EY India.

Dr. Suresh Surana, Founder, RSM India, has similar views. He says, “Considering the said limit of standard deduction was last revised in 2019 (i.e. increased from Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 50,000) and the current inflation rates, it would be fair to increase the said limit from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1,00,000. Alternatively, such standard deduction may be linked to the Cost Inflation Index similar to manner for computing the indexed cost of acquisition for capital gains.”

Tax experts say that in the Union Budget 2023 the government had made it very clear that the new scheme of taxation would be the scheme for the future. Hence going forward, there would be no deduction on the investments which are now available u/s 80C.

“However, a special carve out was made for standard deduction, which was introduced in the new scheme also in addition to the old scheme. Conceptually, standard deduction is supposed to take care of expenses which are not allowed as deduction under income tax rules. No bills are required to be produced for claiming standard deduction. However, the standard deduction has been kept as Rs 50,000 since the last 5 years. Considering an inflation of 5%-6% yearly, the standard deduction should be enchanced to Rs 65,000 at least in this Union Budget 2024,” says Vivek Jalan, Partner, Tax Connect Advisory.

Whatever be the case, there is no denying the fact that there is a solid case for the raise in the standard deduction limit, and it is hoped that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will pay heed to this genuine demand of the salaried class sooner or later.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-will-standard-deduction-limit-be-increased-in-this-years-interim-budget-3378005/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Indian students studying abroad await good news from FM,"Union Budget 2024: Indian students studying abroad eagerly await the interim Budget 2024-25 to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Lok Sabha on February 1. Indian parents sending money abroad for their children’s education must follow RBI’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme rules, which limit remittances to USD 250,000 per financial year.

Further, remittances abroad are subject to Tax Collected at Source (TCS) rules. From October 1, 2023, rules require authorized dealers, banks, and money changers to levy a Tax Collected at Source (TCS) on funds transmitted overseas for certain defined purposes including overseas travel, investment, medical needs, and international education.

“A reduction or waiver in Tax Collected at Source (TCS) while remitting money for overseas education and ancillary activities will be a welcome sign. Lowering or waiving off TCS while remitting funds overseas for education will ease the burden on families and encourage more students to explore educational opportunities at a destination of their choice,” says Saurabh Arora, CEO, University Living.









TCS Calculation on Overseas Education Remittance

If the total remittance for foreign education in one financial year is up to Rs 7 lakh, there is no implication of TCS, whether it is from your sources like a bank account or if you have availed an education loan. In the scenario when the remittance amount is less than Rs 7 lakhs, no TCS will be levied, resulting in a 0% TCS rate and no tax liability.

However, if the amount of remittance exceeds Rs 7 lakh, then the TCS rules differ. The remittances exceeding Rs 7 lakh in a year is subject to TCS at a rate of 0.5% if the education is being funded by a loan from a financial institution (as defined in Section 80E of the Income Tax Act ) and 5% if no loan is being used to support the remittances. The incidence of tax of 0.5% or 5%, will be only on the amount exceeding Rs 7 lakh.

However, there’s a finer point to be noted in TCS. “Maintenance of close relatives” attracts a 20% TCS once your international payments exceed Rs 7 lakh in a fiscal year. When sending money to students in the “maintenance of close relative” category, their parents or guardians only need to provide paperwork demonstrating the remittance is for a student studying abroad. If that link is established, this category will only accept Overseas Education’s concessional TCS rates (0.5% / 5%).

Further, expenditures made on foreign credit cards do not invite TCS now. An Indian student traveling overseas can use an international credit card to cover the costs.

Raghwa Gopal, CEO of MSM Global: a Canada-based education and ed-tech company says, “The Tax Collected at Source (TCS) rate, which affects students studying abroad, is expected to be addressed in the budget. Focusing on lowering TCS rates could help these students who are struggling financially.

The budget may include measures to mitigate the impact of TCS on remittances for education-related expenses. Facilitating options such as zero forex international cards that are exempt from TCS up to Rs. 7 lakhs annually are included in this. The budget could provide direction to parents who are sending money overseas for their kids’ education, emphasizing responsible financial decisions to lessen the effects of TCS on tuition and travel costs.”

The Union Finance Ministry clarified the taxation of international payments made by students using their international debit or credit cards. To provide financial respite to students studying abroad, the ministry announced that payments of up to Rs 7 lakh per financial year would be exempt from the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) limits.

For loans that qualify for the Section 80E tax benefit

Loan amount up to Rs 7 lakh: No TCS

Loan amount exceeding Rs 7 lakh: TCS of 0.5%

For remittances not out of loan (self-funded)

Loan amount up to Rs 7 lakh: TCS of 5%

Budget 2024 Expectations Live: 'Industry anticipates continuation of incentives for affordable rental housing schemes'

Sandeep Runwal, President, NAREDCO Maharashtra

The real estate industry, a vital contributor to the economy and the second-largest employment generator, is poised on the brink of potentially transformative changes. The sector eagerly anticipates the 2024-25 budget announcements, which are expected to significantly influence its future.

In the previous year, the Central and State governments implemented a series of reforms and incentives to rejuvenate the economy. These efforts have been instrumental in sustaining the growth momentum of the real estate sector.

A major focal point for the Government continues to be affordable housing. We suggest an increase in the cap for interest rate deduction under section 24(b) from Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh per annum. Additionally, there's a call to redefine the definition of affordable housing, proposing an increase in the cap from Rs. 45 lakh to Rs. 1 crore, particularly in metro cities. This change is expected to significantly boost both affordable and mid-segment housing.

The industry also anticipates the continuation of incentives for affordable rental housing schemes. Tax reliefs for such projects could accelerate investment and aid in achieving the Government's ambitious 'Housing for All' goal. Further expectations include tax benefits for first-time homebuyers and the re-introduction of GST with an input tax credit on under-construction properties. These measures are anticipated to stimulate demand among homebuyers.

Other suggestions include tax reliefs to fuel significant growth in the real estate sector, single window clearance, and reduced home loan interest rates. The reintroduction of subvention schemes is also on the wish list, which would assist homebuyers in aligning their payments and encourage home buying decisions.

There's a call for an increase in the SWAMIH stress fund and the creation of a second tranche with a corpus of ₹50,000, aimed at completing stalled realty projects and ensuring adequate liquidity.

A long-standing demand of the sector has been the granting of ‘industry status’ to real estate. This year, there is a hopeful anticipation that the Government will address this issue.

In summary, the real estate sector expects the Government to take decisive actions in the upcoming budget to fortify not only the real estate market but the entire economy. These measures should aim at addressing critical issues, ensuring job creation, and sustaining growth momentum.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/interim-budget-2024-live-updates-interim-budget-expectations-railways-infrastructure-income-tax-slabs-education-jobs-nirmala-sitharamana-3377234/

The industry looks forward to proactive steps from the government to stimulate growth and contribute to the nation’s economic development.

Expectations are high for the upcoming Union Budget 2024, with the developer community outlining its wishlist for government consideration.

Budget 2024 Stocks to Focus: Union Budget 2024 Impact on Share Market Today

Ramesh Ranganathan, CEO, K Raheja Corp Homes said, “elevating the Real Estate sector to industry status is key. We anticipate impactful policies, fostering industry growth with tax incentives measures making it more lucrative for homebuyers. The holding period for residential properties as a long-term capital asset should be shortened to 12 months, aligning with market dynamics.”

“In line with the government’s ‘housing for all’ focus, boosting home purchases through elevated tax deductions both for developers and buyers is crucial, making home ownership more affordable and enticing,” Ranganathan added.

Ashok Singh Jaunapuria, MD & CEO, SS Group, said “as we stand at the threshold of the dawn of a new financial year, we are eagerly awaiting the release of the Union Budget 2024-25.”

“With the Indian real estate peaking in 2023, we are confident that this buoyant trend will continue well into 2024 as well in the backdrop of a healthy macroeconomic outlook, an uptick in the job market and stable lending rates. This year could be the year of reckoning if the government can focus on the affordable housing segment. Through carefully curated policy impetus, fiscal support, the government should look at giving a boost to this segment which will bridge the widening housing gap,” Jaunapuria added.

He also mentioned that “another important element we are seeking from the Union budget 2024 is to increase the home loan interest rebate from the existing Rs.2 lakh to Rs.5 lakh. This will attract genuine home buyers and boost demand.” “Finally, a single-window clearance to reduce roadblock and speed up projects together with RERA amendments will be a great boon,” he said.

“We anticipate a growth-oriented budget that positions real estate as a driver of progress, fostering sustainable development, incentivizing innovation, and supporting the housing segment with significant tax breaks. The industry flourished in 2023, and we hope the Union Budget includes provisions for a single window clearance system to enhance transparency and efficiency. Granting ‘Industry’ status to the real estate sector is also a long-awaited demand,” says Santosh Agarwal, Executive Director and CFO, Alphacorp.

Despite global economic uncertainties, the sector has displayed remarkable resilience and is poised for growth through favorable government policies.

S K Narvar, Group Chairman, Trident Realty, is optimistic about impactful measures in the upcoming Union Budget. He suggests, “The budget should include fiscal stimulus and personal tax relief, such as increasing the tax rebate on home loan interest rates from Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh. This would significantly benefit millions of first-time homebuyers. Additionally, the government should continue focusing on Tier 2 & Tier 3 cities, providing more infra-development funds to benefit a larger number of projects in these areas. Revising the definition of affordable housing, both in terms of value and size, would cater to the population returning to their hometowns and boost housing demand in new markets.”

The commercial realty segment, encompassing office and retail space, plays a crucial role in the sector’s growth. Hoping for strategic policy interventions, Aman Sharma, Managing Director and Founder of Aarize Group, emphasizes, “The 2024 Union Budget is eagerly awaited. Stable regulatory reforms that streamline approvals and permitting processes, reducing delays in project execution, could further fuel the momentum observed in the retail leasing sector, which surged by 65 percent in January-June 2023 according to CBRE South Asia.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-will-real-estate-sector-get-the-industry-status-take-a-look-at-what-realtors-expecting-3377392/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations for a robust and transparent real estate industry,"As the government gears up to present the Union Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, the real estate sector stands at the forefront of expectations, anticipating transformative policy measures to propel its growth and ensure transparency. Key stakeholders in the industry are rallying for strategic interventions to revive the sector, bridge the housing gap, and fortify the trajectory set by recent reforms.

The urgent need to address the housing gap has brought the affordable housing segment into sharp focus. Industry experts emphasize the importance of policy impetus, tax breaks, and fiscal support to revive this segment, ensuring that it becomes a cornerstone of the upcoming budget’s agenda. This concerted effort aims not only to provide homes for a larger section of society but also to stimulate economic activity in related industries.





Industry status, single-window clearance

A pivotal demand echoed by the real estate fraternity is the accord of industry status. This recognition would signify a paradigm shift, acknowledging the sector’s vital role in India’s economic development. Alongside this, the call for a single-window clearance mechanism gains prominence, streamlining regulatory processes and spurring a more conducive environment for project execution. Coupled with tax breaks and GST rationalization, these measures can create a ripple effect, positively impacting ancillary industries.



Enhancing home Loan interest rate rebates

To invigorate the housing market, experts advocate for a substantial increase in the Income Tax Act Section 24’s home loan interest rate rebate. Proposing an elevation from ₹2 lakh to at least ₹5 lakh, this measure aims to attract genuine homebuyers and boost demand. Simultaneously, considerations such as reducing repo rates, offering tax holidays to developers, and exploring alternative project funding sources are on the table for discussion.

SWAMIH Fund and beyond

The National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) has emerged as a vocal advocate for the industry’s interests. Their recommendations include the introduction of the second tranche of the Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) fund, allocating a corpus of ₹50,000 crore for the fiscal year 2024-2025. This injection of liquidity is envisioned as a catalyst for timely project completion, providing a much-needed boost to the sector.

Beyond the SWAMIH fund, NAREDCO has championed additional budgetary supports. This includes the push for input tax credit under GST, incentives for rental housing, and a strategic reduction in GST rates for real estate. Aligned with the overarching vision of achieving “housing for all,” these measures aim to create an ecosystem that fosters sustainable growth and widespread access to housing.

Real estate’s role in India’s economic ascent

As India strides toward a $5 trillion economy with the aim of becoming the third-largest GDP by 2027-28, the real estate sector anticipates the government’s initiatives to stimulate consumer demand in the property market. Acknowledged as a significant contributor to the Indian economy, the real estate industry underscores its optimistic outlook, expecting policy measures that align with the nation’s economic ambitions.

Real estate education platforms

Looking beyond policy interventions, the budget is anticipated to pave the way for real estate-focused education platforms. These platforms would cater to upskilling existing professionals and nurturing budding realtors. Initiatives encompassing skill development programs, soft skill training, and specialized courses for marketing professionals could find a place under these platforms. Such a move not only upgrades a significant job market but also motivates young Indians to join the real estate sector, fostering a skilled workforce.

RERA: A game-changer

Government interventions not only impact the financial dynamics of homebuying but also serve as a reinforcement of regulatory frameworks. Increased accountability and transparency are intrinsic to the government’s support for amendments to the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act. These changes play a pivotal role in shielding the industry from fraud and delays, fostering renewed trust in the real estate business, a sentiment steadily rising in recent years. RERA stands out as a game-changer for the industry. While it has effectively addressed myriad violations and improved sectoral functionality, there is a collective call for intensified execution to further elevate transparency.

Conclusively, the real estate sector’s wishlist for the Union Budget 2024-25 is comprehensive and strategic. It encompasses measures to stimulate demand, enhance transparency, and fortify the industry’s pivotal role in India’s economic landscape. As the government navigates these expectations, the real estate sector remains hopeful that the budget will provide the necessary impetus for its continued growth and development.

A critical question hangs in the air – will it be a tailwind, propelling startups to greater heights or a headwind testing their resilience?

Startups require a growth-friendly ecosystem. Scaled-back regulations, simpler compliance, and calibrated capital gains can unlock funding and propel early ventures. Seed funding for AI, healthcare, and cleantech can further spark innovation. Beyond finance, clarity in regulations and leveraging avenues for open dialogue with policymakers are vital. Investing in talent with digital dexterity will fuel sustained success.



Addressing key issues in taxation requires action on several fronts. One concern is the difference in tax rates for long-term capital gains, where publicly listed shares are taxed at 10 per cent and privately held unlisted ones at 20 per cent. The varying holding periods for these shares, one year for listed and two years for unlisted, add complexity to the tax system.

In the Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) community, there’s a significant concern about the tax on ‘carried interest’ or ‘carry,’ compensation for VC fund managers. Privately held companies, especially startups, selling shares at a premium to foreign investors may face extra taxes, affecting fundraising for local companies.

Lastly, extending ‘angel tax’ to transactions with foreign investors raises concerns. If excess premiums received by Indian unlisted companies are taxed, it could impact cross-border investments. These issues emphasize the need for well-thought-out policies to support startups and investors.

Tax Optimization and Carry-Forward Losses

Tax breaks and incentives have been the lifeblood of Indian startups. Extending the existing tax holiday and allowing the carry-forward of losses for a longer period can provide much-needed breathing space. This will ease the burden on young ventures, allowing them to reinvest profits in growth and attract talent.

Dedicated Funds for Sustainable Growth

Investing in the future requires a focus on sustainability. By creating dedicated funding channels for greentech, clean energy, and social impact ventures, the budget can fuel advancements in renewable energy, environmental protection, and social responsibility, propelling positive change across sectors and creating a thriving ecosystem for sustainable innovation. These funds, coupled with tax breaks for sustainable initiatives, can incentivize entrepreneurs to tackle climate change and create a more equitable future.

Tech Industry Incentives for Innovation

India’s tech prowess is undeniable, but it needs constant nurturing. This budget has the opportunity to offer targeted incentives for research and development in key areas like AI, blockchain, and cloud computing. This will encourage innovation, attract global tech giants and position India as a leader in the digital revolution.

AI-powered Transformation

It’s a given that AI is reshaping every industry today. Therefore, budget allocations should reflect this paradigm shift, providing grants and subsidies for startups developing AI solutions in healthcare, education, and agriculture. This will accelerate AI adoption, improve efficiency across sectors, and unlock new avenues for economic growth.

Enhancing Funding Opportunities

Access to capital remains a major hurdle for many startups. Investing in the future of India’s startup ecosystem, the budget might seek to implement tax breaks for angel investors and VCs, incentivize crowdfunding platforms, and establish a dedicated startup exchange to create a holistic funding infrastructure, ensuring startups have the resources needed to thrive and contribute to national prosperity. This will diversify funding options and make capital more accessible for young ventures.

Simplified GST Structure

The complexities of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) can be daunting for startups. Streamlining GST compliance for early-stage startups through fewer slabs, simplified reporting, and targeted exemptions can both ease their administrative burden and boost government revenue in the long term. This will also allow startups to focus on their core business.

Dedicated Startup Funds for Emerging Industries

Beyond the established tech and e-commerce sectors, India has a plethora of promising yet nascent industries, such as space tech, gaming and animation. The budget’s allocation of dedicated funding for emerging sectors, coupled with streamlined access and transparent guidelines, can provide vital financial support, attract talent, and propel the rapid growth of these promising industries.

Tech Industry Expectations

The tech industry expects the budget to address concerns around talent acquisition by promoting STEM education and reskilling programs. Additionally, streamlining data privacy regulations and fostering a collaborative environment between academia and startups can further propel India’s digital journey.

The budget is also critical for the not-for-profit startup enablers that provide young Indian entrepreneurs with the necessary support. These ecosystem enablers, sustain themselves independently and pose a crucial question: Can financially autonomous not-for-profits actively engage in the start-up ecosystem through investments? The influence of the budget becomes apparent as these entities pursue equity stakes in startups, striving to claim a portion of the profits. This dynamic challenges traditional perspectives and defines their role within the economic ecosystem.

India’s budget holds the key to unlocking start-up growth. Expect tax breaks, AI incentives and dedicated funds for green tech, propelling innovation and job creation. Simplified GST and accessible capital can breathe life into young ventures, transforming dreams into economic engines. The countdown is on, and the budget could define the startup landscape for years to come.

financialexpress.com,10 key expectations of real estate sector from Budget 2024,"As the sun sets on the fiscal horizon, casting shadows of anticipation and speculation, the real estate industry eagerly awaits the unveiling of the pre-budget landscape. In the intricate dance between policy and practice, the pre-budget phase becomes a crucial overture, setting the tempo for the real estate symphony that echoes through economic corridors.







Realty experts say the pre-budget expectations in the real estate sector are akin to seeds sown in fertile soil, where each policy pronouncement is poised to sprout into a forest of opportunities. Investors, developers, and homeowners alike stand on the precipice of fiscal revelation, hoping for a budget that not only addresses the challenges but also nurtures the growth of the real estate ecosystem.



The clamor for fiscal incentives, tax reforms, and regulatory frameworks harmonized with the evolving needs of the industry resonates within the corridors of real estate power. A pre-budget that espouses simplicity in procedures, transparency in transactions, and encouragement for sustainable practices becomes the catalyst for a robust and resilient real estate sector.

In the delicate balance of economic stewardship, the pre-budget stage becomes a canvas where the strokes of policy paint the picture of the industry’s future. Measures that stimulate demand, ease liquidity constraints, and foster innovation are the palette choices that can transform the real estate canvas into a masterpiece of economic resurgence.







“The real estate industry, with its far-reaching implications on employment, infrastructure, and economic vitality, yearns for a pre-budget that not only acknowledges its significance but propels it toward unprecedented heights. As the fiscal curtain rises, the real estate players look beyond numbers and percentages; they seek a narrative that encapsulates a vision for an industry that not only weathers storms but also builds bridges toward a prosperous future. In the pre-budget discourse, the real estate industry anticipates not just financial allocations but a commitment to shaping a landscape where dreams find a home, investments yield fruit, and the foundation for sustainable growth is laid. As the budgetary tapestry unfolds, the real estate sector stands poised at the brink of transformation, awaiting a pre-budget symphony that orchestrates harmony in the market and fortifies the pillars of economic resilience,” says Shiwang Suraj, Director & Founder, InfraMantra.

As the Union Budget 2024 is going to be presented soon, the expectations of both homebuyers and real estate developers are running high, although not much can be expected because this being an interim budget. Still, like every year, there are expectations galore and we are taking a look at the 10 key budget expectations of India’s real estate sector from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman:

1. Boost for Affordable Housing

While there is robust demand and increased borrowing activity in the luxury and high-end housing segment, there has been a noticeable downturn in the demand for home loans in the affordable housing sector. This decline can be linked to a range of factors, especially the scarcity of affordable housing projects. The rise in land and construction costs has made it challenging for developers to find the feasibility of launching projects in this segment.

“Additionally, the end of the government’s credit-linked subsidy scheme (CLSS) for this specific segment has further contributed to the decline in demand for home loans within the affordable housing category. In light of these circumstances, we strongly advocate for the reinstatement of the CLSS and the reintroduction of other incentives in the upcoming budget to revitalize support for the affordable housing sector. Additionally, we recommend an enhancement in deductions against home loans to further bolster the mid-segment housing category. By implementing these measures, the government can not only address the current challenges but also stimulate growth and affordability in the housing market,” says Raoul Kapoor, Co-CEO, Andromeda Sales and Distribution Pvt Ltd.

2. Modification in the Qualifying Standards for Affordable Housing

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation defines affordable housing as being determined by the buyer’s income, the size of the property, and its price. Affordable housing is defined as a house or apartment valued up to Rs 45 lakh, with a carpet area of up to 90 square metres, located in non-metropolitan cities and villages, and 60 square metres in large cities. The definition provided by the central bank, however, is based on the loans that banks provide to individuals so that they can purchase apartments or build houses.

The government needs to take a hard look at adjusting the qualifying cost of properties within cities’ affordable housing segment. Although the units’ defined size of 60 square metres is reasonable, the prices of up to Rs 45 lakh make them unaffordable to a huge share of the target clientele. For example, a budget of <Rs 45 lakh is irrelevant for a metropolis like Mumbai; it should be increased to at least Rs 85 lakh. The budget should be raised to at least Rs 60–65 lakh for other large cities. With this price adjustment, more homes will be within the reach of more buyers, who will be able to take advantage of other advantages such government subsidies, reduced GST rates at 1% without ITC, etc,” says Anuj Puri, Chairman, ANAROCK Group.

3. Increase in Deduction for Interest on Home Loan

Given the upward trajectory of property prices, there has been a substantial increase in borrowing amounts. Moreover, the surge in interest rates has led to higher Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) for homebuyers.

“In light of these challenges, we appeal to the Finance Minister to reconsider the existing deduction of Rs 2 lakh against home loan interest. Considering that the last adjustment was an increase of Rs 50,000 in 2014, we propose a minimum increase to Rs 4 lakh. Such a step would not only offer significant relief to potential homebuyers but also contribute to an overall economic upswing,” says Prashant Rao, Managing Director, Poulomi Estates, a Hyderabad-based real estate developer.

Additionally, “the real estate sector is anxiously awaiting several other reforms, including the industry status, a streamlined single-window system, and reduction in GST rates. These measures are crucial to supporting the demand for real estate from both end-users and investors. With the government’s collaboration in implementing these changes, the real estate sector is poised to experience more sustainable growth in the future,” he adds.

4. Separate Section for Home Loan Principal Repayment

Housing constitutes a fundamental necessity for individuals, and tax benefits need to be structured to support homebuyers effectively. In the forthcoming budget, developers anticipate key measures such as Single Window Clearance, Industry Status, and an augmented tax exemption for housing loans.

“It is imperative to introduce a dedicated section exclusively for the deduction against home loan principal repayment. The current section (80C) is saturated with various deduction avenues, and only a limited number of borrowers utilize this section for home loan deductions. Therefore, we strongly demand for the creation of a separate section for home loan principal repayment with a minimum limit set at Rs 2.5 lakh. Additionally, we propose raising the home loan interest deduction limit to Rs 5 lakh,” suggests Mohit Jain, Managing Director, Krisumi Corporation.

Furthermore, Jain emphasizes the importance of the Government’s continued focus on infrastructure development, given its multiplier effect on the economy at large. “The real estate sector, exemplified by the surge in the Gurugram real estate market, stands to benefit significantly from such initiatives,” he adds.

5. Incentivising Rental Housing

In addition to supporting homebuyers, the budget can also play a part in incentivizing rental housing for the low-income segment for many of whom, acquiring a home is simply not an option. There are houses in the sub-50 lakh ticket size that have been acquired as an investment but remain unoccupied as owners do not find it viable to rent out due to the low prevailing yields.

“The budget could introduce a 100% exemption for rental income up to Rs 3 lakh for houses costing up to Rs 50 lakh. This would incentivize investors to rent out properties and augment the supply of rental accommodation in the segment which is the most impacted by the housing shortage,” says Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director, Knight Frank India.

6. Making home purchases more tax-efficient

Under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act, long-term capital gains from sales of existing house can be utilized in buying or constructing a new property. If the investment for exemption is done through an under-construction property, it can be claimed only if the construction of the property is completed within three years of sale of the earlier house.

“Residential projects are continuously increasing in scale in terms of number of units, height and amenities which causes them to have completion timelines in excess of three years. Also, while the implementation of RERA has caused an improvement, the completion timelines of under-construction projects frequently exceed deadlines. This causes significant hinderances to homebuyers in setting-off capital gains in under-construction properties. To mitigate this, we recommend that the completion timeline of under-construction properties be extended to five years instead of the existing three,” says Baijal.

7. Grant of Industry Status

One of the primary expectations of the real estate sector from the interim budget is the grant of industry status.

“RERA is being implemented across the sector quite sincerely, and developers are becoming more vigilant and responsible. Hence, the status of the industry would help in availing better financing. The construction industry is a significant employer, especially with a considerable portion being unskilled and casual labourers. So, conferring the industry status would catalyse growth. It aligns with the national vision of providing housing for all and generating employment. Anticipated measures also include implementing a single window clearance system and a focus on promoting affordable housing,” says Mohit Goel, MD, Omaxe Group.

8. Single Window Clearance System

If the Interim Budget 2024-24 provides a single window clearance platform to the realty sector, that may fast-track project development and improve customer confidence while reducing uncertainties around approvals and litigations. It will also reduce the compliance and approval costs for the developers.

Dr. Dharmesh Shah, CEO, Hero Realty Pvt Ltd, says, “The real estate industry’s outlook for 2024 remains positive after the top seven cities saw record-breaking sales of 4.77 lakh housing units, but the upcoming general elections may impact demand and growth in residential real estate. To continue the buoyancy, an industry status for the housing sector, a single-window clearance system for housing projects, and an increase in the tax rebate under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act to at least Rs 4 lakh is the necessity.”

9. Stamp Duty Concessions

Offering concessions in stamp duty rates or allowing twice the duty paid as expenditure under income tax could incentivize more agreements to be registered, facilitating smoother property transactions. “It’s worth noting that during the pandemic, the Government of Maharashtra had reduced the stamp duty to 2-3% of the property value, which had driven more people to buy properties,” says Saurabh Garg, Co-founder & Chief Business Officer, NoBroker.com.

10. Simplification of Taxation on REIT

The Finance Minister should also introduce tax incentives under Section 80C for investors in real estate investment trusts (REITs). This would enable REITs to emerge as an attractive tax-saving instrument, further encouraging prospective investors.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/10-key-expectations-of-real-estate-sector-from-budget-2024-3375930/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: Here’s what real estate expects from Nirmala Sitharaman,"The real estate sector, buoyed by a remarkable year, has again started looking towards the upcoming Interim Budget 2024-2025 with a blend of hope and expectations. The previous year, as detailed in various reports, was a milestone for residential real estate, witnessing an upsurge in both new launches and home sales. This success story has set the stage for what many in the industry hope will be a transformative period of policy reform.









Highlighting the sector’s critical role in India’s overall economic framework, Kunal Rishi, COO, Paras Buildtech, said, “As we enter 2024, the real estate sector stands at the brink of further growth and innovation, with the forthcoming budget being a critical milestone. Contributing approximately 8% to the GDP and acting as a major employment generator, the sector’s health is crucial. The support of over 200 ancillary industries hinges on the robustness of real estate. Therefore, granting it industry status would be a pivotal step, promoting an environment for sustained growth. Measures such as single window clearance, tax breaks, and GST rationalization are essential to stimulate growth in our sector and have a ripple effect across the economy. We urge the government to champion these reforms, which are key to boosting demand, reducing costs, and elevating the real estate sector, thereby enriching our nation’s economic landscape.”

Statistics reveal a record-breaking momentum in housing sales across the top seven cities, scaling up to approximately 4.77 lakh units. Simultaneously, nearly 4.46 lakh newly-launched homes flooded the market, underscoring a thriving sector in the previous year. The disparity between government-defined parameters and practical market realities also comes to the forefront.



Vivek Singhal, CEO of Smartworld Developers, said, “The Indian real estate market witnessed robust growth in 2023, marked by new residential launches and record-high home sales. Housing sales in the top seven cities surged to an all-time high of 4.77 lakh units last year. Industry projections indicate a steady 9.2% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2028, highlighting the sector’s stability and potential. As we step into 2024, the market is gearing up for sustained demand which is propelled by various imminent factors. Consequently, the real estate industry has high expectations for the upcoming union budget.”

“The industry seeks a favourable industry status for the housing sector and emphasizes the necessity of maintaining single-window clearance for housing projects, both of which continue to remain significant this year. There is optimism surrounding anticipated policy changes, such as potential reductions in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates and efforts to reconcile material prices. Additionally, expectations revolve around prospects for tax relief and amplified deduction limits on home loans. The upcoming budget holds promise, appealing to both millennials and savvy investors with its potential offerings,” he added.

The industry’s wishlist for the upcoming budget remains consistent, calling for critical reforms, including industry status for housing and streamlined clearance processes for housing projects. Experts emphasize the pressing need to reintroduce and extend substantial benefits, such as tax breaks, to incentivize developers to build more affordable housing units and broaden accessibility for potential buyers.

Mohit Malhotra, Founder & CEO, NeoLiv, said, “We are optimistic that the budget announcements will carry provisions to empower new age developers with strong financial backing and transparent policies, and promote the growth of the housing sector in the country. One of the key proposals for the input tax credit under GST is a pivotal requirement for development companies who are pivoting this new era of the sector. Granting developers access to input tax credit is not merely a fiscal incentive; it’s a strategic move that can stimulate the sector’s growth for homebuyers, and fuel economic recovery. In the context of the mid-housing segment, a pivotal focus for us, we look forward creation of new pockets of development with focus on higher budgetary allocation for infrastructure development enabling smooth access to city centres. Mid-range housing projects play a vital role in addressing the housing needs of the middle-income demographic, and we hope that the budget recognises the future potential of this segment.”

This budget holds the key to shaping the industry’s future, understanding its challenges, and nurturing opportunities for resilience and prosperity. ANAROCK Research indicates a noticeable decline in the budget home category’s overall sales, dropping to approximately 20% in 2023 from over 30% in 2022. The percentage of affordable housing in the total housing supply in the top seven cities also decreased to 18% in 2023 from nearly 40% in 2019.

Sandeep Agarwal, CFO, Elan Group, anticipates a transformative year ahead for the Indian real estate sector, and seeks strategic fiscal measures stimulating demand for homebuyers and developers, addressing liquidity concerns, and simplifying regulations.

“These actions can revive the market and foster sustainable growth. We also expect policies promoting technological innovation, propelling a digital revolution in real estate, enhancing efficiency, and global positioning. This budget holds the key to shaping our industry’s future, understanding its challenges, and nurturing opportunities for resilience and prosperity. The upcoming agenda necessitates a multifaceted approach encompassing several critical aspects. Firstly, addressing the long-standing issue of undelivered projects is pivotal to reinstating customer confidence and trust within the real estate sector. Simultaneously, there’s an urgent need to redefine affordable housing parameters, specifically by revisiting and elevating the thresholds concerning area and value,” he said.

Additionally, rectifying the discrepancies surrounding GST input credit on commercial properties developed for leasing and moderating the impact of ineligible GST inputs on residential project prices is crucial for market stability. “Implementing a time-bound single window clearance for government regulatory processes becomes imperative to streamline operations and foster efficiency. Lastly, considering a deferred income tax liability tied to residential property investments, through a 5-7-year moratorium on tax payments, could significantly alleviate financial pressures and encourage further investments in the sector,” Agarwal added.

As the real estate industry awaits the unveiling of the interim budget, the stakes are high, and expectations run deep for measures that could redefine the housing landscape and promote broader access to affordable homes.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-heres-what-real-estate-expects-from-nirmala-sitharaman-3374753/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: What are taxpayers expecting from finance minister,"– By Poorva Prakash

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the interim budget 2024 before the Parliament on 01 February 2024. This budget would be a vote-on-account whereby she will seek approval from the Parliament for a grant in advance to meet the Centre’s expenditure for the first 4 months of 2024-25. After the election, the elected government will present the full Budget. Even though it is a vote-on-account Budget, there are however expectations from individual taxpayers of positive announcements from the government to address concerns of individuals relating to measures taken earlier.

Budget 2024 Income Tax Live Updates: Income Tax Slab Rate Change Budget 2024 Live Updates

Budget 2024 Stocks to Focus: Union Budget 2024 Impact on Share Market Today

Focus on New Tax Regime (NTR):

The New Tax Regime (NTR) was first proposed in the Union Budget 2020-21. The latest changes to the NTR were made in Union Budget 2023-24, which brought 5 significant changes – improved rebate, modified tax structures/ slabs, reduced surcharges, higher exemption on leave encashment for retirees in the private sector and extension of standard deduction in the NTR.

However, the old tax regime remains favored by many despite reduced taxes in NTR. But, theNTR does not permit claiming exemptions and deductions while computing total taxable income which is available under the old regime. Therefore, to enhance the appeal of NTR, the common man anticipates government’s consideration in:

i. Reducing the income tax rate to 20% for income between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 20 lakh and to 25% for income over Rs 20 lakh

ii. Factoring elevation in standard deduction from INR 50,000 to INR 100,000

iii. Extending rebate under Section 87A to Non-Residents

Processing of tax refunds:

Under the existing tax provisions, tax authorities can withhold refunds for taxpayers who are undergoing tax assessments or reassessment, if the refund value exceeds INR 1 million or more. In such cases, withholding of refund will block the funds of taxpayers. Hence the suitable change can be introduced under section 245 such that the taxpayer is provided with prior intimation and opportunity of being heard and limiting the withholding of refund up to 20% of the demand. This would strike a balance between the tax authorities’ assessment process and will provide a relief to the taxpayer to address any cash flow situation.

At present, tax refunds are disbursed to pre-validated Indian bank accounts. In case of non-resident individuals, particularly foreign nationals, who may have closed their Indian bank accounts upon leaving the country, there is no option to settle the tax refunds directly in their overseas bank accounts. In such cases for processing of refunds, the foreign bank accounts should be considered for tax refunds, particularly in case of PAN-holders registered as non-residents or foreign nationals.

Speedy disposal of appeals:

Various initiatives have been undertaken by the government to smoothen the compliance and litigation procedures under the tax laws. However, after the implementation of the faceless appeal scheme, case pendency at the first appellate stage “CIT(A)” has surged. To expedite the disposal of certain appeals pending with Commissioner (Appeals), a new authority in the rank of Joint Commissioner/ Additional Commissioner [JCIT(Appeals)] was introduced last year. Since, there are no prescribed timelines for disposal of appeals at this stage, prolonged litigation without closure certainty does not help in reducing the appeal backlog. Introduction of timelines for appeals disposal at the first appellate stage, could significantly help in speedy disposal of appeals.

Robust Tax Collection Machinery:

The tax administration has taken significant steps towards digitizing compliance. This has helped in increasing the taxpayer base and tax collections. To further enhance the tax base and automation, the government could introduce additional measures.

Taxpayers are allowed tax credits/other benefits in terms of taxes paid outside India, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. As of now, the benefits are available for individuals to claim in their income tax return. Hence, these individuals end up with a huge refund as there is no express provision for the employer to consider the benefit at the time of tax withholding. To provide relief and avoid refund scenarios and related cash flow issues, guidelines can be issued for considering benefits under Section 90 at the time of tax withholding and disclosing them appropriately in the eTDS returns.

Furthermore, according to current provisions, resident home buyers are required to deposit 1% of the purchase value as TDS, where the property value is INR 50 lakh or more. Although the TDS deposit process is simple and convenient, the requirements are more complex if the seller is a Non-Resident Indian (NRI). In cases where the seller is an NRI, the tax is deducted at a higher rate and the buyer is also required to obtain a TAN, deposit the tax deducted, and file e-TDS returns. Obtaining TAN for the mentioned purpose alone may result in having more inactive TANs down the line. To address the above-mentioned issue, the TDS process applicable for cases where the seller is an NRI, may be eased by introducing a TDS process that is similar to that of a Resident seller.

While, major announcements via interim budget 2024 may be unlikely given that it is a vote-on-account Budget, some of the aforementioned changes could address the expectations of the taxpayers.

Budget 2024 Stocks to Focus: Union Budget 2024 Impact on Share Market Today

Redefining Affordable Housing: The definition of affordable housing should change across cities. The current cap of Rs 45 lakhs is not sufficient for major cities. It has become very difficult to find a property within Rs 45 lakhs. The government should increase the cap to at least Rs 60-65 lakhs, allowing more people to take advantage of the incentives for affordable housing. Especially, in cities such as Mumbai, where the property values are already exponentially high, this cap should be increased to at least Rs 85 lakhs. This move would likely bring more homes within reach of buyers, aligning with the government’s efforts to promote affordable housing.



Streamlining Processes: One of the critical needs of the real estate sector is the establishment of a single window for all transaction processes. Currently, navigating through over 30 approvals from various state and union government authorities is a daunting task for builders. The implementation of a single-window clearance system is crucial for expediting project approvals, reducing delays, and enhancing overall efficiency in project execution.

Tax Rebate on Home Loan Interest Rates: The real estate sector is hopeful for an adjustment in Section 24 of the Income Tax Act, increasing the tax rebate on home loan interest rates from the current Rs 2 lakh to at least Rs 5 lakh. This move is likely to boost the real estate sector by providing a greater incentive for people to buy property.

Reducing the Long-Term Capital Gain Tax: A potential revision in the long-term capital gains tax on property, reducing it from the existing 20% to 10%, could foster increased investment in the property market. This will also contribute to overall economic growth by unlocking the potential for enhanced real estate transactions and market dynamics.

Simplification of Taxation on REIT: The current taxation framework for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) is quite complex, presenting a challenge for investors and other stakeholders. The government should call for a simpler structure in order to streamline processes and enhance the attractiveness of REITs as an investment avenue.

Stamp Duty Concessions: Offering concessions in stamp duty rates or allowing twice the duty paid as expenditure under income tax could incentivize more agreements to be registered, facilitating smoother property transactions. It’s worth noting that during the pandemic, the Government of Maharashtra had reduced the stamp duty to 2-3% of the property value, which had driven more people to buy properties.

Friendly Home Loan Policies: Reflecting on recent repo rate revisions, experts hope for measures that decrease the down payment burden and ease home loan eligibility criteria. Such initiatives aim to make credit more accessible, fostering a positive trend in home-buying.

Incentives for Rental Housing: The influx of people migrating to their workplace cities has increased the demand for rental properties near offices and IT parks. The available limited supply of properties is unable to meet this heightened demand. This disparity between demand and supply has resulted in an exponential increase in property rents. In order to stabilize the rental market, there is a pressing need to offer incentives to invest in rental housing units so that housing stock can be created to meet the heightened demand.

Increase HRA in Bangalore & Hyderabad: The current HRA classification, delineating a clear contrast between metro and non-metro cities, has resulted in discrepancies in housing allowances. Presently, the clause stipulates that employees residing in the recognized metro cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, or Chennai are eligible for an HRA of 50% of their basic salary. But those residing in non-metro cities receive a reduced allowance of 40% of their basic salary. This classification fails to include major cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad, where rentals are extremely high. Consequently, a reassessment of this classification is imperative to ensure a fair and equitable HRA framework that accurately reflects the escalating costs of living, especially in cities that have become economic powerhouses.

Real Estate Should Get Industry Status: Being the third largest sector in India, real estate contributes 8% of the GDP. However, it still lacks industry status. Granting the status to the real estate sector would yield substantial advantages, both legally and administratively. This recognition could open avenues for capital and interest subsidies, providing a significant boost to developers, especially smaller ones facing hurdles in securing financing at lower rates.

Nikhil Chopra, CEO & Whole Time Director, JB Pharma, said that India faces an increasing disease burden, demanding a sustained and strategic healthcare focus.

“The government’s recognition of this pressing reality and its consistent efforts to strengthen the nation’s healthcare infrastructure, has been commendable. The upcoming budget is anticipated to mirror this commitment. An allocation of about 2.5%-3% towards healthcare is crucial to support the industry cater to the growing healthcare needs of India. In our pursuit of self-sufficiency and reduced dependency on imports, undertaking well-crafted measures to streamline the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) emerges as a crucial catalyst to ensure that the industry is motivated to leverage this opportunity, for the growth of indigenous pharmaceutical manufacturing. This strategic move holds the potential to enhance our competitiveness globally, effectively address pricing challenges, and contribute significantly to the nation’s economic resilience,” Chopra said.

V.S. Mani, Executive Director & Global Chief Finance Officer, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. said that the move towards introducing centres of excellence in the pharmaceutical sector promises to drive the industry-academia relationship in the right direction.

“Promotion of Research and Innovation in the Pharma MedTech Sector (PRIP) as well as the successful Production Linked Incentive Scheme demonstrate the government’s unwavering commitment to fostering self-reliance in India. Going ahead, the focus needs to be on retaining the skilled workforce and introducing robust initiatives that incentivize top scientific talent,” Mani said.

Meanwhile, Nikkhil K Masurkar, CEO, Entod Pharmaceuticals highlighted that as a pharmaceutical company, we anticipate a favorable environment in the Union Budget 2024-25, with a heightened focus on bolstering research and development (R&D) in the sector.

“The government’s commitment, as demonstrated through the recent policy launched in September, underscores a strategic shift towards positioning India as a high-value player in the global pharmaceutical market. The allocated capital outlay of Rs 5,000 crore, with a dedicated budget of Rs 4,250 crore for research in priority areas, reflects a strong financial commitment to fostering innovation in pharmaceuticals. We look forward to continued government support, expecting these initiatives to enhance the R&D capabilities of the $50-billion pharma sector, contributing to sustained growth and global competitiveness,” Masurkar said.

With the pharmaceutical industry ranking as the world’s third-largest by volume, the potential growth trajectory of reaching $120-130 billion over the next decade is contingent on sustained innovation and discoveries.

“The inclusive financial assistance for entities of varying sizes, from large corporations to startups collaborating with government institutes, signals a comprehensive approach to supporting research endeavors. As we await the budget announcement, we remain optimistic that the proposed measures will further catalyze research and development, positioning the industry for a value-led future growth trajectory,” he said.

Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance said that the India has played a pivotal role in shaping global health outcomes by providing affordable quality-assured medicines.

“Today, the Indian pharmaceutical industry is at the cusp of change. The Indian pharma sector aims to achieve USD 120–130 by 2030 and USD 400-450 by 2047. To achieve this vision, the Union Budget 2024-25 should accelerate the pace of innovation and R&D. The announcement of the Promotion of Research & Innovation Program (PRIP) Scheme in 2023 was a positive step to spur innovation. Given the high risk, long gestation period and low success rate in research, there is a need for continuous investments. Therefore, the budget 2024-25 should outline conducive policies that provide benefits in terms of both direct and indirect taxes and also facilitate ease of doing business for the pharmacos,” Jain said.

The year 2024 is likely to witness the initial results of the various initiatives to augment India as a reliable supplier of medicines, Jain pointed out.

“Policy stability and continuity will be fundamental to propel the sector’s growth. India is poised to move to “Discover and Make in India” from “Make in India”, making India the custodian of healthcare of the world,” he added.

Saransh Chaudhary, President, Global Critical Care, Venus Remedies Ltd, and CEO, Venus Medicine Research Centre (VMRC) explained that the upcoming Union Budget 2024-2025 will determine how well India progresses with regard to achieving its stated objectives of becoming the ‘Pharmacy to the World’ and embracing ‘OneHealth’ principles.

“The government must continue incentivizing R&D and manufacturing to boost growth and innovation in the industry, something which was particularly evident in the Promotion of Research and Innovation in Pharma Med-Tech Sector (PRIP) scheme from the previous budget. The second component of the PRIP scheme, with an allocation of Rs 4,250 crore, focused on research in the pharmaceutical sector, especially in six priority areas including antimicrobial resistance (AMR). A continued emphasis on prioritizing antibiotic research is crucial to help address the growing challenge of AMR,” Chaudhary said.

We suggest exploring innovative economic models to incentivize antibiotic research, recognizing the unique challenges associated with it, he said.

“Market entry rewards and delinked subscription models could be considered to encourage pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new antibiotics. This strategic approach aligns with the goal of fortifying India’s position as a global pharma leader and addressing pressing healthcare challenges, including AMR. Additionally, sustained efforts to address rising input costs, particularly the steep hike in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) prices are imperative,” he added

According to Chaudhary, Incentives for domestic API manufacturers, coupled with a reduction in GST and import duty on APIs, would significantly enhance industry’s sustainability.

“The establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) for research, exempted from GST, merits serious consideration. The continuation of the Research-Linked Incentive scheme and tax exemptions for materials procured for R&D purposes is crucial for creating a conducive ecosystem that enables R&D-driven pharma companies in India to compete globally,” he said.

Finally, the government must prioritize funds for digital integration in pharma supply chain, ensuring better access and uninterrupted deliveries in real time, since this is crucial for healthcare transformation, he added.

Dr. Krishna Prasad Chigurupati, Chairman & Managing Director of Granules India Limited said that India’s pharmaceutical sector has rightfully earned the title ‘pharmacy of the world,’ thanks to its extensive production of generic medications. The industry is now poised for a transformative leap – evolving into a global hub for innovative products and sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing.

“To realize this vision, the Indian government needs to implement focused strategies. These include creating innovation zones offering incentives and infrastructural support, encouraging public-private partnerships to combine expertise and resources, and boosting funding for advanced drug research and development. Streamlining regulatory pathways to expedite approvals for novel treatments and investing in educational initiatives to develop a workforce adept in pharmaceutical innovation are also key. These initiatives are expected to usher in a new age of Indian pharmaceutical leadership, characterized by groundbreaking R&D,” Dr. Chigurupati said.

India’s potential in sustainable manufacturing is immense, set to substantially contribute to the fight against climate change, he said.

“With the manufacturing sector projected to add 800-900 billion to the GDP in the next 4-5 years, India is on the brink of revolutionizing manufacturing, integrating sustainability with cutting-edge science and technology. This approach is critical in addressing the global climate crisis. Embracing ambitious renewable energy and green hydrogen projects, India is gearing up to be a leader in sustainable product manufacturing. This demonstrates the country’s commitment to sustainable development, economic growth, energy independence, and leading the charge in global decarbonization. Innovations in renewable energy, Electrolyzer, green molecules, biobased manufacturing, and advancements in Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) are just a few areas where we need to accelerate progress. With the right policies and initiatives, India can transform these potentials into reality, securing its position as a global hub for sustainable manufacturing,” he said.



Anil Matai, Director General, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) highlighted that the government’s consistent efforts to boost sector investments in R&D for pharma are commendable.

“In the last budget, key initiatives were introduced, such as establishing centers of excellence for Artificial Intelligence to enhance manpower skills to develop cutting-edge applications and scalable problem solutions in critical areas including health, announcement of programme to promote research and innovation in the pharma sector through centres of excellence and encouraging collaborative research and innovation by public & private medical college faculty and private sector R&D team through select ICMR labs. These strategic steps underscore the government’s commitment to addressing the industry’s priorities to position India as a global hub for end-to-end drug discovery and boost India’s image as a pharma innovation hub,” Matai said.

To further support research to develop innovative pharma product, OPPI believes that the concessional tax rates under Section 115BAB of Income Tax Act, 1961 should be extended to companies solely engaged in R&D of pharma as well, beyond those related to manufactured articles, he said.

“We also hope for the elimination of import duties on life-saving drugs, recognizing that individuals should not bear substantial taxes during health crises. Simultaneously, we call for increased incentives for innovation and to attract foreign investment in advanced research. Emphasizing the importance of Intellectual Property (IP) protection, we recognize that India’s evolution beyond a volume supplier depends on prioritizing groundbreaking innovations. The implementation of these measures would not only strengthen the pharmaceutical and biotech sector but also enhance India’s global standing in innovation and healthcare,” he added.

Sandeep Jain, Managing Director, Akums Drugs & Pharmaceuticals said that as we await the unveiling of the 2024 budget, the Indian pharmaceutical industry seeks a roadmap that not only acknowledges its pivotal role in healthcare but also pushes it towards sustainable growth and innovation. “A significant boost in healthcare spending tops our list of priorities. Increased allocations are crucial not only to strengthen our healthcare infrastructure but also to ensure quality healthcare services reach every corner of our diverse nation,” Jain said.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-pharma-industry-leaders-urge-govt-for-conducive-policies-and-incentivise-domestic-api-manufacturers-3371811/
financialexpress.com,"Budget 2024: Diagnostics industry leaders advocate for investments towards innovation, R&D and bolstering patient safety measures","Budget 2024: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Interim Budget 2024 on February 1.

There is still immense untapped potential in various disease categories in terms of diagnosis as well as treatment (through research and drug discovery) and India is poised to lead this genetic revolution, Chakrabartty said.

“Public awareness is crucial for the success of genetic testing in India which we believe will play a key role in treating non-communicable and communicable diseases in the country, given the large disease burden for lifestyle diseases. In this regard we would urge the Government of India to lead awareness campaigns that can educate and build trust around the effectiveness and benefits of genetic testing in identifying and managing these diseases,” he said.

With India’s strong scientific capabilities and technology expertise, we can become leaders in genomics research, by channelizing our resources in the right direction and increasing collaboration between the Private, and Public sectors in research and development, he said.

“Some ways in which we can achieve this would be by allocating funds for large-scale programs studying rare diseases prevalent in our diverse population, making prenatal genetic testing a part of Maternity Benefits Schemes, creating more awareness around rare disorders and the support available to the patients today. This will pave the way for building a healthy future generation and help lower the disease burden in the country. The next step is genomics aided biomarker and drug discovery, where India should leverage its inherent advantages to innovate and commercialize new therapies,” he explained.

For further progress and building a robust genomics infrastructure, we must establish strict regulatory guidelines and ethical frameworks. This will encourage competitiveness and investment in strengthening our overall healthcare ecosystem, he added.

Meanwhile, Ameera Shah, Promoter and Managing Director, Metropolis Healthcare said that the upcoming Union Budget for 2024-2025 holds significant importance in strengthening India’s healthcare ecosystem.

“The forthcoming budget should serve as a driving force, channelling investments towards critical areas such as innovation, research and development, technology, upgrading healthcare infrastructure, and bolstering patient safety measures. Given the escalating burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), we emphasize the necessity for regular and inclusive screening and diagnostics programmes along with more skilling courses for health professionals to attract as well as upskill talent in the diagnostic space. Additionally, we strongly advocate for the government’s consideration to implement a 0% GST on diagnostic services and facilitate refunds for GST paid on inputs. Recognizing that 60% of India’s diagnostics are reliant on imports, it becomes paramount for the government to rationalize import tariffs on healthcare products. Low-cost financing schemes can enable private players to upgrade and add diagnostic infrastructure in tier 2 and 3 geographies. These initiatives will not only enhance accessibility and affordability but also lay the groundwork for a robust healthcare ecosystem that can effectively combat present and future healthcare challenges,” Shah said.

Deepak Sahni, Founder of Healthians said that they expect a significant rise in the allocation of funds towards healthcare.

“More funds need to be provided to boost manufacturing of medical equipment and there need to be regulations to reduce the influx of imports. The PLI schemes for IT hardware, mobile phones, drugs and medical devices attracted investments of over US$30 billion. Introducing more health-related product categories into the PLI scheme can make India self-reliant and shield us from shocks in the global supply chain. PPP models should be encouraged for better healthcare, service, delivery and infrastructure development, particularly for critical and non-communicable diseases,” Sahni said.

Health insurance needs to be made more comprehensive and affordable, and diagnostics should be brought into its purview, he said.

“We also need more tax benefits and incentives for the healthcare industry and for individuals investing in their health, wellness, and preventive check-ups. Indirect taxation and lack of input credit for providers poses a significant challenge for the healthcare industry. While most healthcare services are exempt from GST, procurement taxes (whether for inputs, input services or capital goods) form a significant part of the operational costs. A ‘zero rating’ of GST on healthcare services will keep the credit chain intact and reduce costs,” he revealed.

Thomas Gebauer, Associate Director, Marketing, Progenesis said in the forthcoming fiscal period, our budgetary priorities are geared towards democratizing access to pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) in India, while simultaneously spearheading global expansion initiatives.

“A substantial portion of our budget should be allocated to advancing technology and incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into the genetic testing processes. Furthermore, our budget outlines strategic collaborations with international healthcare organizations and research institutions to facilitate seamless global expansion. These alliances are crucial in ensuring the dissemination of advanced genetic testing methodologies to diverse populations. The increased budget allocation also extends to comprehensive training programs for healthcare professionals, ensuring that they are proficient in utilizing the latest technologies for optimal patient care. Simultaneously, proactive outreach campaigns will be executed to raise awareness about the importance of PGT and its accessibility across different economic strata. Leveraging telemedicine solutions will bridge geographical gaps, enabling individuals from remote areas to access state-of-the-art genetic testing services,” Gebauer said.

Sachidanand Upadhyay, MD & CEO, Lord’s Mark Industries said that they expect the government to continue with its focus to develop infrastructure facilities in the form of medical device parks so that the medical device industry becomes self-reliant.

“Localisation of the supply chain of medical device and kit manufacturing will ensure better healthcare outcomes for the country in terms of availability and affordability. The budget needs to propose allocation of resources to expand digital infrastructure and build R&D facilities to ensure superior healthcare delivery and interventions,” Upadhyay said.

Meanwhile, Ved Goel, Group CFO, Dr. Lal PathLabs pointed out that they anticipate positive strides in the healthcare and diagnostics sector with the potential revision of GST rates and a reduction in import tariffs on medical products and services in the upcoming budget.

“This pivotal move is poised to make healthcare services more affordable and accessible to communities. It is crucial, however, that compliance measures for exempt healthcare providers are streamlined, addressing issues such as reverse charge GST payments and interstate movements of inventory/machines. By incentivizing the healthcare sector and encouraging additional investments, we can significantly expand our reach to the last mile, ensuring that quality healthcare reaches every corner of the nation. As we move forward, we look forward to a budget that not only fosters industry growth but also prioritizes the well-being of the entire population,” Goel said.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-diagnostics-industry-leaders-advocate-for-investments-towards-innovation-rd-and-bolstering-patient-safety-measures-3371777/

The body said that last year the Medical Devices Industry Proposal for Union Budget 2023-24 was not considered even though the Department of Pharma has been supporting it.

“It’s disheartening to note that imports are still on an increasing uptrend of over 21% over the last 12 months at Rs. 61,000 Crore compared to Rs. 50,000 Crore in the same period of preceding 12 months. Policy makers need to review the steep 33% increase in imports from the USA (the dominant exporting country to India) of Rs. 10858 Crore over Rs. 8186 Crore in 2021-22, Germany up at Rs. 6188 Crore from Rs. 4855 Crore in 2022, by a steep 27%.Imports from the Netherlands also increased by 20 percent to Rs 3552 crore in 2022-23 from Rs 2956 crore in 2021-22, whereas imports from China increased by 11 percent at Rs. 10,384 crore in 2022-23 from Rs. 9374 crore in 2021-22 and Singapore by 15 percent from Rs. 4800 crore to Rs. 5520 crore,” Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator, Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD) said in a statement.

Nath also revealed that unless policies of consumer electronics and mobile phone manufacturing by levy of nominal 15% duty are replicated to Medical Devices, India will continue to be more than 80% import-dependent at zero to 7.5% duty rates.

“It’s not that we are not competent, in many products India is globally competitive but sadly not in our own country. Also consumers are protected by MRP capping and price controls post monitoring and not by making them dependent on imports at zero duties with MRP at over 10-20 times of Imports Landed price,” he said.

Nath also highlighted the need to reschedule the duty revision of Key Components of X-Ray Equipment that had been planned under a Phased Manufacturing Plan (PMP) as manufacturing of these components has not yet started and the duty increase is now creating an Inverted Duty Structure making India X-Ray equipment manufacturer non-competitive.

AiMeD has the following Budget recommendations to end the 80-85 percent import dependence forced upon India and an ever-increasing import bill of over Rs. 63,200 crore:

Increase in Custom Duty to a nominal 10%-15% Duty and a predictable tariff policy

Correction of Inverted Duty by levying Health Cess of 5% custom duty on balance Medical Devices (this was not earlier applied to all HS Codes). Cess is used for Ayushman Bharat.

Trade Margin Capping by monitoring MRP of Imports (if over 10 – 20 times of CIF)

Income Tax benefits for project investments in Medical Devices Manufacturing.

As per GTRI report of August 2023, the Indian medical devices industry can expand from $12 billion to $50 billion by 2030, reducing import reliance to 35% and boosting exports to $18 billion.

“Supporting policies are needed so that Indian Medical Devices Industry can make quality healthcare accessible and affordable for the common masses, aim to place India among the top five medical devices manufacturing hubs worldwide and help end the 80-85 per cent import dependence forced upon us and an ever-increasing import bill of over 63,200 Crore,” the body stated.

Ahead of the interim budget 2024, the healthcare industry is demanding increased expenditure, equitable supply and utilisation and strategic investments and incentives that foster innovation, research, and development within the sector.

“We want to see a comprehensive approach to healthcare spending in the interim budget of 2024. The expenditure on basic healthcare, which includes treating common health concerns, giving necessary medications, caring for mothers and children, immunising, and other preventative actions, has been one of the main problems with the Indian health system. Equitable supply and utilisation, focusing on marginalised groups, outpatient care, and dynamic cost coverage are what must be prioritised,” said Ankur Gigras, CEO and Co-founder, HexaHealth.

Gigras also pointed out that emphasis should be placed on innovative medical technologies like artificial intelligence, which may improve the quality of life for patients during operations, speed up insurance claims for required procedures, and raise the efficacy of healthcare delivery overall.

“In order to pave the way for a healthier, more technologically sophisticated future for our country, we hope that the budget will acknowledge these problems and actively support efforts to address them,” he said.

Meanwhile, Viren Shetty, Executive Vice Chairman of Narayana Health maintains that the Indian healthcare sector’s growth is commendable, and it has benefited from dedicated policy and regulatory support from the government.

“Recognizing the need for providing Universal Health Care, we expect the interim Union Budget 2024-25 to unveil a roadmap for addressing long-term infrastructure financing, increasing the number of medical & nursing colleges, and fiscal reforms in the health insurance sector. India needs a health insurance model that prioritizes preventive healthcare over procedures, and Narayana Health is well placed to achieve this goal with the support of the government,” Shetty said.

Some experts also emphasised on the need to increased budget allocation for addressing the challenge of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

Susanta Kumar Ghosh, Scientific Advisor at Eco BioTraps and Former Scientist G at ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research, Bengaluru, said that in the 2023-24 budget plan, a substantial allocation of 89,565 crores had been designated for the health sector.

“The National Health Mission (NHM) is a pivotal initiative within this budget aimed at addressing both communicable and non-communicable diseases, significantly impacting health delivery. A commendable allocation of 35,947 crores had been directed towards NHM, encompassing comprehensive programs for both rural and urban health. Within the NHM framework, specific funds have been earmarked for the National Disease Control Programme, focusing on tuberculosis and vector-borne diseases,” Ghosh said.

It is noteworthy that the National Centre for Vector Borne Diseases Control (NCVBDC) primarily addresses six vector borne diseases such as malaria, Filaria, Kala-azar, Japanese Encephalitis, dengue and chikungunya besides other disease like Zika, West Nile Virus, Scrub Typhus, Kyasanur Forest Disease, Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic fever are also come under the umbrella of NCVBDC.

“As per the available resources, the annual budget of NCVBDC is estimated to be around 1400 to 1500 crores. has received a dedicated budget of 1500 crores. NHM has an additional supportive budget of about 8 to 10%. Hence the total budget varies from 4200 to 4500 crores. Despite the importance of addressing vector-borne diseases, this sector only constitutes 10% of the NHM budget, amounting to 4000 crores. This amount is not enough when three diseases malaria, filaria and Kala-azar are under the process of elimination by 2030. A significant reduction of malaria cases have been recorded since 2015. About 90% of the malaria cases are concentrated in the 8 tribal states in 27 districts. Camp-based, DASTAK-like programme launched in Uttar Pradesh for effective control of Japanese Encephalitis should find a place with sufficient funding,” Ghosh pointed out.



Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (ELF) is now present in 272 endemic districts. “Special funding should also be made available for home-based morbidity case management. Also special financial assistance should be provided to the patients with Lymphedema needing integrative medicine. Currently less than 1000 patients are reported for Kala-azar. Strict monitoring would achieve the goal of elimination of mosquito-borne diseases. After all, ‘Log Bhagidar’ is the main focus on management of vector borne diseases effectively,” he added.

Some industry leader also urged that governement that budget should also focus on strategic investments and incentives that foster innovation, research, and development within the health tech sector.

“We must focus on strategic investments and incentives that foster innovation, research, and development within the healthtech sector, as technology plays a pivotal role in transforming healthcare. We suggest innovative strategies to incentivize research and development, such as tax exemptions or credits for businesses that invest in state-of-the-art equipment that improves telemedicine, diagnostics, and patient care. The effective deployment and uptake of healthtech solutions across the nation would be further ensured by a budgetary allocation specifically designated for the training of medical professionals in digital tools and technologies. We think that the government can stimulate the healthtech sector’s expansion, which will ultimately improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of healthcare,” Harsimarbir Singh, Co-founder, Pristyn Care said.

Vikram Thaploo, CEO- Telehealth, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises Limited said that they look forward to potential changes in GST tariffs and services covered under healthcare, expecting measures to strengthen import regulations and create an environment conducive for the growth of indigenous manufacturers.

“We are optimistic about the upcoming budget, recognizing the critical role of technology in advancing healthcare. We anticipate the government’s commitment to furthering the adoption of digital health technologies, including IoT, AI, data analytics, and electronic health records, aligning with the National Digital Health Mission. We hope to see increased funding to boost the manufacturing of medical equipment domestically, fostering the ‘Make in India’ initiative and supporting local manufacturers. Additionally, we look forward to potential changes in GST tariffs and services covered under healthcare, expecting measures to strengthen import regulations and create an environment conducive for the growth of indigenous manufacturers,” Thaploo said.

He also said that their expectation is that the budget will prioritize investments in public health infrastructure, primary healthcare facilities, and essential medicines, while promoting telemedicine and digital healthcare solutions. “We urge the government to consider expanding Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes to cover the development of supporting hardware for advanced digital technologies like Generative AI. Allocating resources for training and reskilling the workforce is crucial for optimizing the economic impact of these technologies, fostering both innovation and employment opportunities,” he added.

Dr. Narendra Vankar, Founder and CEO, Quantum CorpHealth said that this is India’s second post-pandemic budget, and unfortunately, last year’s budget for the healthcare sector was lacking.

“This year, it is imperative to focus on bettering India’s health infrastructure like more hospitals with an increased number of medical professionals for our growing population. More importantly, investing in advancements in technology and innovation will play a big role in improving the healthcare sector in India. Technology can be boosted through government intervention. There should be a collaboration between the private and public sectors to improve telehealth in India. We have seen India embrace digital technologies in other sectors like banking and education, so why not for healthcare also? Only a few years ago, it was shrugged off as being too complicated and inefficient, but with how rapidly we have evolved, we can now use a higher budget in healthcare to further improve the quality and accessibility of medical practice in India. According to reports, the healthcare industry has the potential to increase tenfold over the next decade, if we begin to improve now,” Dr. Vankar said.

The growing rate of the ageing population in India should also be a cause for concern. As medicine and healthcare improve, lifespans increase.

“However, we are lacking the ability to take care of the geriatric population as nursing homes are being overloaded and private care homes are only accessible for an elite few. Large-scale companies and start-ups should come together to make this niche ecosystem a more equitable space for all. While there are government policies available for senior citizens like the Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana to provide assisted living devices, their healthcare is not taken seriously enough. We need more robust policies for the elderly, especially those who are living alone,” Dr. Vankar emphasised.

When it comes to corporate healthcare, there is a lack of policy when it comes to healthcare startups, he revealed.

“India needs to include regulatory policies in addition to the budget. The country needs to create a favourable funding environment for companies and startups which are supported by government schemes and policies. While the Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to provide free health insurance access to low-income earners across the country, there needs to be a heightened focus on taking care of the health of our invaluable workforce and making sure that their health comes first, not only for the economic good of the country but also for their responsibilities to their families,” he added.

Meanwhile, Dr Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, MD and CEO, Fortis Healthcare & President, NATHEALTH said that as India navigates the critical path of healthcare reform, NATHEALTH has presented a comprehensive set of budget recommendations to the government, targeting transformative changes.

“Our proposals emphasize the need to bridge regional healthcare disparities through inclusive and innovative strategies. We are advocating for an increase in healthcare spending to 2.5% of GDP and the rationalisation of the GST framework. Additionally, we aim to enhance the medical value travel segment by addressing the MAT credit issue and strengthening the healthcare value chain, which is essential for driving economic growth and creating new job opportunities. A key focus should be on building local capabilities to deliver healthcare services even in the most remote regions, alongside the localization of the healthcare value chain. Equally important is the capacity building and training of healthcare professionals, which is crucial to cater to our nation’s increasing healthcare needs. These measures are fundamental to developing a resilient and efficient healthcare system in India,” Dr. Raghuvanshi said.



Rohit Mehta, Founder & Managing Director, ICPA Health Products Ltd. (ICPA) demanded inproved accessibility of healthcare services in rural India.

“With nearly two-thirds of India’s population residing in rural areas, access to medical services remains a critical challenge. This coupled with the fact that per capital income of an urban person is nearly double to that of his rural counterpart, it simply highlights the fact the if we have to improve our country’s standing on medical services, the focus should be the rural areas where lot needs to be done. The stark disparity in doctor-to-population ratios between rural and urban areas leaves the rural population significantly disadvantaged in healthcare access. Unfortunately because of this, the rural population fails to get the medical facilities greatly as compared to the urban. This we are talking about the basic medical health (largely catered by General Practitioners or MBBS doctors). However, specialists like heart surgeons and neurosurgeons are virtually absent in most rural areas, severely limiting access to advanced medical care,” Mehta said.

In the upcoming Budget, we urge the Government to prioritize rural healthcare in its budgetary allocations, investing both directly in infrastructure and medical personnel; and through targeted incentives to attract doctors and hospitals to underserved areas, he emphasised.

Dr. Sujit Paul, Group CEO at Zota Healthcare Ltd. maintained that to ensure affordable and world-class healthcare for the Indian masses, the Union Budget 2024 must prioritize key initiatives.

“Firstly, increasing healthcare budget allocation to 2.5% of GDP will bolster reforms and infrastructure nationwide. Secondly, a dedicated budget for upskilling healthcare workers, including pharmacists, is essential. Thirdly, implementing a PLI scheme for the healthcare sector will incentivize entities to enhance health infrastructure. Restructuring the healthcare GST framework addresses taxation challenges for providers. Additionally, integrating generic medicines into Ayushman Bharat yojana eliminates out-of-pocket expenses. Embracing telehealth in Ayushman Bharat yojana is crucial. The Budget’s positive focus on pharmaceutical R&D promises innovation and breakthroughs, fostering an environment for an Atma Nirbhar Bharat. Success hinges on sustained funding, industry collaboration, and attracting diverse talent while maintaining safety standards, aligning with our goal of advancing a healthcare system tailored to the masses’ needs,” Dr. Paul said.

Shyatto Raha, Founder & CEO, MyHealthcare said that government should actively explore the opportunity of engaging healthcare start-ups, to build a partnership between National Health Authority and healthcare providers, in implementation of clinical ecosystems such as electronic medical records(EMR).

“This will help in building a digital, patient longitudinal history, which through the NHA ecosystem can deliver the unified healthcare system for patients. The deployment of EMRs will help in standardisation of healthcare delivery, offer better insights into clinical data analytics, which can help healthcare providers to manage the complete patient care continuum and deliver better care outcomes. This comprehensive approach not only encourages healthcare providers to embrace digital technologies but also empowers entities like ours to significantly contribute to the government’s vision in building an effective healthcare system for India. We hope the Union Budget 2024, will lay emphasis in building an implementation roadmap for healthcare digitalisation, which incentivises the healthcare sector to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for Amrit Kaal 2047 and delivering quality healthcare for all,” Raha said.



Narasimhan Narayanan, President – EssilorLuxottica South Asia said that it is crucial to emphasise the importance of healthcare support, specifically regarding visual health.

“More than half of the population in India requires some form of correction, of which currently, only 37% receive it. In line with the WHO Vision 2030 goals, we urge the government to allocate support and establish a comprehensive policy framework to address visual issues effectively. We must prioritise combating myopia and promoting eye health for greater productivity of the country. The private sector looks forward to stronger public-private partnerships to create awareness and develop viable solutions. To address the challenges of access and affordability in eyecare, we hope the budget allocates resources for initiatives such as subsidising eyecare products, investing in infrastructure related to eyecare services, and increasing awareness among communities. We hope the budget enables a future where quality healthcare, including eyecare services, becomes a right for everyone,” Narayanan said.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-healthcare-sector-emphasise-on-infrastructure-financing-incentivising-rd-and-regulatory-policies-for-health-startups-3371537/

“The budget allocation to the healthcare sector should be increased by the government. It is crucial to elevate the healthcare expenditure allocation in GDP to improve accessibility, affordability, and more importantly the quality of healthcare services in India, especially in parts away from big cities focusing on preventive care, primary clinics, and secondary care facilities,” Raj Gore, CEO, Healthcare Global Enterprises Ltd. said.

For the upcoming budget, Gore urges the government to consider:

Reducing Customs Duties and GST: To advance cancer diagnostics and treatment, advocate reducing customs duties and GST on essential equipment, reagents, and consumables. This fosters investment in cancer hospitals and lowers overall treatment costs for patients.

To advance cancer diagnostics and treatment, advocate reducing customs duties and GST on essential equipment, reagents, and consumables. This fosters investment in cancer hospitals and lowers overall treatment costs for patients. Scaling Up Healthcare Workers (HCWs): Crucial to healthcare is allocating resources for the expansion of the workforce (HCWs). Providing training, staff, and screening tools for early cancer detection improves patient outcomes, making an investment in the nation’s overall well-being.

Crucial to healthcare is allocating resources for the expansion of the workforce (HCWs). Providing training, staff, and screening tools for early cancer detection improves patient outcomes, making an investment in the nation’s overall well-being. Inclusion of Advanced Diagnostic and Treatment Modalities: Include advanced diagnostics and treatments like PET scans, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy in government schemes to ensure that patients have access to cutting-edge technologies and therapies.

“It’s high time we brought change in healthcare dialogue, prioritizing value and comprehensive treatment for all. This will not only enhance the quality of healthcare services but also streamline care delivery, ultimately benefiting a broader segment of the population by improving overall healthcare outcomes,” he added.

Meanwhile, Deepshikha Sharma, CEO, Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals said that there is a collective aspiration within the medical community for the government to intensify its focus on public health education through enhanced disease awareness campaigns.

“Such initiatives are vital for improving patient care and can lead to early detection and management of diseases, potentially saving lives and reducing the burden on our healthcare infrastructure. Alongside this, the healthcare sector anticipates a pivotal change with the equalization of the GST rate for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) with that of formulations. This adjustment is crucial for fostering a cost-effective domestic pharmaceutical industry and ensuring the availability of affordable medicines for all segments of our population,” Sharma said.

Furthermore, the extension of concessional tax benefits for new domestic manufacturing entities is eagerly awaited, she said.

“It’s a step that would provide a much-needed impetus to the ‘Make in India’ initiative and sustain the country’s growth trajectory in the healthcare manufacturing sector. Such proactive measures by the government would be instrumental in catalyzing innovation and self-sufficiency within the healthcare sector,” she added.



Dr Azad Moopen, Founder Chairman, Aster DM Healthcare highlighted that in the last Union Budget, the overall impetus for the healthcare delivery sector was missing. “We are hoping that this will get addressed in the upcoming Union Budget with an increase in budget allocation to minimum 5% of the GDP which is essential to fulfil the need gaps, he said. He recommended the following steps:

Expanding Healthcare Access: There is a need to have more hospitals and healthcare facilities in rural and suburban areas to meet the rising demand given that Ayushman Bharat is aiming to make affordable healthcare accessible for 500 million people. Hope the government will put more focus on public-private partnerships (PPP) to address this, and also permit 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in both Health Insurance and Retail Pharmacy sectors.

Hope the government will put more focus on public-private partnerships (PPP) to address this, and also permit 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in both Health Insurance and Retail Pharmacy sectors. Medical Education and Research Reform: While the last budget announced the establishment of nursing colleges alongside medical colleges, there is an urgent need for comprehensive reform of medical education to ensure that the medical professionals of tomorrow are aligned with contemporary healthcare needs. This brings forth the need to develop medical colleges, nursing colleges and paramedical colleges in all the 500 district hospitals in the country.

While the last budget announced the establishment of nursing colleges alongside medical colleges, there is an urgent need for comprehensive reform of medical education to ensure that the medical professionals of tomorrow are aligned with contemporary healthcare needs. This brings forth the need to develop medical colleges, nursing colleges and paramedical colleges in all the 500 district hospitals in the country. The healthcare sector is evolving rapidly, and this has been fast-tracked by the pandemic and there is a significant need for the professionals of tomorrow to learn and develop as per this evolution. The revamp will also require significant investments to integrate access to technology, more practical approaches, research and innovation driven methods and qualified professionals to help shape the best minds. A substantial allocation, including the setting up of Central Medical Research and Innovation Institute in each state would be a good start. Setting up a Central Digital Health and AI University will also help deploy technological innovation in healthcare to address challenges such as accessibility and equity along with healthcare costs. Additionally, there should be a specialized university catering to NRI students intending to return to India for academic pursuits.

NRI Concessions: We were also hoping for concessions for NRIs residing abroad like reduction on TDS for those who have a source of income in India and are required to pay taxes in the country they reside in. Other considerations include affordable airline fares to SAARC and GCC countries to support the growing trade and business collaborations between the regions, along with the implementation of a health scheme for those returning to India for retirement, among other beneficial measures.

Dr. N K Pandey, Chairman & Managing Director, Asian Hospital, Faridabad said that they expecting to witness a robust policy shift that transcends traditional boundaries.

“Our Budget expectations include a substantial increase in the healthcare sector allocation, reflecting the government’s commitment to address critical health challenges particularly focus towards incommunicable disease. At the same time I think the government must also take steps to facilitate international collaborations to leverage global expertise and resources for healthcare advancements would align with the spirit of collective health progress. Furthermore, we expect to see a substantial focus to enhance accessibility of healthcare services in rural and small town India, with better infrastructure and high quality of medical facilities. We also expect to see continued focus on increased integration of AYUSH, as the acceptance of traditional medicine in holistic healthcare is growing,” Dr. Pandey said.

Meanwhile, Devlina Chakravarty, MD and CEO of Artemis Hospitals revealed that they expectations focus on key pillars: increasing public health expenditure to extend critical services nationwide, investing in cutting-edge medical education and research for a skilled workforce, advocating for affordability through tax breaks on health insurance and widened government coverage, and nurturing innovation in medical technology.

“We are optimistic about the government’s commitment to healthcare improvement, trusting in positive measures for accessible, affordable, and high-quality healthcare. A healthier population is the foundation of productivity and prosperity. The upcoming budget has the potential to reshape India’s healthcare landscape positively, and we eagerly anticipate transformative advances in ensuring the health and well-being of all citizens,” he said.

Dr. Bhupesh Singh, Senior Ophthalmologist & Director, Bharti Eye Hospitals said that the health sector is optimistic about strategic tax reforms that could propel the industry forward. The extension of eligibility for weighted deductions to companies under the new tax regime stands out as a potential catalyst for substantial investment in healthcare research and development.

“This extension would be a progressive step, aligning with the government’s vision of fostering innovation and making India a hub for medical breakthroughs. In addition, there’s a strong call for clarity and expansion of the Input Tax Credit (ITC) scheme to include expenses related to medical practitioners. Such a move would alleviate the financial strain on healthcare providers, enabling them to allocate resources more efficiently towards patient care and services. The implementation of this measure would be a testament to the government’s commitment to bolstering the healthcare sector’s capabilities. It is a critical time for such interventions, which could decisively shape the future of healthcare delivery in India and reinforce the nation’s resilience against health crises,” Dr. Singh said.

Some experts are also expecting an expansion of the medical value tourism.

Abrarali Dalal, Director & CEO, Sahyadri Hospitals Pvt Ltd. said that they foresee major advancements in strengthening the hospital and healthcare industry, with a particular emphasis on the core competencies of Home and Transit Care Services and the rapidly expanding field of Medical Value Tourism.

“As a quaternary care hospital, we would also welcome expansion of health insurance coverage to include modern treatments, promoting research and innovation with policy support, and increasing awareness of digital healthcare benefits. The capital should be directed towards providing modern, cutting-edge healthcare services to rural populations in order to close the gap that exists between urban and rural areas. A budget set aside for these initiatives will not only raise the bar and make healthcare more accessible to the impoverished, but it would also push our nation to the forefront of the medical value tourism sector. We anticipate a healthcare ecosystem with focused investment that supports an infrastructure that is cheap and accessible to all, regardless of location, and prioritises high-quality, sustainable treatment. The forthcoming budget presents an opportunity for the government to demonstrate its commitment to a robust, inclusive, and future-forward healthcare system,” Dalal said.

Dilip Jose, Managing Director & CEO, Manipal Hospitals pointed out that healthcare sector is to be perceived as an ecosystem.

“While delivery of care is at the core, it is closely intertwined with other facets like nutrition, sanitation, safe drinking water, reduction in pollution, primary education, etc to name a few. The Government has been viewing it from that perspective, especially with wellness and prevention of disease as the focus. Therefore, the expectation from the Budget is for continuity of that framework and adequate focus as well as funding support for all components of the ecosystem to ensure that we progress on the goals of prevention and wellness,” Jose said.

Gautam Khanna, CEO, P.D. Hinduja Hospital & Medical Research Centre, Mumbai revealed that India faces both unique challenges and un-paralleled opportunities in the healthcare sector. The upcoming budget must allocate the resources to drive India towards an inclusive digital health system, Khanna said.

“While the government’s initiatives over the past couple of years like ABPMJAY, ABDHM, focus on telemedicine and enhancing healthcare infrastructure have been commendable, a lot still needs to be done. India has one of the lowest public health expenditures relative to GDP in the world. While India’s population has grown nearly 15 per cent over the last decade, this growth has not been complimented by an equitable growth in healthcare spending. The upcoming budget should focus on increasing healthcare expenditure aiming for 2.5 to 3.5 percent of the total GDP in order to move closer towards universal health coverage,” he said.

Every year, roughly 5.8 million Indians succumb to heart and lung diseases, stroke, cancer and diabetes. Preventive health check-ups can help in early diagnosis and timely treatment of NCDs, hence lowering complications, mortality and burden on secondary and tertiary care facilities. Incentivising health insurance and preventive healthcare will play a pivotal role in this regards.

According to Khanna, expediting the implementation of measures announced in the previous budgets to enhance the public healthcare and medical education facilities in the country is critical. Further, to bridge the gigantic demand vs supply gap, the government should consider providing tax incentives for Healthcare Skill Development initiatives.

“A robust infrastructure backed by technology will be the backbone of delivering quality healthcare for all. As healthcare was introduced in the harmonised master list of Infrastructure sub sectors by RBI in 2012, long term financing options (as available to other sectors accorded infrastructure status), should be made available to healthcare also, in some form or the other. Other provisions such as depreciation for investments made for creating diagnostic infrastructure, incentivizing infrastructure creation and ease of doing business for the private sector would help fortify the infrastructural transformation for the sector. This financial support will also help in creating an attractive environment for domestic production of medical equipment, devices and consumables as well as catalyzing research and development. With this regard introducing either Zero rating GST to the health care sector with Input Tax credit, or bringing the healthcare sector under 5% GST with Input Tax credit, will help,” he said.

Digital healthcare, including Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, can contribute significantly towards making healthcare more accessible and affordable in the country, Khanna claimed. Tax incentives on technology investments and setting up ecosystems to aid the development of innovative digital healthcare delivery models suited for Indian healthcare would help in fuelling this transformation, he added.

“As India envisions becoming the medical tourism hub of the world, policy to ease the facilitation by Indian embassies abroad, insurance recognition for Indian providers, one stop welcome desk at airports, etc. will boost Medical tourism in India. This budget presents an opportunity to strengthen India’s healthcare sector foundation, catalyse growth and move towards being a more resilient & self-reliant nation,” he added.

Jasdeep Singh, Group CEO, CARE Hospitals Group said that the government could consider enhancing the budget for the healthcare industry. “The increased budget allocations can improve accessibility and affordability to people not just in Tier I cities, but also in Tier II and Tier III cities. Simplifying and making fairer taxes, specifically reforming GST, can contribute to this goal. The government could also consider a framework to focus on healthcare insurance, medical supplies and equipment, telemedicine, and medical tourism sectors of the healthcare industry,” Singh said.

Singh also revealed that there is a critical need for focused attention on hospital infrastructure.

“While hospitals delivered essential and high-quality treatment during the pandemic, the prevailing circumstances underscored the inadequacies in facilities, particularly a glaring shortage of beds and treatment options, especially in non-metro cities. Consequently, the government must prioritize enhancing infrastructure, especially in non-metro areas, ensuring that individuals can readily access healthcare when required. This initiative will not only benefit local communities but also contribute to the overall improvement of healthcare services on a global scale,” he said.

Allocating funds for training and development programs for healthcare providers, such as doctors and nurses, is essential. This will enhance their skills and contribute to better healthcare outcomes.

“2024 could be a promising year for the healthcare sector. We are hoping the government is going to consider the healthcare industry as a focus in this year’s union budget,” he added.

Yatharth Tyagi, Director, Yatharth Group of Hospitals said that they expect an enhanced healthcare spend of 2.5% of GDP to expand access and infrastructure.

“Backed by technology and innovation, schemes promoting medical tourism and digitization can position India as a healthcare hub for the world, creating jobs for our youth. Progress on GST for affordable equipment and nil rates on essential services will drive affordable treatment measures and inclusivity in healthcare. Increased budgetary incentives for private players to strengthen healthcare in aspirational districts will actualize the motto of “Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas.” Quality healthcare for all is integral for citizens to contribute meaningfully for national development. The pandemic put the spotlight on healthcare as vital for India’s self-reliance and economy. This budget must unite public and private stakeholders to increase expenditure across the value chain. By investing in preventive healthcare and universal coverage fueled by medical education and jobs, we can build a future-ready sector while uplifting lives. Healthcare for all will actualize the vision of an equitable India leading global welfare,” Tyagi said.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-hospital-industry-demands-increase-in-budget-allocation-scaling-up-healthcare-workers-and-strategic-tax-reforms-3371687/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024 Expectations: How can Budget bring parity in taxation? Here are likely changes,"With the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman all set to present the interim Budget 2024, ICRA has predicted a number of changes in terms of taxation, pension and insurance schemes, mutual fund schemes, among other things. This would be Nirmala Sitharaman’s sixth consecutive budget since 2019. Other than Nirmala Sitharaman, other finance ministers who have presented at least five consecutive Union Budget include Morarji Desai, P Chidambaram, Pranab Mukherjee, Manmohan Singh, Yashwant Sinha, and Arun Jaitley.

Budget 2024 Stocks to Focus: Union Budget 2024 Impact on Share Market Today



Being an interim Budget, while it is said to have no major announcements as it is coinciding with the general elections year which is scheduled for early this year, ICRA summarises the following changes/ announcements expected from the Budget document. The full budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 will be presented after the formation of the new government following the general elections.

Taxation

In terms of taxation, ICRA said that the markets have had the demand for removal of security transaction tax (STT) for a few years now and as the GST collection went up, this demand has again gained traction. The move, it said, will attract more investors to invest in domestic equity markets. Further, it added that the company pays tax on its profit and at the same time the government levies tax on dividends in the hands of shareholders resulting in double taxation on dividends. Thus, a relief from double taxation on dividends will be appreciated by the markets.

Pension and Insurance

The government, ICRA said, may consider raising the pension floor for the unorganised sector workers under its flagship scheme, the Atal Pension Yojana (APY) as the current amount may not attract enough potential subscribers to enroll. Furthermore, senior citizens rely heavily on annuity income during retirement years. Considering the rise in medical expenses and the financial well being of senior citizens, the government may accord tax-free status to annuity income from NPS. Also, an investment of Rs 50,000 a year is unlikely to yield much pension and the limit may be enhanced to Rs 1 lakh. Also, the government may look at separating tax deduction for life insurance premium instead of clubbing it under Section 80C which will improve the penetration of insurance products in the country and encourage people to secure their family’s financial future by investing in life insurance. Also, the ICRA report said that the government may reconsider the 18 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) charged on health insurance policies.

Mutual Funds

In terms of mutual funds, ICRA said, the government may consider addressing the difference in tax treatment between equity mutual funds and Unit linked Insurance Plan (ULIP). Also, an equity Fund of Fund needs to be at par with equity-oriented mutual funds for taxation. Further, it also bet on the simplification of capital gains structure by introducing a uniform holding period across domestic equities and mutual funds. Uniformity in tax treatment is expected to encourage higher compliance. However, it needs to be noted that equity investors take higher risks than other investors and hence the same needs to be taken care of accordingly. Further, the tax amendment to the Finance Bill last year created a level playing field between bank deposits and debt mutual funds. However, an investor in fixed deposits pockets assured returns irrespective of interest rate movements while a debt fund investor is exposed to not only interest rate risk, but credit risk as well in case the issuer defaults. Also, with the removal of earlier indexation benefits, global equity funds, equity fund of funds, gold funds and hybrid funds holding less than 35 per cent in equities turned out to be tax-unfriendly and suffered collateral damage. Thus, the tax change might be revisited.

Markets

Markets, ICRA said, seek a more comprehensive policy on crypto currency regulation.A

regulatory framework may result in a more inclusive participation in the crypto market. Also, the stage is set for sovereign green bonds to make a comeback in the Budget as green bonds address the funding requirements for wind, power and hydropower sector. And finally, a mega capital outlay may be earmarked for energy transition and net-zero objectives. Government is expected to focus on new-age fuels — green hydrogen, ethanol, and other biofuels.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-how-can-budget-bring-parity-in-taxation-here-are-likely-changes-3371272/

financialexpress.com,Crafting the future: a visionary prelude to the Budget 2024,"By Naman Jain

As we stand on the cusp of a new fiscal year, the anticipation surrounding the Union Budget 2024 is palpable, there lies an unparalleled opportunity to redefine the landscape of education in India. The foundation of any thriving nation is its education system, and thus, the upcoming budget holds the key to fostering a robust and dynamic learning environment. For all of us invested in the realm of education, this is a moment of significant importance. It’s not just about numbers and allocations, it’s about the transformative power that a well-thought-out budget can have on the future of our students and the nation.

The recent shifts in educational paradigms demand a proactive approach. An increased allocation towards technology integration, teacher training programmes and infrastructural enhancements is not merely an investment in schools but a visionary step towards nurturing the intellectual capital of our nation. It’s time to recognise the pivotal role of private institutions in shaping the educational ecosystem and incentivise their efforts through strategic policy measures. The challenges posed by the ongoing global situation underline the urgency for a resilient and adaptive education system.



In this digital age, the potential of technology to revolutionise education cannot be overstated. The upcoming budget must prioritise substantial investments in digital infrastructure for schools. This isn’t just about access, it’s about creating an ecosystem where every student, irrespective of their location, can harness the power of digital learning. A well-funded digital framework can be the catalyst for democratising education. Affordable digitization emerges as a linchpin for realising the vision of a Digital India. The budget should offer reliefs on the purchase of computing devices, laptops, and software to foster digital inclusion at all levels. This budget is not just about financial allocations, it is about laying the foundation for a future-ready and globally competitive education system that aligns with the aspirations of a new India.

In a rapidly evolving landscape, the focus on skill development is paramount. The budget must propose the establishment of more skill development centres to meet the demand for a skilled workforce in critical areas like mathematics, computer science, and data science. The unsung heroes of our education system are undoubtedly our teachers. They are the architects of our future. A significant chunk of the budget should be dedicated to empowering our educators. Comprehensive teacher training programs can equip them with the tools to navigate the evolving landscape of education, ensuring that they are well-prepared to guide our students towards success.

Education is not just about textbooks and exams. It’s about shaping individuals who are ready to face the complexities of the world. Our curriculum should reflect this reality. Let’s advocate for a more diversified approach that includes skill development, vocational training, and ample room for extracurricular activities. A holistic education, encompassing both knowledge and life skills, is the key to nurturing well-rounded individuals. It presents an occasion to prioritise mental health initiatives, revitalise vocational education, and fortify our commitment to inclusivity.

The bedrock of any thriving education system is quality and accountability. The budget must outline measures to ensure universal access to quality education across all levels, fostering equity and inclusion. A commitment to these objectives will empower students to not merely survive but thrive within the education system, contributing to a more robust and knowledgeable society. The public and private sectors should join hands to create a transformative educational landscape. Collaborations between the government and private institutions can bring in diverse perspectives, resources, and expertise. This synergy can result in the development of model schools that set the standard for excellence, inspiring institutions across the country.

In the age of climate change, our education system must reflect our commitment to sustainability. Integrating environmental education into the curriculum and adopting eco-friendly practices in school infrastructure are steps in the right direction. It’s about instilling a sense of responsibility towards the environment in our students. We need a budget that recognizes and rewards educational institutions for adopting innovative approaches. Incentive programs can spur a culture of experimentation and improvement, ensuring that our education system remains dynamic and adaptive to change.

Amidst the budgetary considerations for the education sector, a critical spotlight on the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a transformative force. AI has the potential to revolutionise the learning landscape, offering personalised and adaptive approaches that cater to individual student needs. Allocating resources for the development and implementation of AI-powered tools can enhance the quality of education, providing insights into student performance, enabling data-driven decision-making, and fostering a technologically advanced and responsive educational ecosystem. As we navigate the waves of change, embracing AI in education becomes not just a necessity but a strategic investment in preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of the future. The budget should echo the importance of AI integration, signalling a commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technologies for the advancement of India’s education sector.



The Union Budget 2024 is not just about financial allocations, it’s about crafting the future of our nation. Every decision made in this budget has the potential to shape the destinies of countless individuals. Let this budget be a testament to our dedication to creating a future-ready generation that can navigate complexities and contribute meaningfully to the nation’s progress. Let us hope that the budget reflects a commitment to a progressive, inclusive, and sustainable educational system – one that equips our students not just for exams but for life. The journey toward a brighter future begins here.

The developer community is keenly awaiting the budget announcements while expressing their key demands which, if fulfilled, will help further shape the sector’s trajectory in the upcoming fiscal year.

S K Narvar, Group Chairman, Trident Realty, says, “The budget should include a fiscal stimulus and personal tax relief by increasing the tax rebate on home loan interest rates from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. This will be a significant boost for millions of first-time homebuyers. In addition, the industry hopes that the government will address long-standing demands such as single window clearance and granting industry status to the real estate sector. If real estate is given industry status, developers will have easier access to loans with lower interest rates and easy financing options from institutional investors. This will be a great incentive for the developer community.”



He further says, “Another key area for the government to consider in the Union Budget is to continue focusing on Tier 2 & Tier 3 cities and to provide more infra development funds to ensure that a larger number of projects in these cities benefit. The government should consider revising the definition of affordable housing, both in terms of value and size, to cater to a large population that has returned to their hometown and to boost housing demand in new markets.”

The sector emphasizes the pivotal role of government support in sustaining the positive trajectory observed in 2023. Developers emphasize the need for the government to introduce incentives focused on lowering prices for first-time homebuyers, thus enhancing accessibility to homeownership for a broader demographic.

Santosh Agarwal, Executive Director and CFO, Alphacorp, says, “We are anticipating a growth-oriented budget where real estate thrives as a cornerstone of progress with policies that nurture sustainable development, incentivize innovation, and foster the housing segment with significant tax breaks. The Indian real estate industry rose massively in 2023 with a slew of projects, be it residential or commercial. Maintaining similar optimism, we await the Union Budget with the provisions for the single window clearance system for greater transparency and efficiency.”

The commercial real estate sector is experiencing increased demand, driven by economic growth and positive market sentiments. The surge is attributed to innovative office concepts, pro-business initiatives, and the provision of high-quality amenities.

To further propel the commercial segment growth and drive investment, Aman Trehan, Executive Director of Trehan Iris, highlights key points and says, “The realty sector expects the upcoming Union Budget to strengthen a conducive policy framework for enhancing business operations and pulling in more foreign investors. For the commercial segment comprising office space, retail, and mall developments, the government must extend holistic support. The developer community is urging the government to facilitate project financing by directing RBI to reduce interest rates on project finance. Additionally, a grant of industry status to the sector would enable developers to obtain financing at lower rates.”

He adds, “To promote growth in the office space segment, start-ups, MSMEs, and entrepreneurship need to be supported. The budget should continue emphasizing measures to encourage consumer spending and investment to strengthen the retail space segment.”

As the sector awaits the Finance Minister’s announcement, there is hope that the budget will act as a catalyst, further reinforcing the vital role of the real estate sector in India’s economic landscape.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/union-budget-2024-developers-seek-budget-boost-for-real-estate-3369663/

Here is what India Inc has to say on Budget 2024 Expectations…

Anghsu Mallick, Managing Director and CEO, Adani Wilmar

The FMCG sector is optimistic and looks forward to a market that is less volatile in 2024. The expectations from the upcoming Union Budget 2024 continue to be progressive, as we eagerly anticipate many transformative measures from it. The annual budget also offers a timely opportunity to set the direction for sustainable growth and empowerment, especially in the rural sector. Rural demand has been slower than expected. Inflation has hit consumption. With the higher expectation of the Rabi crop harvest, we anticipate rural demand to pick up. We recognise the vital role rural economies play in India’s economic growth and emphasize the need to introduce measures that would further boost consumption in these areas. New policies are anticipated that safeguard the interests of oilseed farmers and the oleochemical industry while effectively addressing challenges faced by rural communities. This, in turn, will have a positive ripple effect on industries connected with rural landscapes. The thrust on capital expenditure would be welcomed, as it not only spurs economic growth but also ensures inclusive development.

A level playing field for manufacturers could be achieved by categorizing imports like palm oil, stearic acid, soap noodles, oleic acid, and refined glycerin under the restricted-items list or implementing a 25 per cent import duty on finished products as opposed to raw materials. Additionally, the suggestion is to grant duty-free import privileges for raw materials to entities equipped with processing facilities. This move is expected to stimulate innovation and boost competitiveness, thus promoting the Make in India movement.

The proposed focus on bolstering investments in the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) and digital public infrastructure aligns with the ever-evolving landscape of consumer behavior, ensuring our industry stays ahead in the digital age.

Kami Viswanathan, President – MEISA, FedEx Express

FedEx advocates for a strategic allocation towards infrastructure development for more efficient multimodal logistics. Additionally, we emphasize a focus on digitization in the logistics sector to accelerate speed and ease of doing business.

Recognizing the impact of the National Logistics Policy and PM Gati Shakti National Master plan, alongside prioritizing road, sea, and rail cargo infrastructure, we see the expansion of airports as exciting avenues for growth. We urge a consistent budgetary emphasis on expanding airport infrastructure for cargo, strengthening regional airports and developing dedicated transhipment hubs to optimize belly and freight capacities. We underscore the importance of digitally advancing customs clearance processes through cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, and big data. This approach promises improved risk management, compliance, efficiency, and analytics.

As India targets lowering of logistics costs and a top 25 global rank by 2030, we anticipate budget initiatives that will sustainably boost manufacturing and trade, particularly benefiting and incentivizing SMEs. We also anticipate initiatives towards greater trade facilitation and further fostering a business-friendly environment aligning with the USD 5 trillion economy goal.

Anil G Verma, CEO and Executive Director, Godrej & Boyce

We expect the Government to continue its support to capex led projects, infrastructure improvements and PLIs, as budgeted. Further, the Government must take steps to accelerate the growth of its rural economy by providing suitable enablers. Additionally, the spends on targeted welfare measures for the underprivileged need to continue. India needs to grow across all segments and strata of society.

Arun Misra, CEO, Hindustan Zinc Limited

India’s Amrit Kaal presents a pivotal opportunity for sustainable growth. As industry leaders, we see potential in unlocking infrastructure development, industrial expansion, and a greener future. Optimizing mining holds key benefits.

Exploration is crucial for sustainable development. The total land mass of our county is 32.87 lakh Sq Km while the obvious geological potential area explored by GSI is 6.88 lakh Sq.Km only 2 per cent of OGP (obvious geological potential) has been taken to production level. The upcoming budget could encourage exploration by facilitating approvals and incentivizing experienced agencies as this segment holds huge potential for private industry to explore the mineral potential of India. Streamlining community development efforts is essential and with respect to that we urge the budget to look at consolidating DMF and CSR funds into a single entity that could simplify administration and maximize impact.

Mining infrastructure needs modernizing to maintain global competitiveness. Import duty relaxations on essential machinery and incentives for sustainable mining technologies could benefit both production and exports. Further proposals include royalty adjustments to incentivize exploration, exploring beyond mining leases to diversify resources, and leveraging mine tailings for resource efficiency. The zinc industry anticipates increased infrastructure projects driving demand for this durable and sustainable material. Implementing Production Linked Incentives for downstream metal processing could create jobs, empower technological advancements, and contribute to India’s economic goals.

Vineet Nayar, Former CEO of HCL Technologies and Founder, Chairman, Sampark Foundation

In the Union Budget 2024, the Indian government must prioritize AI integration in education to align with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. NEP’s goal of 6 per cent GDP allocation to education is a step towards educational revolution, but true transformation lies in embracing AI. AI can personalize learning, making it inclusive and effective. Strategic funding should support AI-driven educational models, digital infrastructure, and AI literacy. Such initiatives must extend beyond conventional classrooms, ensuring equitable access across socio-economic strata.

The Union Budget 2024 should not only increase allocation but strategically channel resources for AI embedding in education. This step will realize NEP’s vision and prepare India for an AI-dominated future, balancing technological advancement with social sector imperatives.

Manish Aggarwal, Director, Bikano, Bikanervala Foods Pvt Ltd

As we eagerly await the Union Budget for 2024-25, the FMCG industry in India is hopeful for a positive change after a tough 2023. Despite facing challenges in 2023, the sector expects to see strong growth next year, driven by increased demand in rural areas, favorable prices for raw materials, and the likelihood of a good monsoon.

We are eagerly anticipating the government’s focus on agriculture in the upcoming budget. This holds significance for the growth of rural areas, the potential for increased income in rural areas, and overall business expansion. The possibility of additional funding for the Agriculture Accelerator Fund aligns with our goal of utilizing new technology to improve farming practices, particularly enhancing storage facilities. This could contribute to better storage solutions, benefiting farmers and the overall FMCG sector.

Furthermore, we strongly encourage the government to invest adequately in boosting the rural economy. By enhancing the conditions for rural jobs and increasing government spending, we can stimulate greater demand in rural areas.

As we eagerly anticipate potential government efforts to uplift the FMCG industry, we also foresee a heightened focus of technology integration. This integration is expected to propel the FMCG sector forward by creating innovative approaches to connect with consumers and streamline operations.

Mahesh Gupta, Chairman, Kent RO Systems

As the budget approaches, the Consumer Durables industry expresses key expectations for policy considerations. Urging a reduction in GST on essential and aspirational appliances to 12 per cent or 5 per cent, the industry seeks to enhance affordability and drive growth across income levels. Emphasizing the need for reinforced support to the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and the Make in India initiative, tax breaks for raw materials, components, and machinery upgrades are highlighted to fortify domestic manufacturing and generate employment opportunities.

Infrastructure development is a critical aspect, with a call for resources to ensure a reliable power supply and efficient logistics networks. Encouraging the use of automation is seen as pivotal for reducing costs and improving competitiveness in the business environment.

Innovation takes center stage, with the industry calling for substantial funds for research and development (R&D) in energy efficiency, smart features, and sustainability to secure global market leadership. Addressing human capital needs, there’s an emphasis on skill development initiatives and industry-academia partnerships to upskill the workforce.

Additionally, the industry advocates for regulatory streamlining to lower transaction costs and enhance the ease of doing business. Lastly, there’s a plea for tax incentives promoting sustainable practices, aligning with global environmental goals and making sustainability a competitive advantage.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-what-india-inc-expects-from-interim-budget-3369207/
financialexpress.com,"Interim Budget 2024 Expectations: Govt to target fiscal deficit at 5.3% of GDP for FY2025, says ICRA","With the the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman all set to present the interim Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 on February 1, 2024, an analysis by ICRA suggested that the government is likely to target fiscal deficit at 5.3 per cent of GDP for FY2025, entailing a reasonable degree of fiscal consolidation amid slower capex growth.

Budget 2024 Income Tax Live Updates: Income Tax Slab Rate Change Budget 2024 Live Updates

Budget 2024 Stocks to Focus: Union Budget 2024 Impact on Share Market Today



The upcoming Budget will be an interim one and is said to have no major announcements as it is coinciding with the general elections year which is scheduled for this year. The full budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 will be presented after the formation of the new government following the general elections. The Budget is allotted for the upcoming fiscal year, which runs from 1st April to 31st March of the next year.



However, the expansion in the Government of India’s (GoI’s) capex and the extent of fiscal consolidation would be scrutinised closely, given the implications for growth and G-sec yields, respectively. ICRA expects the fiscal deficit target for FY2025 to be set at 5.3 per cent of GDP, midway through the expected print of 6.0 per cent for FY2024 and the medium-term target of sub-4.5 per cent by FY2026. “This, along with our projection of an appreciable dip in the revenue deficit, would allow for a capex target of Rs 10.2 trillion for FY2025, 10 per cent higher than the expected level for FY2024 vis-à-vis the 20 per cent-plus YoY expansion seen during FY2021-FY2024. A higher capex target would impinge on the GoI’s ability to bridge half the required fiscal consolidation in FY2025, thereby making the task of reaching medium-term fiscal deficit target by FY2026 even more challenging,” ICRA said in a report.

What are the expectations from Interim Budget for FY24

Per a report by ICRA, the GoI’s revenue receipts are likely to exceed the FY2024 Budget Estimate (BE) by ~Rs 0.5 trillion, largely driven by the overshooting in net tax and non-tax revenues. On the expenditure side, it said that the total spending is expected to remain largely in line with the FY2024 BE of Rs 45.0 trillion, with a lower-than budgeted capital expenditure partially offsetting the projected overshooting in revenue expenditure (by +Rs. 800 billion) vis-à-vis the budgeted target for the fiscal.

Further, it said that the fiscal deficit is unlikely to overshoot the FY2024 BE of Rs 17.9 trillion. However, a lower nominal GDP number than what the Union Budget had pencilled in (NSO’s first advance estimates: Rs 296.6 trillion vs. FY2024 BE: Rs 301.8 trillion), is likely to result in the fiscal deficit printing at 6.0 per cent of GDP. This, along with the robust inflows into small savings schemes, suggest that the GoI’s market borrowings are likely to remain in line with the budgeted amount for FY2024 (gross: Rs 15.4 trillion; net: Rs 11.8 trillion).

What are the expectations from Interim Budget for FY25

Given the favourable macroeconomic backdrop and expectations of the benign domestic environment sustaining in the next fiscal, per the analysis by ICRA, the GoI is expected to continue on the fiscal consolidation path in the Union Budget for FY2025. However, it added that this is likely to entail a slower expansion in capex vis-à-vis that seen in the post-Covid years, which could weigh on the growth in economic activity. Additionally, with the upcoming Budget set to be an interim one for the purpose of a vote-on-account, major policy changes and announcements are unlikely at this juncture, it said.

“We expect the GoI’s gross tax revenues (GTR) to grow by a healthy 11 per cent in FY2025, led by direct taxes and GST collections, even as the growth in excise and customs duty collections is likely to be subdued,” it said.

The disinvestment target is likely to be pegged at sub-Rs 500 billion for FY2025. Given the uncertainties involved in market transactions, it would be prudent to set a moderate target of sub-Rs 500 billion for FY2025, instead of a higher aim that may disrupt the budget math if there is a large shortfall in such receipts by the end of the fiscal, based on the past year trends.

Furthermore, ICRA expects the revenue expenditure to increase by a modest ~4 per cent in FY2025, led by a moderate growth in interest payments amid a slight moderation in allocation for subsidies and a continued focus on curtailment of other expenses. It added, “We estimate the GoI to budget for a capex of Rs 10.2 trillion in FY2025, implying a relatively sedate YoY expansion of ~10 per cent, compared to over 20 per cent expansion seen in each of post-Covid years. The slowdown in capex growth is likely to have some bearing on economic activity and GDP growth.”

As already mentioned above, ICRA expects the GoI to target a fiscal deficit of 5.3 per cent of GDP in FY2025, midway through the expected print of 6.0 per cent in FY2024 and the medium-term target of 4.5 per cent for FY2026.



For FY2025, the 15th Finance Commission (FC) had recommended a normal borrowing limit of 3.0 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for the state governments. Given this and ICRA’s expectations of the GoI’s fiscal deficit, the General Government deficit is likely to dip to 8.3 per cent of GDP in FY2025 from 9.2 per cent of GDP expected in FY2024. This would be the lowest level of the General Government deficit since FY2020 (7.2 per cent of GDP).

Net General Government dated market borrowings for FY2025 are pegged to rise to Rs 18.6 trillion, marginally higher than the Rs 18.5 trillion projected for FY2024. With larger redemptions of G-sec and SGS, gross borrowings are estimated to rise by 2.1 per cent to Rs 25.5 trillion in FY2025 from the projected Rs 25.0 trillion in FY2024. Overall, largely stable market borrowings, along with inflows on account of bond index inclusion, are expected to augur well for yields, ICRA said.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/interim-budget-2024-expectations-govt-to-target-fiscal-deficit-at-5-3-of-gdp-for-fy2025-says-icra-3367862/

Expectations from Budget 2024

The real estate industry in India is at the cusp of keen anticipation as Budget 2024 looms on the horizon, especially in the midst of an election year. One of the foremost expectations from Budget 2024 revolves around the revision of the maximum deduction for home loan interest under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act.

Currently capped at Rs 2 lakh, industry experts advocate for a substantial increase, proposing a new limit of at least Rs 5 lakh. This adjustment is seen as pivotal, particularly in rejuvenating the budget housing segment, which has witnessed a decline in demand. The augmentation of this deduction has the potential to infuse renewed vigor into the market, encouraging prospective homebuyers to invest in affordable housing options.

Additionally, stakeholders are anticipating the introduction of additional tax deductions tailored for first-time homebuyers. Envisaged benefits for new homeowners are expected to not only make property acquisition more attractive but also serve as a catalyst for reinvigorating the overall housing market. These incentives are viewed as strategic measures to enhance homeownership, fostering a conducive environment for sustained growth.

In addition, there is a collective hope within the industry for the extension or enhancement of tax benefits for affordable housing loans and projects. With the current benefits set to expire in March 2024, the continuation or expansion of these incentives could significantly bolster the government’s ongoing initiatives in the affordable housing domain. Such support aligns with the broader national objective of ensuring housing affordability and accessibility, addressing the critical need for shelter across diverse demographic segments.

Potential Impact on Homebuyers

With strong expectations and speculations circulating, particularly concerning tax rebates and home loan interest rates, stakeholders are keenly assessing the potential impact on homebuyers and the broader real estate market.

The proposed increase in the maximum deduction for home loan interest under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act, from the existing limit of Rs 2 lakh to a suggested Rs 5 lakh, is anticipated to have a profound effect. This adjustment is viewed as a positive catalyst, potentially revitalizing the budget housing segment, which has experienced a decline in demand.

Simultaneously, the prospect of additional tax deductions for first-time homebuyers is expected to present new opportunities for prospective homeowners. By stimulating the housing market through targeted incentives, this measure could foster increased homeownership and contribute to a more vibrant real estate landscape.

As these proposed changes are analyzed, their potential impact on various segments of the real estate market becomes evident. The overarching goal is to enhance affordability and accessibility for a wider range of buyers, aligning with the industry’s commitment to serving diverse demographic segments.

Non-Budget Factors Affecting Home Loan Interest Rates

The real estate industry in India is intricately intertwined with the fiscal policies set by the government and the monetary measures administered by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). While the focus remains on the impending Budget 2024, it is crucial to acknowledge non-budgetary factors that exert a substantial influence on home loan interest rates.

Notable among these factors is the anticipated role of the RBI, with expectations for repo rate cuts in 2024. As the central bank navigates economic dynamics, the connection between these anticipated rate adjustments and subsequent lending rates from banks becomes paramount. The RBI’s strategic decisions are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the financial landscape for prospective homebuyers.

Potential reductions in home loan interest rates, albeit not directly tethered to the budget, are noteworthy. Anticipated repo rate cuts could translate into lower lending rates from banks, indirectly enhancing affordability for homebuyers. This indirect impact is poised to have far-reaching implications for both the real estate industry and individual homebuyers, creating an environment conducive to increased real estate transactions and market growth.

Conclusion

The real estate sector is on the brink of transformation, poised for positive outcomes in Budget 2024, with a recognition of the collaborative role played by government policies and central bank actions in shaping the housing market. Expectations center around amendments to tax rebates and home loan interest rates, with a proposed increase in the maximum deduction for home loan interest and additional benefits for first-time homebuyers.

These changes could spark a revival, particularly in the budget housing segment. While awaiting official announcements, the intertwined influence of government policies and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is crucial. Anticipated repo rate cuts by the RBI in 2024 might indirectly lower home loan interest rates, enhancing affordability for homebuyers.

While various measures have been taken by the Central and State governments in the country like the introduction of FAME subsidy, state policies, setting up of EV charging ecosystem, rolling out of Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, etc, the industry stakeholders are hoping to see some more steps from the government. Some of the expectations of industry captains include –

Naveen Munjal, MD, Hero Electric is hopeful to see a continued focus on long-term policy measures that promote EV adoption such as reduced GST rates, extension of FAME-II subsidies/introduction of FAME-III, and increased infrastructure spending for charging infrastructure. This will spark consumer confidence and will bridge the affordability gap. Additionally, promoting domestic battery manufacturing and skilling initiatives for the EV workforce will be vital for creating a robust and sustainable EV ecosystem in India.

Akshit Bansal, CEO & Founder, Statiq anticipates the government to align its policies with the net-zero goal and sustainable development. In particular, the implementation of Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes tailored for EV charging companies is of utmost importance. The growth of EV infrastructure plays a pivotal role in driving widespread EV adoption in India, and financial incentives will undoubtedly accelerate the expansion of our charging network. Moreover, looking forward to tax reformation that not only supports our industry but also encourages consumers to embrace electric vehicles. Circular economy measures should also find a prominent place in the budget, promoting recycling, waste reduction, and the use of eco-friendly materials in manufacturing.

Dr Lalit Singh, CEO of TelioEV hopes for continued support in the form of demand-side incentives, such as tax deductions for purchasers of electric vehicles and an extension of FAME-II subsidies. The development of a resilient EV charging ecosystem is of equal importance, especially in Tier II and Tier III cities, we urge the government to allocate substantial funds for the development of charging infrastructure. The open data standards and APIs for charging networks should be prioritised in the budget as this will encourage interoperability and nurture a thriving software ecosystem by providing EV drivers with seamless access to any station, irrespective of the provider.

“Additionally, we seek fiscal incentives such as tax rebates to support investments in R&D for software solutions that enable advanced charging. This will encourage innovation in areas like smart grid integration, dynamic pricing, and demand forecasting will optimise energy use and enhance charging efficiency.”

Nikhil Bhatia, Co-Founder & Chief Strategy Officer, HOP Electric Mobility: “Advocating for a streamlined Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, stakeholders seek clarity in provisions to encourage investment and growth. The call extends to widening the scope of the FAME II scheme, fostering innovation in diverse EV segments. A crucial focus lies on incentivising in-bound technology transfer and manufacturing capabilities, positioning India as a global EV technology hub. Anticipating the central role of lithium-ion batteries, we urge GST reform for increased cost competitiveness. Moreover, the promotion of universal battery charging and swapping infrastructure aims to simplify the user experience and standardise EV charging. The forthcoming budget is anticipated to lay the foundation for a sustainable, technology-driven future in Indian mobility, aligning with global EV trends.”

Sameer Aggarwal, CEO & Founder, Revfin Services: “Investing in renewable energy infrastructure is not just an environmental imperative; it’s an economic opportunity that can power our nation forward. In the drive towards a greener tomorrow, the government can catalyse change by incentivising renewable energy projects and R&D initiatives. By allocating resources to enhance solar and wind power capacities, we not only reduce our carbon footprint but also fortify our energy security. Crucially, as the electric vehicle revolution gains momentum, integrating renewable energy into the national grid becomes paramount. A strategic allocation in the budget for renewable energy will not only power homes but also fuel the burgeoning electric vehicle segment. By creating an ecosystem where clean energy sources power our transportation, we pave the way for a sustainable and resilient future.”

Mayank Bindal, Founder & CEO, Snap E Cabs: “There is a proposal to reduce the GST on the li-ion batteries from 18% to 5% overall, reducing the cost of acquiring EV’s. Since batteries are a major cost component in EV’s, the move to reduce the cost of batteries will make the product more lucrative for buyers. Over the past 5 years the government has focused a lot on building strong infrastructure. It is expected to continue improving and make efficient investments in energy, especially green energy and sustainable energy. The focus is on transitioning from carbon dependent to energy efficient policies. The new transport policies being adopted by the state govt is a testament to this shift. Many state transport authorities have announced the conversion of Petrol/Diesel cabs be converted into EV’s by the end of this decade. We look forward to EV financing getting priority sector lending status as the government’s ambitious target of 30% penetration to be achieved by 2023.”

Hari Kiran, Co-Founder and COO, eBikeGo: “As thе 2024 Budgеt approaches, the automotive industry eagerly awaits insights in the GST landscape, particularly for entry-level two-wheelers. Anticipation is around the potential FAME 3 scheme, PLI sops, and a revision of GST on electric two-wheeler. We hope for a continuation of grееn mobility еmphasis, building on the government’s understanding of thе symbiotic rеlationship bеtwееn еnvironmеntal sustainability and economic growth. Thе rеduction in customs duty on EV parts in thе prеvious budgеt spurrеd local manufacturing, and similar amendments are expected in thе 2024 budgеt. Calls for a uniform 5% GST on all EV spare parts, align with 5% GST on vehicles, which resonates with thе industry, as we aim for a more equitable tax structure.

Bharath Rao, Co-Founder / CEO, Emobi: “One of the foremost things that the industry is keenly expecting is the changes in the FAME 2 subsidies in the Union Budget 2024. This is one of the most significant aspects and the entire ecosystem is waiting to understand how the subsidy terms will be tweaked and extended. A significant trend which I foresee will bring a new twist to the market is the rise of battery swapping companies. Another aspect I urge the Government to consider is the difference in GST rates. Currently. EVs sold with included batteries have a 5% GST, while those sold without, especially for battery-swapping, face an 18% GST. Additionally, purchasing lithium batteries separately incurs an 18% GST, compared to the 5% GST when included in the EV purchase. This makes it difficult for companies investing in battery-swapping technology. The industry is looking forward to a budget that levels the playing field, encourages new ideas, and pushes the EV industry toward a sustainable and balanced future”.

Pragya Goyal, CEO & Co-Founder, Vegh Automobiles: “To capitalise on the momentum set out by the current government, the interim budget will need to take into account forging trade agreements that make exports more lucrative for companies seeking to diversify their production and emphasise bolstering the logistics sector. In light of the existing global constraints and monopolisation in the lithium supply chain, there is a pressing need for India to engage in research aimed at creating indigenous and cost-effective machinery and technology.”

Akihiro Ueda, CEO of Terra Motors: We anticipate the budget to introduce measures that will support this growth, such as incentives for EV production and infrastructure development. Cox Automotive’s forecast of new-vehicle sales reaching 15.6 million in 2024, with EVs making up over 10% of this, underscores the sector’s potential. We hope the budget will pave the way for more competitive pricing and increased EV adoption, aligning with our commitment to provide the masses with eco-friendly transportation solutions.

Nehal Gupta Director of AMU: “I am optimistic that the interim budget will be pretty positive for the auto financing sector, especially for EVs. With our government’s continuous drive to phase out conventional fuels like petrol and diesel and promote sustainable mobility, there is a high chance of getting an extension on the FAME-II subsidy for EV manufacturers. In this regard, I feel EV financing providers and fintech companies could benefit significantly, given the sector’s key role in supporting the masses to switch to electric vehicles. In fact, I firmly believe that now is the right time to grant Priority Sector Lending status to electric auto financing to help the nation meet its target of 30% electric vehicle penetration by 2030. Several financial institutions, including the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and IREDA, extend subsidised financing schemes for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, benefitting MSMEs, fleet owners, EV leasing companies, and aggregators. These institutions could further benefit from the Priority Sector Lending status, which will potentially increase their access to credit and enable them to stimulate rapid growth in the electric automobile sector that is not limited to only the established companies or segments of the industry.”

Sushant Kumar, MD, AMO Mobility: As we approach the 2024 budget, my perspective on the auto financing sector is one of cautious optimism mixed with a strategic focus. The challenges of 2023, particularly the higher interest rates and increased cost of financing, have taught us valuable lessons in resilience and adaptability. With the global automotive financing market expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.18% through 2031, the potential for expansion is undeniable. However, this growth hinges on the ability to adapt to the Federal Reserve’s anticipated interest rate adjustments in 2024. For the upcoming budget, the sector could see more policies that further support and accelerate the growth of the auto financing sector, particularly in the realm of electric vehicles, aligning with our commitment to a sustainable future. These changes could breathe new life into the auto loan segment, offering a much-needed boost to both lenders and borrowers. In this evolving landscape, I think sustainable lending practices should be prioritised while exploring innovative financing solutions that cater to the changing needs of consumers. The focus should be on balancing risk management with growth opportunities, ensuring that our sector not just recovers but thrives in the post-pandemic economy.”

Shubham Vishvakarma, Co-Founder and Chief of Process Engineering, Metastable Materials: “A large volume of India’s end-of-life lithium-ion batteries is exported globally for recycling or just processed as an intermediate black mass and then exported. Hence, massive R&D investments are required, particularly to create strong competencies and lab testing facilities for the proper end-of-life Lithium-ion battery recycling. This not only contributes to responsible environmentalism but also nurtures a talented pool of individuals. Another area, where we are hopeful for is the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) and it’s extension to battery recycling. This would also be a strategic approach as by expanding the range of the scheme beyond just the Advanced Chemistry Cell manufacturing, we open up the opportunity to capture the entire value chain. This extension will incentivize the setting up of homegrown recycling firms instead of shipping away the dead batteries. We also recommend that the recycling of lithium-ion batteries be incorporated into the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme. This inclusion, in particular for negative-value battery chemistries feasibility will provide substantial support to India’s position in the carbon credit markets and also demonstrates our continued dedication to sustainable solutions.”

Ashish Deswal, Founder, EarthtronEV: “In an environment of unprecedented growth, when global rating agencies like S&P foresee India as the world’s third-largest economy by 2030 and forecast 7 percent GDP growth in coming years, the industry is not just optimistic but ambitious as well to raise the bar on all fronts. So, with these positive sentiments, we expect the upcoming budget will motivate electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers and cab service providers with supportive policies. Incentives and relaxations for establishing EV charging hubs across India are also required to help the Union Government achieve its carbon emission target within a specific timeline. Charging infrastructure is a crucial component of the electric vehicle ecosystem. We are also optimistic that the finance minister will come up with incentives, subsidies, or tax breaks to encourage investment in EV charging infrastructure. This could include reduced taxes on equipment, customs duty exemptions, or other financial incentives. Also, the Union Budget 2024 is expected to be a turning point for the EV industry, with a GST cut expected to be 5 percent or nil on lithium-ion battery packs and cells, benefiting the EV sector, which is primarily reliant on batteries. we look forward to policy measures that simplify regulatory processes, provide a roadmap for infrastructure expansion, and address any barriers to entry or operation. Besides, we are hoping the government may allocate funds for R&D in the EV sector, including charging technology.”

Rajesh Gupta, Founder & Director, Recyclekaro: “The upcoming budget holds a pivotal role in steering India towards a sustainable future by fostering the growth of battery recycling. The circular economy’s cornerstone, battery recycling, addresses mineral scarcity and reinforces our supply chains, paving the way for self-sufficiency in battery materials. While regulations like the Electronics Waste Management Rule and Batteries Management Rule have strengthened the recycling industry, persistent challenges call for solutions. To further empower this sector, streamlined recycling policies and incentives for pioneering waste management solutions are imperative. The rapidly growing adoption of electric vehicles is a catalyst for the EV battery recycling industry. Initiatives such as FAME, PLI, and other incentives should be amplified to fuel this momentum. A tailored PLI scheme dedicated to lithium-ion battery recycling will be a game-changer, amplifying the sector’s growth while advancing India’s sustainability goals. As we approach the budget, investing in these strategic measures will not only invigorate the recycling industry but also cement India’s position as a global leader in sustainable practices.”",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-expectations-reduction-in-taxes-extension-of-fame-scheme-and-focus-on-charging-ecosystem-says-ev-stakeholders-3363279/
financialexpress.com,What individual taxpayers can expect from Budget 2024,"Budget 2023 was the last full-fledged Union Budget of the current government before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The Budget presented by the government on 1st February 2024 would be a ‘vote on account’. While no major announcements are expected, individual taxpayers have expectations on the same.

Some key expectations from the Budget 2024 from an individual taxpayer’s perspective are:

Change in tax slabs and rates

Tax slabs and tax rates have remained constant for a long time now. A new simplified tax regime was introduced in the Budget 2020 with lower tax rates if one forgoes certain deductions and exemptions. But there was no change in the regular tax rates for individuals. Last year, some changes were made to the tax slabs and tax rates under the new regime with an intention to popularise the same.



However, with the cost of living going up and loan interest rates rising, a relaxation in the income tax rates for individuals would be a welcome measure for individual taxpayers.



The highest effective income tax rate in India, including surcharge and cess, stands at 42.744% under the old tax regime and 39% under the new tax regime.

One of the main expectations by the common man is to increase the income threshold for the highest tax rate from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh and reduce the rate from 30% to 25%. To make the new tax regime attractive, the income tax rate could be 20% for income between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 20 lakh and 25% for income over Rs 20 lakh.

Increase in standard deduction

Standard deduction is a fixed deduction available to salaried individuals without the need for providing evidence of actual expenses incurred. Historically, this deduction was available for many years, but in 2005, this was removed only to be reintroduced in the 2018 Union Budget.

Although the standard deduction was initially set at INR 40,000 in the Budget 2018, it was later increased to INR 50,000 in the subsequent Budget, and there have been no further adjustments since then.

The current deduction of INR 50,000 is deemed insufficient to cover the escalating costs and expenses associated with the higher standard of living and thus there is a need to increase the standard deduction. This adjustment would also bring parity with individuals earning income from business or profession, who can claim actual expenses or opt for a presumptive basis of taxation, where a certain percentage of gross income is considered as an expense.

Moreover, post the pandemic, there has been an increase in medical costs, which should be factored in when considering an increase in the standard deduction. To address these concerns, the government could consider increasing the standard deduction to INR 100,000.

Deductions from income tax under old tax regime

There have been persistent expectations for some time now to raise the exemption limit on tax-saving investments under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (Act) to at least INR 2.5 lakh. The current limit of INR 1.5 lakh appears quite insufficient and has remained unchanged since fiscal year 2014-15. Considering the increased cost of living and inflation, the government should consider raising the limit under Section 80C of the Act.

Currently, Section 80C allows a deduction for tuition fees paid to any educational institution in India for up to two children, subject to the overall limit of Rs 1.5 lakh. As a result, the deduction is not fully utilised. Given escalating costs of education, it is time this deduction is treated separately, similar to medical insurance. Therefore, the government could likely contemplate introducing a distinct section to enable a deduction for education expenses.

In light of rising expenses for medical treatments, the cost of comprehensive insurances has surged significantly. Consequently, the existing limit of INR 25,000 (INR 50,000 for senior citizens) needs to be reconsidered and potentially increased to INR 50,000 (INR 1,00,000 for senior citizens).

Additionally, considering that salaried individuals are unlikely to keep all their savings in a single savings bank account, which typically earns a lower interest rate compared to term deposits, there may be the tendency to transfer a portion of savings to term/recurring deposits in banks for better returns. Therefore, the government can consider including the interest on various types of bank deposits (e.g., Fixed Deposits) within the scope of section 80TTA. Furthermore, the limit for this inclusion could be raised from INR 10,000 to INR 50,000.

Enabling tax payments from and refunds to the overseas bank accounts of the taxpayer

Currently, tax payments in India can be made through various modes such as net banking, debit cards, NEFT/RTGS, and over-the-bank counter. Recently, the options have been expanded to include a wide range of Indian banks, NEFT payments, RTGS payments and UPI payments. However, these options are limited to Indian banks, creating challenges for non-resident taxpayers who wish to make tax payments.

Likewise, non-residents, particularly foreign nationals, encounter difficulties in claiming refunds in their income-tax returns when they leave India after closing their Indian bank accounts. To address this issue, it is time that foreign bank accounts are considered for tax refunds, especially for PAN-holders registered as non-residents or foreign nationals.

E-verification using OTPs to foreign mobile numbers

Introduction of the verification process for tax returns and the filing of compliance forms, such as Form 67, has brought in efficiencies in terms of time and effort. However, this process has certain limitations, such as the requirement for specific means of verification, like having accounts with net banking/demat facilities with specified banks, Aadhaar OTPs sent to Indian mobile numbers, and digital signature certificates.

For non-resident individuals living outside India who need to complete the tax return filing process or file forms, there could be benefits if the e-verification process is extended to include OTPs sent to foreign mobile numbers or involves two-factor authentication (with different OTPs for foreign mobile numbers and email addresses). This extension could streamline the process, reduce paperwork and administrative tasks, such as tracking receipt by the tax office and applying for condonation of delays.

Enhancement of Annual Information Statement (AIS)

Currently, the AIS captures information related to various transactions, including those involving deducted or collected taxes, bank interest, dividends, sale and purchase of capital assets, foreign remittance, and refunds from the income tax department. This data is crucial for preparing tax returns. The AIS compiles information based on PAN to offer an overview of transactions under the PAN, but it does not encompass certain transactions that are relevant and reportable in the tax return.

To enhance the coverage of AIS, it is proposed to include additional transactions where the PAN is quoted, such as transactions involving the Employer Provident Fund, Public Provident Fund, National Pension Scheme, life and health insurance policies, as well as principal and interest on loan repayment.

This expansion would contribute to pre-filling the tax return with pertinent data, including details about applicable exemptions, deductions, and the taxability of withdrawal proceeds, providing a more comprehensive picture for tax reporting purposes.

While the upcoming Budget would be ‘vote on account’, it remains to be seen if any of the above expectations would see the light of the day on 1st February or if taxpayers would need to wait till the full-fledged Budget post elections, for the relief being sought by them.

financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: What is Vote on Account? Is it similar to an Interim Budget?,"In a year marked by Lok Sabha elections, the central government releases an interim Budget instead of a regular Union Budget. And the upcoming Budget to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2024 will be an interim Budget with the general elections expected to be held between March and May in 2024. An outgoing government presents only an interim Budget or seeks a vote on account, and leaves it to the next government to present the full Budget.

The Constitution says that no money can be withdrawn by the government from the Consolidated Fund of India except under appropriation made by law. And for this, an appropriation bill is passed during the Budget process which may take time to pass through he Parliament and become a law. Meanwhile, the government would require permission to spend money from April 1 when the new financial year starts. Vote on Account is that permission which the government seeks to withdraw money from the Consolidated Fund of India, during that period, which usually is two months. Essentially, vote on account is the interim permission of the parliament to the government to spend money, as against the full Budget which is an elaborate financial statement of expenditure and receipts including changes in taxes and government policies.



So, what really is Vote on Account and how is it different from the interim Budget?



As defined by Article 116 of the Indian Constitution, a vote on account is an advance grant to the government from the Consolidated Fund of India to cover short-term expenditure requirements until the new financial year begins. The Consolidated Fund of India, defined in Article 266 of the Constitution, stores all the revenue generated by the central government, and this includes taxes, interest on loans, and a portion of state taxes. It may not be withdrawn except under an appropriation undertaken by law and approved by the Centre each year during the Union Budget.

Vote on Account is the estimated expenditure that covers the expenses that are required before a new government takes charge. Similar to the fiscal document present in a regular budget year, it must receive the nod of the majority in the Parliament. A vote on account is merely an interim authorization to spend money, as opposed to a full Budget that includes details of expenditures and receipts, including tax changes and government policies.

While its very common to confuse the interim Budget and Vote on Account and to also use both the terms interchangeably, there are fundamental differences between the two. One major difference is that Vote on Account can’t impact the tax regime, whereas the interim Budget can change it. Also, an interim Budget consists of both expenditures and receipts whereas a vote on account lists only the expenditure borne by the government. An interim Budget has to be discussed in the Lok Sabha and then passed, and the vote on account deals specifically with expenditure and is passed by the Lok Sabha without any discussion. An interim Budget is similar to a full budget but only has projections for a few months whereas the vote on account can be passed through the interim budget. An interim Budget is valid for an entire year on the other hand a vote on account is usually valid for 2 months.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-what-is-vote-on-account-is-it-similar-to-an-interim-budget-3342213/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: Here are interesting facts about Budget over the years,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting the interim Budget for fiscal year 2024-25 on February 1, 2024. This would be her sixth consecutive budget since 2019. Other than Nirmala Sitharaman, other finance ministers who have presented at least five consecutive Union Budget include Morarji Desai, P Chidambaram, Pranab Mukherjee, Manmohan Singh, Yashwant Sinha, and Arun Jaitley. Being an interim Budget, it is said to have no major announcements as it is coinciding with the general elections year which is scheduled for early next year. The full budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 will be presented after the formation of the new government following the general elections. The Budget is allotted for the upcoming fiscal year, which runs from 1st April to 31st March of the next year.

While one fact about the upcoming Budget is it being an interim instead of a full Union Budget, here are some interesting facts about Budget presentation in the country:

First and foremost



India contains a 163-year old legacy of budget presentation in the country. The first budget in the country was introduced by James Wilson, a Scottish economist, on April 7, 1860, under the East India Company rule. Post-independence, the first Budget was presented on November 26, 1947 by then Finance Minister RK Shanmukham Chetty. There have been 75 annual budgets, 14 interim budgets and four special budgets, presented in the country since Independence.



The longest and shortest Budget speeches

The record for giving the longest speech was set by the current Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2020 when she presented the Union Budget for 2020-21 and spoke for two hours and forty-two minutes. During the speech, Nirmala Sitharaman beat her own previous record set in July 2019 when she delivered her first budget, speaking for 2 hours and 17 minutes. Now, the shortest Budget speech was delivered by Hirubhai Mulljibhai Patel in 1977, when he spoke just 800 words. He was the finance minister of India from 1977 to 1979 under Morarji Desai-led government.

Budget speech with most words

While we already talked about the longest and the shortest Budget speeches, in 1991, then finance minister Manmohan Singh, under Narasimha Rao government, delivered the longest Budget speech in terms of words, clocking in at 18,650 words. The second lengthiest speech was delivered by Arun Jaitley during his 2018 Budget speech which was a 18,604 words speech. Arun Jaitley took 1 hour and 49 minutes to complete his speech.

Most number of Budget presentations by a finance minister

Former prime minister Moraraji Desai, during his tenure as finance minister from 1962 to 1969, holds the record for submitting the most number of Budget proposals till now. Moraraji Desai presented 10 Budgets, followed by P Chidambaram with 9 Budget presentations, Pranab Mukherjee presenting 8 Budgets, Yashwant Sinha with 8 Budget presentations in his kitty, Manmohan Singh too presenting 8 Budgets, Arun Jaitley at 5 and Nirmala Sitharaman too at 5.

Budget presentation timing

In 1999, then Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha altered the timing of the Budget presentation to 11 am. During the colonial-era, the Budget used to be presented at 5 pm on the last working day of February. Again in 2017, then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley started the practice of presenting the Budget on February 1 instead of the last working day of the month.

Budget presentation by prime minister

While generally, the finance minister is tasked with presenting the Union Budget every year, there have been instances when it was presented by the prime minister of the country. Pandit Jawaharlal Lal Nehru was the first prime minister to present a Union Budget. In 1958, then Finance Minister TT Krishnamachari resigned due to his alleged involvement in the Haridas Mundhra scandal, and so, Pandit Nehru had to present the Union Budget. Again in 1970, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi presented the budget when Finance Minister Morarji Desai resigned protesting against the nationalization of fourteen Indian private banks without consulting him. Similarly, in 1987-88, the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi presented the budget when Finance Minister VP Singh resigned.

Paperless Budget

In 2023, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the first-ever paperless Budget, as she read her speech from a tablet. Earlier in 2019, she ditched the colonial tradition of carrying the Budget in a briefcase. The finance minister adopted the traditional ‘bahi khata’ to present the Budget document. The documents were wrapped in a silk red cloth with the national emblem on top.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-here-are-interesting-facts-about-budget-over-the-years-3338746/
financialexpress.com,Budget 2024: What is an Interim Budget? How is it different from Union Budget?,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will announce the interim budget for the year 2024-25 on February 1, 2024 with no major announcements ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections scheduled for early next year. The full budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, however, will be presented after the formation of the new government following the general elections.

India appears to be a bright spot amid the overall dim global economic outlook. India’s economic growth projections for FY24 range from 6.3 per cent (International Monetary Fund and World Bank) to 6.5 per cent (RBI). As against this, the IMF’s projections for global growth indicate a decline from 3.5 per cent in 2022 to 3 per cent in 2023 and further to 2.9 per cent in 2024.

So, what really is an interim budget?



An interim budget is presented by a government that is going through a transition period or is in its last year in office before the general elections held every 5 years. An incumbent government cannot present a full Union Budget in the election year and instead, the finance minister presents an interim budget during the joint sitting of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha in Parliament.

The interim budget contains detailed documentation of all the expenses to be incurred and every rupee to be earned through taxes in the coming few months until the elections. With this budget, the incumbent government seeks a vote of approval from Parliament to extract money from the consolidated fund of India, where the government puts all its revenue, to meet its budget expenses before the end of the financial year. The interim budget, besides a full estimate of the revenue and expenditure, also consist of some policy measures. In recent times, interim budgets have been instrumental for the incumbent governments to list out their achievements to draw voters’ support.

What can be and cannot be included in interim budgets?

In the interim budget, the ruling government presents estimates of its expenditure, revenue, fiscal deficit and financial performance and projections for the upcoming financial year. At the end of its tenure, the ruling government presents an interim budget for three to four months to keep the country running. The likely focus of the incumbent government in this budget can be to outline its economic vision for the next five years, should it return to power.

However, an interim budget does not make any major policy announcements which could financially burden the next government that will present the full Union Budget. According to the Election Commission’s Code of Conduct, the ruling government cannot include any major scheme in the Interim Budget as it could influence the voters. Also, the government in power does not present the Economic Survey along with the Interim Budget.

A Budget has two parts – the report of expenses and income in the previous year and the proposed expenses and income generation in the coming year. In the interim budget, the first part will remain the same. However, the second part will contain documentation of only basic expenses until the election.

Now, what is a ‘Vote on Account’? The ‘Vote on Account’ is just the estimate of expenses the outgoing government requires before the general elections. The ‘Vote on Account’ only deals with the government’s expenditures. The ‘Vote on Account’ is normally valid for two months but can be extended.

Is it essential for the incumbent government to present the interim budget? While the government can choose to not present an interim budget and just get the funds required for spending via the ‘vote on account’ route, but as per convention, the governments usually opt for an interim budget in the election year.",Center,,https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/budget-2024-what-is-an-interim-budget-how-is-it-different-from-union-budget-3335642/

Amongst the various segments hoping and sharing their suggestions with the government, the Indian Automotive industry is optimistic and upbeat about the coming budget.

Financial Express Online spoke with industry leaders to understand their expectations and wishlists.



Vinod Aggarwal, President, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said, “We are not expecting any special sops from the government. They should not create any sudden disruptions, they should continue with good policies, infrastructure investments, and stability in regulations, and not introduce regulatory norms. Any new norms also lead to an increase in costs. They should not levy or come out with surprises.”

Vinnie Mehta, Director General, Automotive Components Manufacturers Association tells Financial Express Online, ‘’2024 being an election year, the February budget is most likely going to be a vote on account. Having said that, I must credit the government for its benign policies especially the PLI and the FAME which have greatly benefitted the automotive ecosystem. We are hopeful that these will continue to receive generous budgetary allocations. Having said that, there are a few cases of inverted duty structure with regard to GST in the case of EVs and some of their components which are being taken up with the GST council.’’
